		"paragraph": "When people talk about influenza , a general focus of the conversation is the physical symptoms fever , congestion , muscle aches , and chills . In the vast majority of flu cases , these subside within a few weeks , and the virus disappears . But if you ve ever felt the mental fog that comes with illness linger after physical symptoms disappear , there might now be science to explain why . A study released this week in the Journal of Neuroscience found evidence that certain strains of influenza can cause neurological changes in the brain long after the illness is gone . With research performed on mice , the study is a look at an aspect of influenza that has been largely overlooked in this current epidemic , which has killed dozens of children in the United States since October and has infected tens of thousands of people nationwide . For this particular examination , researchers from Germany s Braunschweig University of Technology chose to infect mice with three different strains of influenza . The first , H1N1 , was the culprit in 2009 s swine flu pandemic the second , H7N7 , is a version that s rare in humans and the third , H3N2 , is the current strain spreading through the United States . The goal was to find out what , if any , lingering effects all three would have on the brain . In order to measure this , researchers used the Morris Water Maze a standardized test in which mice have to find a platform hidden below water . How quickly they find it and which research cues they use allows researchers to closely measure changes in spatial learning and memory . Both rely heavily on a region of the brain called the hippocampus , a center of learning , emotion , and memory . After the mice recovered from their respective influenza strains , the researchers put their navigation skills to the test and found obvious differences in performance based on which strain of the flu the mice had . In the first 30 days , mice infected with either H3N2 or H7N7 had more trouble locating the hidden platform signaling neurological damage to their hippocampal region . In some of the mice , this damage persisted for 60 days . For reasons that are still unclear , no changes were recorded in the mice infected with H1N1 . One of the lead researchers on the study , Martin Korte , a neurobiologist at Braunschweig University of Technology , says it s not unlikely that these symptoms are mirrored in humans . In terms of single brain neurons and immune cells in the brain , humans and mice are very much alike , Korte tells Yahoo Lifestyle . So , overall , we believe that the cognitive defects we observed in young mice are also very relevant for humans . Korte says observing the mice become slower and less precise after the flu is significant but should n t be cause for alarm . The effect was visible and obvious , but we have by no means induced Alzheimer s - like symptoms in young mice , he says . The story might be different in old mice , and also in older humans . Based on his research , the brain effects of the flu could last for roughly 30 days in young adults , and potentially longer in the older population . There is some indication that in [ older populations ] it could lead to mild cognitive impairment that lasts , Korte tells Yahoo Lifestyle . As far as we can judge from preliminary experiments , the initial immune response in old mice is stronger and long-lasting . Further studies need to be done to deduce the larger impact in older populations , but for younger ones , Korte suggests trying to limit difficult activities in the aftermath of a flu . In younger people , they should worry about the four to eight weeks after the infection , Korte says . Taking an exam , for example , might be more difficult . In terms of prevention , he sees an obvious solution : Get vaccinated , Korte tells Yahoo Lifestyle . It appears that the strength of the initial response leads to strong neurological effects , and with a vaccination , this response is much weaker . On top of that , he recommends hand washing and for those who do contract the virus taking time to fully recover at home . To be clear , the study is not aimed at proving the flu precipitates long-term brain damage . Rather Korte hopes it will raise awareness about how the virus can affect the way our brains work and prompt other researchers to take a closer look at this . We need to rethink the assumption that the brain is an immune-privileged organ , Korte says . And it is a stronger reminder that infection should be taken seriously in terms of both treatment and research . The more seriously we take [ it ] , the better our chance of success .

		"paragraph": "With cybersecurity a top concern at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Switzerland , Yahoo Finance asked experts : What is the topic or topics that business and government leaders should be focusing on when it comes to cybersecurity and policy in 2018 ? Jason Glassberg , co-founder of Casaba Security , responded that currently the most pressing topics are cryptocurrency ecosystems , election security , â€˜ DevSecOps ( this may sound dull , but think : IoT , cars , airline computer systems , smart homes , smart cities , Intel chips , Juniper routers , Huawei , the Internet , basically everything digital under the sun ) , increased regulation , cyber warfare , and attribution . Glassberg broke down each of these six issues : Cryptocurrency is obviously a major financial story these days . Everybody and their brother is looking into how to capitalize on it . These markets are notoriously murky , however fraud and scams are rampant , as are the cyber attacks . So how do you make it safe ? How do you take a Wild West gunslinging town , and turn it into the suburbs ? It s a tough issue , and I think we ll have to look at the gambling industry as an example . The key to this is establishing better security within this ecosystem for the real players . The next step is finding a way to guarantee losses due to theft , similar to the FDIC [ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ] or SIPC [ Securities Investor Protection Corporation ] . Election security needs no introduction . But while everybody has been freaking out about voter suppression via phony Facebook ads , the reality is that the 2016 election interference was just a sample . It was a nation-state gently dipping its toe in the water , but deciding not to go all the way in . If a country wanted to get serious about election attacks , it could go much further . This is what we need to be prepared for . It would be possible for a serious player to delete or alter voter registration databases , DDoS the servers used to run those database or the actual voting machines not to mention , hack the voting machines themselves . The latter would definitely cross a red line , if for instance we found out that Russia had re-tabulated voting machines to directly affect the outcome of an election . But what if the attack was a little less black-and-white ? For instance , what if the machines were just infected with random malware that did n t actually do anything , other than make itself known to the IT team ? That would send shockwaves through the system and call into question the voting results , even though the votes were n t actually affected . This is what we need to be thinking about . DevSecOps is one of those terms that causes people s eyes to glaze over when they hear it ( if they ever do ) , but it s actually very relevant to our lives today . What it refers to is incorporating security into the software or hardware development process . This is hugely significant today because as we re seeing with the Internet of Things devices that are flooding the market , and the connected cars that are rolling out onto our public streets , software security is usually not the first priority of these manufacturers . But not to just pick on those two markets , the reality is that DevSecOps is a problem for every industry on the planet , even the security field . Businesses are n t doing enough to bake in rigorous security into the DNA of their products from the very beginning . Too often they are relying on software updates and patches to fix the problem after the fact , and that is never an ideal solution . This will continue to become a bigger issue in the months and years ahead . Increased regulation is another issue that businesses could face , as governments try to contend with the growing risk of data breaches and attacks on key infrastructure , whether it s the GDPR [ General Data Protection Regulation ] in Europe or the Singapore Cybersecurity Bill . In my own opinion , I think that companies that store consumer data ( whether it s credit card numbers or credit reports ) , as well as private infrastructure entities like telecom and power companies , are probably most at risk of higher costs due to regulation . Cyber warfare is another pressing issue today , as more countries are investing in offensive cyber operations . This often puts businesses in the crosshairs and it sticks government in a tough position too because there is no easy solution for preventing or responding to these incidents . A key question when it comes to cyber warfare is do we engage in active defense ? That is more commonly referred to as hack-back , but it s a more complex concept than simply tit-for-tat cyber retaliation . Active defense can mean anything from advanced investigative techniques to disabling the servers behind an attack or turning a city s lights off for 30 minutes in order to send a message to a rival nation . How we deter and respond to cyber warfare tactics will be a key question for policymakers and businesses over the next five to 10 years . Attribution is another ongoing issue for governments and businesses , and it s related directly to the cyber warfare question , although it also encompasses cybercrime as well . What s also key with attribution is that the pressure to solve these cases could lead to encroachments on digital privacy . In fact , I d be very surprised if that did not happen . Potential targets here include Tor , VPNs , and encryption tools in general . Read more expert cybersecurity advice for business leaders and policymakers .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the Bury Me Here episode of The Walking Dead contains spoilers . A quick opening scene hints at some imminent heartbreak , as King Ezekiel somberly oversees the loading of a single cantaloupe into a truck usually used for the delivery of offerings to the Saviors . But we do n t know just how crushing the season s 13th episode will be , as two Kingdom dwellers will be dead , and a trio of characters who wanted to avoid fighting at all costs have to finally acknowledge there s just no peace to be kept when it comes to living under the thumb of Negan and the Saviors . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead Star Melissa McBride on Carol s Nightmares and Daryl s Sacrifice Is It Just Too Late to Get Away ? At her house , Carol is awakened by a nightmare . She wakes up and has a smoke , but it does n t calm her down , and she s teary as she appears troubled by something . The next morning , she sets off for the Kingdom , where Morgan is training Benjamin s brother , Henry , in the ways of staff fighting . Henry had previously told Morgan he wanted to be able to knock his big brother down with the staff , but Morgan gets him to admit he really just wants to be like Benjamin . On her brief road trip , Carol knocks down one walker , then cleverly uses the stabby end of a One Way road sign to take out several others who are stalking the community s front gate . The guards see her efforts and open up and let her enter , and while Benjamin wants to chat about her bada ** ery , Carol just wants to see Morgan . She finds him in his room and gets right to the point of her pop-in : her Spidey senses have been tingling about what Daryl told her , that Rick and the others had defeated Negan , and that everything between the Alexandrians and the Saviors is now hunky-dory . She wants to know if that s true , she tells Morgan , because she does n t get why Jesus would have brought Rick , Daryl , and the others to the Kingdom if the Saviors were not a threat . But Morgan points out to her that he kept her story , her whereabouts , to himself , just as she had asked . So if she wants to discuss what Daryl told her , she is going to have to discuss it with Daryl . He even offers to accompany her on a trip to Alexandria for the chat apparently assuming Daryl returned home instead of to the Hilltop . Carol s upset , and Morgan asks her if she found what she was looking for during her self-imposed exile . Or is it just too late to get away ? he asks . She leaves the Kingdom without definitive answers , but clearly even more suspicious that all is not well with her friends . On her way out , Benjamin asks her if he can walk with her back to the house , and she tells him no . He just wants to see how she does what she does with the walkers , he tells her , saying he can skip the meetup with the Saviors to learn from her . She tells him to go to the meetup and keeps walking . Outside the gates , she spots the walker she knocked down , but did n t kill , earlier . He s now dead , via a stab to the head , and laying in a pool of blood . She looks around , trying to see who might have taken him out . No one s in sight . But lurking around the corner of a building : it s Richard , who puts his daughter , Katy s , backpack on the ground and starts covering it with the dirt he s digging up . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead Postmortem : Lennie James on Morgan s Breakdown and Why He Kills Again Weevil Woes Inside the Kingdom , Ezekiel is looking over the community from a level above the garden , where Daniel is picking cantaloupes . Shiva is beside the king , which provides no comfort to Nabila , the resident garden expert who arrives with bad news : there s a weevil problem afoot , and within a week , it could wipe out a big portion of the crops . That would mean not only loss of food for the Kingdomites , but loss of the goods Ezekiel gifts the Saviors to keep them calm and non-murdery . Nabila says she s sorry , but the royal garden will have to be cut and burned , so the courtyard crops can be saved . Here s the beautiful thing , your majesty , she says . You can tear it out and cut it down , you can burn it and throw it all away , but if you want , it can all grow back . Ezekiel smiles at her insight that applies in so many big picture ways , and Shiva even offers up a little growl , as if to say she appreciates Nabila , too . Okay , I think I just pissed myself , Nabila responds , and officially becomes the best new character introduced since the beloved Jerry . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead : Scott Gimple on Sparking Morgan s Trauma and the New Jerry Who s the Girl ? Benjamin goes to Morgan s room to tell him they ll be leaving in five minutes to drop off the latest offering to the Saviors . He also returns the book Morgan lent him The Art of Peace , the book Eastman gave Morgan and presents Morgan with a gift : a scavenged painting of a warrior with a gun , which Benjamin asked a female friend to alter and cover the gun with a staff . Morgan hangs it on his wall right away , and teasingly asks Benjamin who the girl is , one of the sweet signs that their mentor/mentee relationship has deepened and now includes a father/son-type connection . Outside near the delivery truck , Morgan is waiting to leave when Richard approaches him . Richard tells Morgan about his family , a wife and a child , and how he has the perfect family , the perfect life . I did n t ask for much , and I got more than I deserved , he says . And you ? Morgan just nods . Richard then apologizes , sorry that they have butted heads . He thinks Morgan is wrong in assuming the uneasy peace with the Saviors will last , he says , but he knows Morgan is a good man . But the day s coming with you ca n t be that good , Richard tells him . When that happens , do n t beat yourself up about it . Jerry moment alert : Jerry s still noshing on a heap of cobbler as the group prepares to depart . Ezekiel tells him to leave it behind . Really ? Jerry sadly asks , his beard full of cobbler crumbs . Jerry ! Ezekiel says sharply , before looking at his sidekick s dessert-lovin face and telling him he can take the cobbler . Big smile from Jerry , the last one we ll see this episode . In route to the meeting , the group spots a string of shopping carts blocking the road . They all get out to investigate , with Richard telling them to keep their guns drawn and aimed , as the roadblock might be a trap . They all look around the area and stumble upon a grave , which appears to be freshly dug . There s a handwritten sign near it that reads , Bury Me Here . This world drives one mad , Ezekiel says , but Benjamin assures him , You made us another world . They load back into the truck and arrive at the meetup , but Savior group leader Gavin is unhappy that they are late . He does n t want to hear Ezekiel s excuse about the roadblock , and when Jerry warns him , Do n t interrupt the King ! long-haired super creep Jared uses the staff he previously stole from Morgan to clock Jerry in the face . Benjamin calls him a rat-faced prick , and the whole incident has just angered Gavin even more . He tells Ezekiel not to bring that your highness s ** t to them , and warns that thinks have been unnecessarily tense during their encounters lately . He did n t go this route to be stressed , he says . He asks for the offering , and walks over to the truck to check it out . His response to the goods is to immediately demand Ezekiel and his people hand over their guns , too . The King objects , and the Saviors and the Kingdomites draw their guns and point them at each other . Gavin says they can either use their guns or give them to the Saviors , but both Richard and Morgan try to squash the situation by telling Ezekiel they should give up the guns . They do , and Gavin says he demanded the weapons because things are about to get emotional , and Ezekiel s people have proven they do n t respond well to emotional . Gavin says the delivery is short . There are supposed to be 12 cantaloupes , but there are only 11 . Ezekiel is shocked , but when Gavin tells him to check , he sees there are only 11 . He knows there were 12 in the truck when he counted them before they left the Kingdom , but Gavin does n t care . Right now is the only time that matters , Gavin says when Ezekiel offers to get more from home and return with them immediately . We re going to deal with this right now . The rat-faced Jared hears this and aims his gun at Richard s head , but suddenly aims elsewhere and fires twice . He shoots Benjamin in the thigh , and the Kingdomites gather around him , panicked that he s going to bleed to death before they can get him home to treat him . Ezekiel just wants to leave , but Gavin cautions he must return the next day with one cantaloupe . They pack Benjamin into the truck , and have to call for a stunned Richard to climb in quickly . They speed off towards the Kingdom , and stop when they reach Carol s cottage . They carry Benjamin in , but he s losing blood too quickly for them to save him . He looks at Morgan and repeats something earlier he d quoted as a favorite passage from The Art of Peace : To injure an opponent is to injure yourself . Morgan , and Richard , and Ezekiel are all devastated when Benjamin dies seconds later . Morgan storms out and walks towards the Kingdom , but stops at the area where he and his friends had been forced to stop to clear the shopping cart blockade earlier . Morgan begins to meltdown , ranting , talking to himself , flashing back in his mind to signs and the walls of his apartment in Season 3 s Clear . He goes to the grave , the one with the Bury Me Here sign , and sits in it , and holds his knife to his wrist . He s still angry , losing control , now out of the grave and flashing back to his dead son Duane , his dead wife , and he and Benjamin joking before they left on the ill-fated trip to give the Saviors 11 cantaloupes . He s so filled with rage that he kicks at a yellow plastic bin , sending it flying . When it does , something rolls towards him . It s one cantaloupe . You . Have . To . Kill Morgan bursts into Richard s room and tosses the yellow bin on the floor . Richard s busted and he knows it . He set up the shopping cart roadblock , so the group would have to stop . When they did , he sneakily took one cantaloupe off the truck and hid it . He knew the shortage would make Gavin angry , and provoke an attack . Gavin had previously said any punishment necessary would first be aimed at Richard , so Richard assumed he would die hence the Bury Me Here grave he dug when we saw him shoveling dirt earlier and that his death would push Ezekiel and Morgan into realizing they needed to go to war against the Saviors . As Morgan stands there saying nothing , Richard tells him how he lost his wife and child at a camp after the apocalypse started . I knew they had problems , he says , but I did n t think they were mine to solve . He thought smarter , stronger people would step up , he tells Morgan , and because he waited , and did nothing , his family died . He tries to convince Morgan they can use Benjamin s death to their advantage and move ahead with his plan . When they deliver the cantaloupe to Gavin the next day , they should assure him they understand what happened , and that they are willing and able to move past it , that we know how to go on . This will eventually lull the Saviors into trusting them again , make them vulnerable , and then they can attack and kill Gavin and his men . Then they ll join in with Rick and wipe out all the Saviors , he says . Morgan : You . Have . To . Kill ! Or else you might as well kill yourself , Richard says . He says someone had to die , and he wanted it to be him . That did n t work out . So , I ll be the one to lead our army . He also assures Morgan he ll tell Ezekiel and everyone else in the group what he did , and will live the rest of his life making up for Benjamin s death . The next day , in the scene that played out to open the episode , the group packs up one cantaloupe and heads off for another meeting with Gavin . When they arrive , before the Saviors , Morgan asks Richard if he told Ezekiel . Richard says he ll tell him when they get back . The King wants to know what they re talking about , and insists they has it out now , but before they can , Gavin and company arrive . Gavin asks how the kid is , and the silence and devastated looks that greet him tells him Benjamin died . He walks over to rat-faced Jared and orders him to start walking home , before he kills him . He tells him not to even throw a look at Ezekiel and his people , or he ll kill him . Rat-faced Jared walks off . Gavin asks for and receives the melon , and Richard speaks up . I just want to say , we get it â€¦ but before he can finish , Morgan attacks him . He tackles him to the ground , strangles him , and pounds Richard s head into the ground until he s dead . Shocked Ezekiel and the group look on . Morgan tells them , Richard set the whole thing up with the missing melon . They had the whole offering , he says to Gavin , but Richard hid one to try to provoke Gavin to attack them . He assumed he would be the one to die , Morgan says , and when they shot Benjamin instead , Richard wanted to show you we get it , we know how to go on , Morgan continues , using the exact words Richard had planned to use on Gavin . Gavin says he ll see them at the next drop-off , and the Saviors leave . Ezekiel is still shocked , and angry , as it sinks in what Richard did . He wanted to die for us , Morgan says . He wanted it to be him â€¦ thought he could choose , and that s why Duane had to die . Duane ? Ezekiel asks . Morgan gets choked up , struggles to regain and maintain his composure . Benjamin , Benjamin â€¦ that s why Benjamin â€¦ he says . Ezekiel gently urges Morgan to come home with the group , but Morgan refuses . After the others have left , he drags Richard s body to the Bury Me Here grave . He s covering him with the mound of dirt Richard dug , when he spots the Katy backpack . He picks it up , realizing what it is , and puts it atop Richard s grave before he finishes burying him . Morgan angrily walks along the nearby street , killing walkers with a new aggressiveness . He does n t just stab them with his staff , he jumps at them , acting like a killing machine instead of a man simply doing what he has to to protect himself and others . Knock , Knock Morgan arrives at Carol s door , and when she answers , he asks , Do you really wan na know what happened in Alexandria ? What happened to you ? she asks . He tells her he killed Richard , strangled him , because he s the one who got Benjamin killed . Do you wan na know what happened in Alexandria ? he asks again . Carol slowly nods . Yeah . He tells her : Negan killed Glenn and Abraham , beating them to death with a baseball bat . Now , Rick and the others are all living under Negan s control . He also killed Spencer and Olivia , and the reason Jesus brought Rick and Daryl and the others to the Kingdom is because Rick wants to form an army to attack Negan . You wanted to know , Morgan tells her . Now you do . He stalks off , and when she asks him where he s going , he tells her , I m gon na kill â€˜ em . Out there . One by one . She asks him to wait , telling him he can stay at the house , instead . You can go , she says , pointing to the house , and not go . Please â€¦ please . Carol packs up her stuff , and with a bag , arrives at the Kingdom . She finds Ezekiel , who s replanting his garden , alongside Henry . Carol tells The King she s sorry about Benjamin . She also tells him she s going to stay there now , because they have to get ready . They have to fight , she says . We do , Ezekiel agrees . But not today , and they both join Henry to replant more of the garden . Meanwhile , back at Carol s cottage , Morgan is sitting on the porch , sharpening his staff into a point , all the better , and more efficient , to stab living humans instead of walking dead ones . Zombie Bites : * Macsen Lintz , the young actor who plays Benjamin s now heartbroken little brother , Henry , is the real-life little bro of Madison Lintz , the actress who played Carol s daughter , Sophia , on Seasons 1 and 2 . * Before Morgan leaves Carol s house after Benjamin s death , he wipes his knife on the sheet covering the body . It did n t happen on camera , but do we think he was the one to stab his young friend in the brain , to prevent him from reanimating ? * Better Call Saul fans , do you recognize Nadine Marissa , the actress who plays Nabila ? In Saul Season 1 and 2 , she played the courthouse administrator , the one who became much friendlier to Jimmy when he gifted her with Beanie Babies .

		"paragraph": "Smartphone makers released a slew of new handsets this year with big screens and high-quality cameras . And more than a few were up for the top spot in this list . But when it came time to pick the absolute best handset of the year , I kept coming back to Apple s iPhone 6s . Let the hate mailing commence . Before you get yourself all worked into a tizzy about me being an Apple fanboy , you should know I use a Samsung Galaxy S6 as my personal phone . So why choose the iPhone 6s as the best smartphone of 2015 when it looks exactly like the iPhone 6 ? The simple answer is because Apple has taken an already winning formula and honed it even further . The iPhone 6s is not only faster than its predecessor it also gets Apple s new 3D Touch , which fundamentally changes the way you interact with apps by letting you press harder on the screen to access more features and options . There s also a new 12-megapixel camera , though photos taken with the iPhone 6s look about the same as those shot on the iPhone 6 which is to say they re beautiful . The iPhone 6s s win was n t a blowout , though , as it barely beat out Samsung s Galaxy Note5 . In fact , if it were n t for the iPhone 6s s 3D Touch , the Note5 with its incredible camera , gorgeous display , chic design , and lightning-fast performance would have taken the crown . Google s Nexus 5X also deserves props for matching up with other smartphones in terms of performance at nearly half the price . The reason it missed the top spot is it is n t built as well as iPhone 6s or Note5 . It s essentially a nondescript block of plastic . On top of that , the Nexus 5X s display is n t nearly as vibrant as the iPhone 6s s or Note5 s . The final runner-up for best smartphone of 2015 is Motorola and Verizon s new Droid Turbo 2 . The phone is n t exactly breathtaking in terms of design or performance , but what makes the Droid Turbo 2 shine is its nearly shatterproof display . Even after dropping the handset down a flight of stairs upwards of 10 times , its screen did n t have so much as a scratch . Now if only Apple could do the same to the iPhone . Next year , Apple will likely release an iPhone with a new , updated design , but fewer tech improvements . Non - s model iPhones , like the iPhone 6 , tend to put a focus on upgraded looks , while those with s designations , like the iPhone 6s , usually get improved cameras and performance features . Outside of that , you can expect to see the same more powerful smartphones with sharper displays and improved cameras . But as with every year , we re certain to see at least a few surprises .

		"paragraph": "The day after Halloween is often a time for kids to recover from the candy-filled holiday and for parents to figure out what to do with yet another year s worth of costumes ( and , let s be honest , how to hide/eat all that candy ) . There are likely some local efforts that involve giving Halloween donations to your community s church , shelter or other group . But there are also other options for giving costumes a second chance that might not be on many parents radars . Here are three things to do with your kids ( and maybe even your own ) gently used Halloween costumes . The Halloween Helpers began in 2008 when Emma Rose Shapiro , who was 11 at the time , gathered her gently used costumes and dance class outfits to give to families who did n t have the resources to buy a costume . She asked her community to help , too . Ten years later , her mother , Ilyse Shapiro , estimates that including this Halloween season , the team has sent out about 8,000 costumes . Ilyse told HuffPost kids come in all shapes and sizes so The Halloween Helpers accept new or gently used but clean costumes at their P.O. box in Pennsylvania in sizes for infants , children and adults ( as long as they re appropriate ) . The team then sends them out to places like community centers , nonprofits , shelters , children s museums and similar locations nationwide and sometimes around the world . Ilyse said she typically sees an increase in donated costumes the week after Halloween , but the team accepts donations year-round . They also take accessories like wands and tiaras , as long as they correspond with the donated costume . Ween Dream is a similar nonprofit dedicated to making sure every kid who wants to dress up for Halloween has the opportunity . In 2012 , Kelsey Meeks teamed up with a local organization in Louisiana to collect and donate costumes for kids , and two years later , she started Ween Dream . Meeks said the organization has donated to kids in 38 states this year alone . The nonprofit sees the biggest booms in used costume deliveries to its Louisiana storage space address in the first few weeks after Halloween as well as in the spring . The organization aims to help many people , including families living at or below the poverty level or families affected by a traumatic event like a natural disaster . Earlier this month , the Ween Dream team sent costumes to Panama City , Florida , for families impacted by Hurricane Michael . Ween Dream also has a feature called the Pumpkin Patch , a project in which people can sponsor children and buy them brand new costumes . This includes kids that do n t have a suitable option available in Ween Dream s used costume inventory and children with various medical issues . This means kids with sensitive skin , a weakened immune system , physical limitations or other conditions can have a costume that fits them and their needs . Meeks encouraged people to donate not only costumes , but masks and dance outfits as well . We get requests for dance costumes just as frequently as Halloween costumes , she said . For kids who want to be ballerinas and dancers , especially if they re living in poverty or at shelters , their families often ca n t afford to put them in classes . Poshmark , a platform where sellers can list gently used clothes for men , women and children , saw a huge increase in kids Halloween costumes for sale this past September and October . To put your costume listing above the rest , Kate Franco , Poshmark s senior director of brand marketing , advised sellers to upload appealing images , including at least one photo of the costume modeled . It s helpful to include the phrase Halloween costume in the item s description as well as the brand , color and the age range for kids who might like and fit into it . Kids Halloween costumes sell four times faster in September and October on Poshmark , but do n t hesitate to list the item right after Halloween and consider dropping the price since it might not be in high demand , said Franco . ThredUP is another popular secondhand clothing platform . It allows its users to send in bags of used children s and women s clothing that its team evaluates for resale . The standards are high since the company only accepts about 40 percent of the items in the average bag and either recycles or includes the rest in its Rescues program ( unless users opt in to have their unaccepted items returned ) . Kathleen Weng , ThredUP s vice president of merchandising , confirmed that the company accepts kids Halloween costumes year-round , but does n t accept adults costumes . She said the outfits must be in good condition with no missing pieces or accessories . Homemade and violent costumes ( or anything with weapons ) are not accepted . As HuffPost previously noted , social media platforms can be helpful in selling anything from clothes to furniture to electronics . Diana Blinkhorn , the mom of three behind the blog The Gray Ruby Diaries , is an avid Facebook Marketplace user and often sells her family s store-bought costumes as well as the creative costumes she makes for the holiday . Last year I sold my old and unused Halloween costumes and was able to make enough money to cover the entire cost of the new ones , she told HuffPost via email . Blinkhorn said she especially likes the ability to check out prospective buyers Facebook profiles before accepting sales . She typically sells costumes and accessories like masks for 50 to 60 percent of their original price . To get the highest price for a costume , Blinkhorn suggested that parents save it for the following October , right before Halloween . All told , in many cases , used costumes can find new life elsewhere . Whether you try out one of these suggestions , add the costume to your kid s dress-up collection , pass it on to another sibling or choose another method , there s often a better place for these outfits besides your cluttered closet , your stuffy attic or a landfill .",

Before the Trump administration s policy of separating children from their parents at the border gained national attention , she was a less well-known Cabinet member , and she reportedly considered resigning after President Trump berated her at a meeting for failing to secure the border . As a veteran of the George W. Bush administration , she was viewed with distrust , and some Trump officials were reportedly hoping to use the border crisis to scapegoat and fire her . Then at Monday s White House press briefing , Nielsen offered cold , technical responses on children being ripped away from their parents , and claimed falsely that only Congress can fix the issue . CNN reportsthat members of the Trump administration were impressed : Inside , Nielsen was confronted by protesters from the group Metro D.C. Democratic Socialists of America . While Secret Service agents prevented the demonstrators from approaching Nielsen and her companion , they were able to stand in the restaurant and heckle Nielsen about the family separation policy . Video shows this went on for at least ten minutes , as Nielsen looked at her phone and did n t acknowledge the activists . She was in the corner on her phone , just staring at her phone . Not engaging at all , witness Erica Olmstead told the Daily News . She said some other patrons were noticeably ambivalent about the scene , but others joined in , clapping and chanting at Nielsen . We will not stand by and let Secretary Nielsen dine in peace , while she is directing her employees to tear little girls away from their mothers and crying boys away from their fathers at our border , Margaret McLaughlin , a member Metro DC DSA s steering committee , said in a statement . Secretary Nielsen and everyone else who has carried out these brutal and cold-blooded orders to rip apart families should never be allowed to eat and drink in public again .

Nick Saban has a web series featuring him and former Alabama football players chatting in a barbershop . It s called Shop Talk . Recently , James threatened Saban with legal action , claiming that Saban s show was ripping off the concept of people talking in a barbershop that James apparently believes he owns . Nick Saban snapped back and promised to continue with his show citing 20 barbershop-type things I ve seen on TV to counter James claim that the idea is his company s intellectual property . Eddie Murphy , Ice Cube and Floyd from Mayberry certainly understand Saban s point of view . The conflict has spawned a petty public squabble between two of sports most powerful men . Now James finds himself on the receiving end of barbershop-show related legal action , though not from Saban or Alabama . A company called Adventure Enterprises is suing James , claiming that it pitched a barbershop show to Uninterrupted and was cut out when The Shop became a reality , TMZ reports . The lawsuit claims that Adventure Enterprises talked with James company multiple times over the course of two years about the idea and is seeking an injunction to stop the show from airing along with cash damages , according to the report . The suit also claims that Uninterrupted apologized after the first episode of The Shop ran and promised not to run another before a second clip ran on ESPN . A representative close to James and business partner Maverick Carter , who is also being sued , called the suit totally frivolous and publicity seeking in an interview with TMZ . It seems that most of this dialogue is frivolous and publicity seeking . It s also entertaining , so keep it coming fellas .

		"paragraph": "On April 2 , Spike TV premieres Lip Sync Battle , an expanded version of Jimmy Fallon s popular Tonight Show duels in which stars face off lip-syncing two songs each . Fallon is among the executive producers , as are fellow competitors John Krasinski and Stephen Merchant . Yahoo TV phoned EP Casey Patterson , who s also the EVP of Talent Development and Production for Viacom Entertainment Group , to find out exactly how the show works . 1 . Do participants get to choose their opponent ? Yes . \" We generally start with one person who we know would be fantastic at it , and they generally have very specific ideas about who they want to go up against , \" Patterson says . \" In a half-hour show , you have the ability to show more of the rivalry between them , which is half the fun . \" Empire stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard , for instance , will battle in a special hour-long season finale . What makes this show so much fun to produce and so much fun to watch , in my opinion , is that the celebrities are so committed . They pick something silly and they commit hard to it , and those two were the most competitive we had all season , Patterson says . Their relationship goes back to Hustle & Flow , and they know each other so well , and obviously the characters that they play [ on Empire ] sort of help with that chemistry , but those two came to win . They were friends before and they ll be friends after , but that was on pause for our show . She also says the Devil Wears Prada reunion between Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway in the April 9 episode is one for the ages : They re best friends , and the competitiveness between the two of them was ridiculous . Watch an exclusive clip of Blunt lip-syncing No Diggity below . 2 . Who really picks the songs ? The stars . We decided that the best possible version of the show is if we do n t feed them the songs , that people come up with the songs on their own , because everybody has something that they sing in their car , or a break-up song , or just their jam from high school . The more they know the song and the more emotionally connected they are to the song , the better , Patterson says . Because they get two songs , they usually try to make one of them unexpected as Krasinski and Anna Kendrick each managed to do in their battle airing April 16 . Anna Kendrick did â€˜ Booty and she broke into the Pitbull rap she just crushed it , Patterson says . And John Krasinski , when he did â€˜ Proud Mary â€¦ just his fitting with his dress could have been a stand-alone half hour . He was very specific about how much fringe . And what happens if two stars pick the same song ? We ve had that many times , and when people ca n t get their song , like , the one that they knew they could win with , it s tough , Patterson admits . We have to get back on the phone and we just go through the soundtrack of their life . 3 . Will we get to see the preparation ? Yes . We ll get to see the visits to wardrobe , rehearsals , backstage , everything . We ve been saying this a lot about the show , but it s the most classic form of old-school variety : the hair and makeup department is right next door to the wardrobe department , which is right next door to the choreographer and our troupe of dancers that are always the same . Everybody s sort of mashed together , sort of like you re joining the circus , Patterson says . Generally , stars would have weeks or months of notice ( though , she notes , some were booked just the day before if an opportunity presented itself and they were comfortable performing ) . The rhythm of the show is that people love the idea , and they [ practice ] at home , and it s going to be so exciting , and they get all wrapped up in it , she says . Then when you get really close to it , it s â€˜ Oh my God , I m actually going to do this . They get really nervous . â€˜ Wait a minute . People are going to see this . And this ? As they come onto the stage , there s always the same look . It s just this wide-eyed , â€˜ Oh my God , what have I done ? Producers recommend stars spend at least 30-45 minutes rehearsing with them . \" On other shows , you worry if you re going to get enough rehearsal time . Talent does n t generally like to do that they ve got it and on this show , they could n t get enough , \" Patterson says . \" They want to come and rehearse . They want to see the stage . They want to do multiple fittings . They want it to be great . Everybody s playing to win . \" Henson and Howard made a full day of it . They were going to rehearse and leave , and they decided just to move into the dressing rooms . They ordered food . They met with the choreographer multiple times . They really got into wardrobe , she says . We film the entire experience , from the time they arrive until the time they leave . Patterson notes that Dwayne Johnson , who takes on Fallon in the April 2 premiere , essentially produced himself : He had the wardrobe , he cut the song down himself , he knew exactly what he was going to do . I think he even helped us to clear his song . 4 . And they really do n t know what songs their opponent is doing ? \" They do n t know the songs , and they certainly do n t know the production element for the second song , \" Patterson says . \" They have to go into hair and makeup before we even bring their opponent down to rehearse . We have to work very hard to keep everyone separated so we do n t give away the surprise . They put so much time and thought into the song choice , into the production value , how they re going to win , and seeing the look on someone s face when their opponent comes out is gold . So we are very , very protective of that process . \" 5 . Are they allowed second takes ? Yes . But , Patterson says , I do n t think we had it happen at all in the first season . I think we had one technical problem , but nobody going , â€˜ I want to do that again . They give it [ their ] all , and the good news is it s not about being perfect . It s just about being ridiculously committed . That s really how you win . 6 . We know what LL Cool J does as host , but what is Chrissy Teigen s role as color commentator ? \" Really , she s supposed to do commentary after each performance , but she gives commentary whenever she feels like it , \" Patterson says , laughing . \" He s such a good buttoned-up , professional host , then Chrissy is a wild card . You never know what she s going to say or what she s going to do , and it definitely keeps him on his toes . She s just a little bit dangerous , in the very best way â€¦ When you watch the cutaways of Chrissy , you would think that she was competing in every song . She is totally immersed and on everyone s side . \" ( Even when her husband , John Legend , takes on Common in April 2 s second episode ? ) 7 . Who determines the winner ? The audience in the room . Jimmy s brand of comedy is so pure , and that s exactly the tone of the show . So we did n t overcomplicate it with levels , and gameplay , and points . It s just pure entertainment , top to bottom , Patterson says . 8 . Is the prize just bragging rights ? No . Each winner also gets this belt . Lip Sync Battle premieres April 2 , with back-to-back episodes starting at 10 p.m. , on Spike TV .",

		"paragraph": "A four-night miniseries about the gay rights movement as well as the women s movement , and the civil rights movement When We Rise carves out a huge chunk of history to dramatize . The four-night , eight-hour miniseries starts Monday on ABC . It was created by Dustin Lance Black , who won an Oscar in 2008 for his screenplay for Milk , the biopic about the assassination of gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk ( played by Sean Penn ) . The new miniseries is constructed around a diverse group of real LGBT activists , primarily Cleve Jones ( Guy Pearce ) , Ken Jones ( Michael Kenneth Williams ) , and Roma Guy ( Mary-Louise Parker ) . The production frequently contrasts actors with footage of real news coverage of the rights struggle . It will probably surprise a chunk of the When We Rise viewership to see how commonly antigay sentiments were aired as a viable position in the mainstream media . Any historical saga that is set to the beat of Sylvester s ( You Make Me Feel ) Mighty Real and Donna Summer s Bad Girls is A-OK with me , and a lot of When We Rise , which begins in the early 1970s , is exhilarating stuff . Black gets down to the nitty-gritty , as we used to say in the 70s , with lots of well-detailed scenes of how a loose coalition of angry , exploited , frightened , shrewd , political , and apolitical people formed patchwork groups that held small meetings , fought with other groups over philosophy and methods , and eventually united to create a movement that changed the social fabric of America . Along the way , Whoopi Goldberg , Rosie O Donnell , David Hyde Pierce , and other familiar faces pop up as history-based characters who agitate for or against that movement , depending on their point of view . The script moves from big , macro issues how various groups organized , protested , drafted legislation to personal stories of individuals discovering their true sexuality , coming out to their parents , facing down discrimination and worse . When We Rise also regularly succumbs to some of the pitfalls of agitprop , most notably dialogue that sounds less like conversational speech and more like stiff sloganeering . It s time to fight back ! All of you combined are stronger than you know ! We ll fight for your right to be a mother ! If straight America does n t find out they know at least one of us , then they might vote against us ! Black has not avoided comparisons of When We Rise to Roots , the 1977 miniseries about the history of American slavery , and his project is no less ambitious . But Roots , as powerful as it was in its visual depictions of the slave trade , was also marred by a melodramatic style that makes some parts of it now seem quaint and obvious . Rise shares some of these flaws . It would have helped , perhaps , if the production was n t so drawn out , but rather condensed to a tightly assembled , one-night TV movie . But at its best , When We Rise achieves the inspirational status it desires , and goes beyond that to portray the romanticism of rebellion as an exhilarating , desirable goal . Arriving at a time when so much of the country is primed for its own organized protests , When We Rise offers valuable models for resistance in the present day . When We Rise airs Monday , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday at 9 p.m. on ABC .

		"paragraph": "Knees bent and spread apart . Feet positioned at a half-diamond just beyond my behind . Torso resting between my thighs . Head resting gently on the mat . Arms stretched out in front of me . Inhale , exhale , and breathe . And breathe . And breathe . And â€¦ cry . And pause to wipe the tears from my face . Pause to look around to make sure no one else saw my silent tears that felt so loud . Pause to feel ashamed . Pause to feel the anchor of grief holding a grip on me like a weight never to be unmoved . The yoga class I took in mid-October went a little like this . A close friend of mine , a friend I met my first semester in graduate school seven years ago , was killed at the end of August in a car accident . When I learned the news of her death , I was out of the country and thousands of miles away from home . Crying through yoga was a sloppy attempt to do something , something other than stumbling through my life as a zombie as I coped with the loss of such a good friend . I stopped working and awkwardly informed editors I could n t finish pieces . I let texts and most one-on-one contact on social media pile up and go unanswered . Anxiety characterized most of my interpersonal bonds with others . I experienced either a subtle pressure to be my same self despite grieving or my grief being too overwhelming for others to interact with or acknowledge . I oscillated between disappointment and frustration with most people because of it . I was tired all the time , numb even . I drank a ton of red wine and had sore throats due to dehydration the morning after . Although I peg myself as a crier , I did n t cry . I stared into space as my body ached . A friend had a suggestion : yoga . She suggested I try slower , more meditative yoga classes , different from the faster-paced vinyasa classes I d taken before and detested . Her outlook was that yoga could be a way to nurture and care for myself during a difficult time . I signed up for restorative and yin yoga classes after purchasing a monthly pass for new students at a nearby studio . All I had deep within the throes of early grief was the mat . The experience of yoga . The motion of returning to the mat , returning to myself , being still in an audience of one . Deep breaths , a stray tear falling if it may . Ironically , it s all I have now , too , as the days turn to weeks and the weeks into months , as the time lengthens since I last saw my friend alive and full of life . On the last night I saw her , we danced , and drank , and laughed until we could n t anymore . She was my plus-one to a silent disco on a hot , sticky night in July . The type of sultry , Southern summer night where the heat hangs heavy . We made a late-night run to Burger King she ordered a veggie burger because she was a pescatarian and me a Whopper because I was ravenous . Her boyfriend was our chauffeur and shook his head with a smirk as we laughed and joked . Yoga has n t healed me . It has not been a magical pill . It has not given me a warm and fuzzy answer to how I am whole again after arguably one of the worst situations to befall my spirit . It has n t stopped there from being moments where the sheer magnitude of the loss of such a close friend hits me with a deep thud in my chest . Where my breath leaves my body for a few seconds as I ponder the disbelief of something thoroughly illogical . My budding yoga practice as I fumble through the poses , as I roll my mat into a cylinder at the end of each session and whisper of namaste signals another day building toward something . Building toward a new form of self-awareness . Awareness of my place in this world deserving of giving the same love I freely give to others to myself . Awareness of the depth of my love for my friend . I am surprised as I continue to mine undiscovered layers of how deeply she was loved and etched into this gargantuan heart of mine . Yoga is my safe space where I can grieve with no audience . Where my grief is n t too complicated or uncomfortable for others . Where it is n t too complicated or uncomfortable for me . A safe space to gaze at my grief , to hold it near and dear . Or to find a way to delicately move forward , with myself intact .

Now he s winning some of the best reviews of his career for a role he did n t initially want : Winston Churchill . In the new film Darkest Hour , Oldman vanishes into the face and form of England s former Prime Minister , who led the island nation through the dark days of World War II . His performance has impressive film festival audiences from Telluride to Toronto and makes him an early favorite in this year s Oscar race for Best Actor a statue he s only been in contention for once before for his star turn in the 2011 John le Carr adaptation , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy . In the latest trailer for Darkest Hour ( watch above ) , Oldman completely disappears into the character , who must rally Britain in the face of monumental odds . A companion piece , of sorts , to Christopher Nolan s summertime box-office hit Dunkirk , Darkest Hour depicts what was happening in London s halls of power as British faced destruction on the beaches of France . Having assumed the office after Neville Chamberlin s resignation , Churchill faced the monumental choice of continuing to fight the emboldened Axis forces or negotiate a peace treaty that would leave England out of the war that was consuming continental Europe . Where Dunkirk was more of an ensemble piece , Darkest Hour director Joe Wright and writer Anthony McCarten are well aware that Oldman s performance is the movie s best special effect .

		"paragraph": "Jim Brockmire gifted baseball announcer , dissolute rake , high-functioning alcoholic is trying to regain his career after a very public meltdown he had a decade ago . That s the premise of the new half-hour Brockmire , a sitcom with underpinnings of drama premiering tonight on IFC . It stars Hank Azaria as Brockmire the character is an extension of one he first created in a Funny or Die video and Amanda Peet as the woman who gives him a second chance . Brockmire , far from the major leagues , has come to Morristown , Pa. , where Peet s Jules has hired him to be the announcer for her hometown minor-league baseball team , the Frackers . Brockmire has spent most of the past decade abroad , trying to escape from the drunken scandal that cost him his prominence . Arriving in Morristown , he ca n t believe how small-time his career has become : The Frackers are mediocre , and there are days when their frowsy stadium is dotted with a mere dozen fans . This is the setup for a real downer , but Brockmire avoids that , thanks to Azaria s marvelously aggressive yet subtle performance , and the spark that Peet provides as a bristlingly independent woman , allowing Jules to become a collaborator in Brockmire s fitful redemption . The show is uneven . When Brockmire is in the broadcast booth , Azaria s arias of baseball lore are mesmerizing and witty , but the show also relies too frequently on jokes about Brockmire leaving the microphone open during embarrassing moments there are too many shots of fans in shock at overhearing naughty things . Brockmire gives its two leads showcases they ve more than earned . Azaria is best known for his voice work on The Simpsons , but his turn as the corrupt FBI agent Ed Cochran on Ray Donovan reminded us just how good an actor he is . Here , he wears Brockmire s loud houndstooth jacket lightly , never overdoing the man s quirks and foibles . Peet is someone who has long deserved a worthy TV vehicle . She had it in HBO s Togetherness , which was canceled too soon , and she held together lesser projects such as the sitcom Bent ( her co-star in that show , David Walton , appears in an amusing role on Brockmire ) and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . Here , the character of Jules allows Peet to show those qualities that make her such a compelling screen presence a combination of braininess and wit , a willingness to be both vulnerable and silly . Brockmire has already been renewed for a second season it has plenty of time to get even better than it already is . Brockmire airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on IFC .

		"paragraph": "If you missed the first seven minutes of Thursday 's contest between the Portland Trail Blazers and Charlotte Bobcats , you missed the competitive portion of Thursday 's contest between the Portland Trail Blazers and Charlotte Bobcats . Terry Stotts ' team entered its matchup with Charlotte 's top-flight defense ( No. 6 in the league in points allowed per possession ) riding high after a stirring come-from-behind road win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on New Year 's Eve , and promptly buried Steve Clifford 's squad beneath a barrage of baskets that rendered matters all over but the shoutin ' pretty darn quick . Portland made 11 of its first 13 shots , including six straight 3-pointers , to take a 28-13 lead with 4:53 remaining in the opening period . The Bobcats were down 20 before the game was 10 minutes old and never got closer than 12 for the entire rest of the game , as the Blazers shot a scorching 58.1 percent from the floor en route to a 134-104 win that saw Portland make 21 of 33 3-point shots ... and you can watch each and every one of them right here : The long-distance barrage marked the second time this season that Portland has made more than 20 3-pointers in a game , with the first coming in a blowout win over the Philadelphia 76ers back on Dec. 14 . And that earns Stotts ' Blazers a place in the history books , because no other team has ever had more than one 20-plus performance in a single season . ( According to Basketball-Reference.com , there have only been 14 such performances since the 1985-86 season , with five coming in the last calendar year ... and two coming by the Blazers . ) After the game , Stotts let the Blazers ' clicking-on-all-cylinders offense No. 1 in the NBA in offensive efficiency ( 110.4 points per 100 possessions ) and in 3-point field goal percentage ( 40.5 percent ) speak for itself , according to Kerry Eggers of the Portland Tribune : And yet , there 's an argument to be made that the Blazers ' sweet string music was n't the coolest thing to come out of the Blazers ' league-leading 26th win , because we also learned that this is something that happens now : That Twitter handle belongs to Blazers reserve big man Thomas Robinson , who confirmed that he was , indeed , yelling \" lunchmeat \" every time All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldridge got the ball against the Bobcats ' overmatched McRoberts . Thankfully , intrepid reporter Ben Golliver of Blazersedge followed up after the game to confirm and expand : That 's probably a good idea , LaMarcus . Unless , of course , you say it like this : If you do it like that , even the defender will probably think it 's pretty chill . Just an idea . Aldridge was actually one just four Blazers ( along with reserve big man Joel Freeland , wing Dorell Wright and rookie guard Allen Crabbe ) to make less than half his field goals on Thursday , finishing with 10 points on 5 for 13 shooting as Charlotte did its level best to stop Portland 's dominant post presence . He did , however , finish with 15 rebounds and three assists , including two that led directly to 3-pointers . Even when he was n't kicking out to a shooter , though , all the extra attention Aldridge demanded on the block tilted the floor in ways that forced Charlotte into long rotations , which the Blazers picked apart with its now-signature extra-pass ball movement to find open marksmen virtually everywhere they looked . The final tally : 34 assists on 54 made field goals , with 17 of the 21 made triples set up directly by a pass . The lesson , it seems ?

Today brings work from Berkeley , where a team is working on a water-harvesting apparatus that requires no power and can produce water even in the dry air of the desert . Hey , if a cactus can do it , why ca n't we ? While there are numerous methods for collecting water from the air , many require power or parts that need to be replaced what professor Omar Yaghi has developed needs neither . The secret is n't some clever solar concentrator or low-friction fan it 's all about the materials . Yaghi is a chemist , and has created what 's called a metal-organic framework , or MOF , that 's eager both to absorb and release water . It 's essentially a powder made of tiny crystals in which water molecules get caught as the temperature decreases . Then , when the temperature increases again , the water is released into the air again . Yaghi demonstrated the process on a small scale last year , but now he and his team have published the results of a larger field test producing real-world amounts of water . They put together a box about two feet per side with a layer of MOF on top that sits exposed to the air . Every night the temperature drops and the humidity rises , and water is trapped inside the MOF in the morning , the sun 's heat drives the water from the powder , and it condenses on the box 's sides , kept cool by a sort of hat . The result of a night 's work : 3 ounces of water per pound of MOF used . That 's not much more than a few sips , but improvements are already on the way . Currently the MOF uses zicronium , but an aluminum-based MOF , already being tested in the lab , will cost 99 percent less and produce twice as much water . With the new powder and a handful of boxes , a person 's drinking needs are met without using any power or consumable material . Add a mechanism that harvests and stores the water and you 've got yourself an off-grid potable water solution . \" There is nothing like this , \" Yaghi explained in a Berkeley news release . \" It operates at ambient temperature with ambient sunlight , and with no additional energy input you can collect water in the desert . The aluminum MOF is making this practical for water production , because it is cheap . \" He says there are already commercial products in development . More tests , with mechanical improvements and including the new MOF , are planned for the hottest months of the summer .",

		"paragraph": "Ever since the Friday morning on which Arsene Wenger announced his Arsenal resignation , Jose Mourinho promised that he and Manchester United would show the managerial legend the respect he deserves . And on Sunday , before Wenger s final game at Old Trafford as Arsenal boss , Mourinho and the club followed through on their promise . When Wenger stepped out of the visitors dugout minutes before kickoff , he was greeted by a thorough , warm round of applause from Manchester United fans . He was also greeted by two of his biggest touchline rivals throughout his 22 years at Arsenal : Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson . Mourinho shook Wenger s hand , and led him pitchside , the two almost arm in arm . There waiting for Wenger was Ferguson who retired in 2013 with a gift for the Gunners boss . Wenger opened the box to reveal a fancy vase , and held it aloft as Old Trafford saluted him : Both Mourinho and Ferguson had their arguments and differences with Wenger over the years . They were fierce on-field adversaries , with Wenger succeeding against Ferguson in the early years , but both Mourinho and Ferguson getting the better of Wenger over the latter half of his Arsenal reign . Competition did n t impede respect , though . I am sure Manchester United fans will remember all the years when Arsenal were their biggest rivals , and I am going to remember Arsene as a big opponent , the manager of the Invincibles , Mourinho said before Sunday s match . That was my first year in this country . When I arrived in 2004 , Arsenal had just won the title without being beaten . I would say the Invincibles made me a better coach and that is the way I will remember Arsene . Ferguson spoke about Wenger on the day of the original announcement : Both Mourinho and Ferguson also recognize what Wenger has done for the Premier League , and for English football as a whole . So do Manchester United fans . And they made sure Wenger felt their appreciation . During the game , those fans reverted to teasing the Arsenal manager .

		"paragraph": "( NEW YORK ) Peter Fonda apologized Wednesday for a late-night Twitter rant in which he suggested 12-year-old Barron Trump should be ripped from his mother s arms and put in a cage with pedophiles . The all-capitals tweet in the wee hours went on to call President Donald Trump an expletive . The actor later deleted the tweet and drew sharp rebukes from first lady Melania Trump and Donald Trump Jr . The two-time Oscar nominee , brother of Jane Fonda and son of Hollywood legend Henry Fonda said in a statement hours later that he was upset over children separated from their parents on the U.S.-Mexico border . I tweeted something highly inappropriate and vulgar about the president and his family in response to the devastating images I was seeing on television , Fonda said in the statement , released by both his manager and his publicist . Like many Americans , I am very impassioned and distraught over the situation with children separated from their families at the border , but I went way too far . It was wrong and I should not have done it . I immediately regretted it and sincerely apologize to the family for what I said and any hurt my words have caused . In another tweet , Fonda suggested people opposed to the border policy should track down the addresses of federal agents and surround their homes in protest , adding : We should find out what schools their children go to and surround the schools in protest . Stephanie Grisham , the first lady s spokeswoman , said via email regarding the Barron remarks : The tweet is sick and irresponsible . She said the U.S. Secret Service was notified . A spokesman for the agency said via email the Secret Service is aware of Fonda s tweets but as a matter of practice would have no additional comment . Donald Trump Jr. , meanwhile , did some tweeting of his own , addressing Fonda : You re clearly a sick individual who behaved like a bully and a coward . ",

		"paragraph": "The opening weekend of Incredibles 2 was , well , incredible . The Disney-Pixar movie flew to a record-breaking launch of $ 180 million in 4,410 locations , easily landing the superhero sequel the best debut of all time for an animated film . That title was previously held by fellow Pixar sequel Finding Dory , which bowed with $ 135 million in 2016 . Incredibles 2 also landed the eighth-biggest domestic opening of all time , and surpassed 2017 s Beauty and the Beast ( $ 174.6 million ) for the best debut for a PG-rated film . Overseas , where it has opened in 26 % of the international market , Pixar s 20th film collected $ 51.5 million , bringing its global total to $ 231.5 million . With 14 years since the original film , 2004 s The Incredibles , enthusiasm has been strong for the follow-up , and it seems that audiences and critics alike were not disappointed . The film boasts a coveted A + CinemaScore , as well as a 94 % Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes . The film shows the drawing power of the superhero genre , whether in the live action or animated realm , box office analyst Paul Dergarbedian said . The combination of the Pixar brand and Disney s perfectly executed marketing and distribution strategy made the film an instant classic and a box office juggernaut . Disney s head of distribution , Cathleen Taff , attributes the massive opening to pent up demand for another Incredibles film , along with positive word of mouth . It also helps that it s been a while since a family film has hit multiplexes , she added . We re so thrilled , Taff said . Brad and team put together a great film that delivers something for everybody . It was the perfect storm . Watch trailers , movies and more on Yahoo View . Incredibles 2 picks up directly following the events of the original film with the Parr family members attempting to balance having a normal life with their superpowers . Holly Hunter , Craig T. Nelson , Sarah Vowell , and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their voice roles , while Bob Odenkirk , Catherine Keener , and Sophia Bush voice new characters . Brad Bird returned to write and direct the sequel . Incredibles 2 should set Disney back on track after Solo : A Star Wars Story disappointed earlier this summer . The expensive Star Wars film has had difficulty gaining traction at the box office since launching with $ 103 million over a four day weekend . Though every previous Disney-released Star Wars adventure has managed to fly past the $ 1 billion mark , Solo is struggling to cross $ 400 million . Disney does n t exactly need to break a sweat , however . Incredibles 2 scored the third biggest opening of 2018 , meaning the three best debuts of 2018 all belong to the Magic Kingdom . Disney-Marvel titles Black Panther ( $ 257.7 million ) and Avengers : Infinity War ( $ 202 million ) secured the No. 1 and 2 spots . Also opening this weekend was Warner Bros. and New Line s Tag , which targeted a debut of $ 14.6 million in 3,382 theaters . The R-rated comedy starring Ed Helms , Jake Johnson , Jon Hamm , and Jeremy Renner is based on a Wall Street Journal profile about a group of grown men who play a longstanding game of tag . Though the film was aimed at male moviegoers , the audience breakdown was surprisingly 51 % female . Those over the age of 25 accounted for 78 % of audiences , while 58 % were under 35 years old . Attendees seem satisfied , giving the film a B + CinemaScore and 74 % audience score on Rotten Tomatoes . New Line s latest title , Game Night , opened earlier this year with with $ 17 million a solid start given the film s $ 16 million price tag . As of this week , the Jason Bateman/Rachel McAdams dark comedy has pocketed $ 117 million globally , including $ 69 million domestically . The final wide release , Superfly , got a head start by opening on Wednesday . Sony s remake of 1972 blaxploitation classic Super Fly pocketed $ 8.4 million in 2,220 locations during the five-day period . Well-known music video helmer Director X took the reigns on the $ 16 million project , which only began production in January and finished in time for its June release . The film features all new songs written by rapper Future , who co-produced along with Joel Silver . Superfly stars Trevor Jackson , Jason Mitchell , Michael Kenneth Williams , Lex Scott Davis , and Jennifer Morrison . The original 1972 Super Fly , starring Ron O Neal and directed by Gordon Parks , was hugely profitable at the box office with a $ 30 million gross from a $ 500,000 budget . While the film became a cult hit , its soundtrack composed by R&B legend Curtis Mayfield became even more popular and ultimately outgrossed Super Fly s box office earnings . Ocean s 8 managed to steal the No. 2 spot in its sophomore frame , picking up another $ 19.5 million in 4,145 locations . The female-fronted heist spinoff had a series-best opening last weekend with $ 41.5 million . Its domestic tally currently sits at $ 79 million . In fourth is Solo : A Star Wars Story with $ 9.3 million on 3,182 screens . In four weeks , the tentpole has made $ 193 million at the domestic box office . Rounding out the top five is another superhero sequel , Deadpool 2 , which scored $ 8.6 million in its fifth outing . To date , 21st Century Fox s blockbuster starring Ryan Reynolds has amassed $ 294.5 million domestically . At the specialty box office , Gotti earned $ 1.6 million in 503 locations . John Travolta and Kelly Preston star in the mobster movie , directed by Entourage star Kevin Connolly . The film , which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival , was originally intended to be released by Lionsgate in 2017 , but the studio sold it back to its producers two weeks before . Vertical Entertainment and Sunrider Productions are now co-distributing along with movie ticketing service MoviePass Ventures . Meanwhile , Ruth Bader Ginsburg s documentary is having a heroic moment of its own . Magnolia and Participant Media s RBG crossed the $ 10 million mark in just seven weeks . Finally , Morgan Nevill s Mister Rogers documentary Wo n t You Be My Neighbor brought in $ 985,000 when it expanded to 96 theaters . The biopic , which holds an impressive 99 % fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes , has picked up $ 1.7 million in two weeks . Next week , it will expand to over 300 theaters .

The company , hurt in the past month by Musk 's high-profile U-turn on a deal to take it private , said Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton had resigned , citing discomfort with the level of public attention and pace of work . That followed a twitter storm overnight about Musk smoking marijuana and drinking whisky in a 2-1/2 - hour live web show with comedian Joe Rogan . Bloomberg also reported Tesla 's Chief People Officer Gaby Toledano was to leave the company just over a year after joining . Tesla was not immediately available for comment . Some Wall Street analysts called again for the company to appoint another senior leader for the company to take the pressure off Musk , or rein in his control . \" We have been calling for a Co-CEO or COO to assist to codifying the leadership structure and in so doing , the culture at Tesla , \" said James Albertine , an analyst at brokerage Consumer Edge . \" We think this is further evidence that the time is now for management and the Board to address these issues . \" Tesla shares , down just 1 percent after Musk 's appearance on the Rogan podcast , fell another 7 percent in the half hour after the Morton 's resignation . They were down 8 percent by 9.13 et . \" I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla , its mission , and its future prospects , and I have no disagreements with Tesla s leadership or its financial reporting , \" the company quoted Morton as saying in a filing .

		"paragraph": "Perhaps President Trump is right , and it s not about collusion at all . But that does n t mean he has nothing to worry about . Special prosecutor Robert Mueller notched a prominent win on Tuesday with a guilty verdict on eight of 18 charges in the trial of Paul Manafort , who was Trump s campaign manager for five months during the 2016 presidential election . While the jury deadlocked on 10 counts , it found Manafort guilty of five tax-evasion charges , two bank-fraud charges , and one charge of failing to register a foreign bank account . Jail time could total as much as 80 years . Trump must wonder whether his business dealings could survive the type of forensic analysis Mueller s team was able to perform on Manafort s operation . Prosecutors in the Manafort trial did n t focus at all on Russia , even though it is Mueller s mandate to explore all links between Russia and the 2016 U.S. presidential election . Instead , Mueller focused on crimes unearthed while investigating Russian interference , which the special prosecutor is entitled to do . Manafort earned as much as $ 65 million as a consultant for foreign politicians from 2006 to 2015 , parking most of the money in overseas accounts to avoid paying U.S. taxes on it . He never registered as a foreign lobbyist even though he represented foreign interests in Washington . And when Manafort s foreign income began to run dry in 2014 , he obtained millions of dollars in loans by misleading banks about his assets and finances while also holding out the prospect of plum jobs in the Trump administration in exchange for favorable treatment from lenders . Trump never operated as a foreign consultant , and there s no reason to think he shielded foreign income in offshore accounts the way Manafort did . But other aspects of the Manafort investigation get closer to the type of business Trump did as chairman of the Trump Organization . As a real-estate developer with projects in at least a dozen countries , Trump had business relationships with a variety of Russians involving millions of dollars worth of deals at a minimum . And now that Mueller is cracking open private business arrangements that were once hidden from public view , Trump may fear that his own business secrets are vulnerable , too . Recall that in July 2017 , the New York Times asked President Trump : If Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances , unrelated to Russia is that a red line ? Trump responded : I would say yeah . I would say yes . By the way , â€¦ I sell a lot of condo units , and somebody from Russia buys a condo , who knows ? I do n t make money from Russia . For starters , there s the Florida estate Trump bought out of bankruptcy in 2004 for $ 41 million and resold four years later to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for $ 95 million . It s possible Trump improved the property enough to justify the 132 % markup , or sold at the peak of a real-estate bubble to a buyer who overpaid . But it s also possible there s more to the story and the Russian oligarch got something else from Trump , in addition to a moldy , oceanfront spread . [ See the risk for Trump in Michael Cohen s guilty plea . ] For years Trump wanted to build one of his signature , namesake towers in Moscow . By 2014 , he was getting close , having made contacts with a variety of Russians who might help gain government approvals and provide financing . The prospect of Trump Tower Moscow died when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine . Europe and the United States responded by imposing sanctions in 2014 , which made Trump s project impossible . Still , those Russian contacts may have helped Trump finance other deals and funneled Russian buyers to key Trump properties . In the Manafort case , prosecutors detailed the way Trump s former campaign manager used various properties to launder tax-free earnings from accounts in Cyprus , the Grenadines , and other offshore locations . Trump s business is different from Manafort s consulting operation , but there s one commonality : real estate , which is a well-known way to launder ill-gotten money . There are several known connections between Trump the developer and Russian interests that involved financial transactions . After a spate of business bankruptcies , Trump had trouble getting loans from conventional banks . But a shady Russian-born businessman named Felix Sater has helped Trump get financing for a number of projects . Then there s Aras Agalarov , a Moscow construction billionaire close to Russian president Vladimir Putin , who has described himself as a friend and business associate of Trump . And as early as 2008 , Trump s son Donald , Jr. described the Trump Organization s connection to Russian interests this way : Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets . . . . We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia . There s nothing wrong or illegal about doing business with Russians ( or with most foreign interests ) . But there would be a problem if Trump got sweetheart deals on unconventional loans emanating from Russia because Russia s financial sector is essentially controlled by Putin . And that could help explain Trump s apparent soft spot for a dictator most national security experts consider a threat to the United States . Much of the coverage of Mueller s investigation into Trump s Russian connections has focused on meetings between Trump officials and Russians during the campaign . But Mueller is almost certainly digging much deeper than that . If you want to understand what happened at these meetings , you have to understand these business relationships , Yahoo News Michael Isikoff , author of a new book on the Trump-Russia connection , told Yahoo Finance earlier this year . The Trump Organization was a privately owned company that did n t have to report financial information publicly . And Trump , of course , has never released his tax returns . So there s very little public information available to analyze Trump s financial connections or those of his company . That wo n t stop Mueller , who has subpoena power . In the Manafort case , Mueller s team tracked financial transactions among a web of companies including 17 domestic entities , 13 based in Cyprus , two based in the Grenadines , and one based in the United Kingdom . The indictment alone itemized more than 200 transactions , with dollar amounts , in which Manafort wired money from overseas accounts to American vendors providing Manafort things such as clothing , antique rugs , landscaping services , antiques , and automobiles . Mueller s team had some key inside assistance : Rick Gates , Manafort s former right-hand man , who turned on his former boss and detailed how Manafort committed his crimes in exchange for favorable sentencing for his own crimes . Trump now faces a similar turncoat in Michael Cohen , his former lawyer and fixer , who pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges on the same afternoon that the Manafort jury delivered its guilty verdicts . Six of those charges did n t involve Trump , but two involved hush-money payments Cohen says were directed by Trump in the late days of the 2016 campaign . Prosecutors could get other information damaging to Trump from Cohen . It does n t have to be collusion to cause Trump enormous problems and perhaps even threaten his presidency .

		"paragraph": "Cristiano Ronaldo has been left out of the Portuguese national team 's upcoming matches after a former model accused him of rape . Kathryn Mayorga , a 34-year-old former model , has claimed the famous footballer assaulted her in Las Vegas in 2009 . Ronaldo , 33 , has angrily denied Ms Mayorga 's claims , and hit out at \" people seeking to promote themselves at my expense \" . Portugal 's decision to drop its captain from its next two games came after police in Las Vegas announced they were re-opening their investigation into Ms Mayorga 's claims . The footballer has said he is keen to clear his name but added his \" clear conscience \" allows him to calmly await \" the results of any and all investigations \" . Ronaldo will miss Portugal s second game in the UEFA Nations League in Poland next Thursday and a friendly match in Glasgow against Scotland three days later . Fernando Santos , Portugal 's coach , said Ronaldo will also not be called up for the next round of international games in November . Mr Santos said the decision was taken after a discussion between himself , Ronaldo and the head of the Portuguese soccer federation . We agreed the player would n t be available , would n t be an option for selection , Mr Santos said . For the next two squad selections , this one and the one next month , Ronaldo wo n t be with us . He added he expected Ronaldo , who with 154 caps is his country 's most experienced player , will return to playing for Portugal eventually . Ronaldo has already missed Portugal 's first two post-World Cup games as he completed an 88.7 m move to Italian club Juventus . He was spotted arriving at the club 's practice session Thursday . Mr Mayorga has filed a lawsuit against Ronaldo seeking to void a $ 375,000 non-disclosure agreement she alleges she was coerced into signing . She claims the footballer raped her in a Last Vegas hotel penthouse suite in June 2009 and is now seeking more than $ 200,000 in damages . The player has vehemently denied the accusation , saying \" rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in \" . The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had responded to a call alleging a sexual assault on June 13 , 2009 and confirmed it has now reopened the case . In a statement to The Telegraph , the police department stated : \" The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department responded to a call of a sexual assault on June 13 , 2009 . \" At the time the report was taken , the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description . A medical exam was conducted . \" As of September 2018 , the case has been reopened and our detectives are following up on information being provided by the victim . \" Police have refused to say whether the footballer is the subject of an investigation .",

		"paragraph": "Donald Trump has said asylum seekers who illegally cross into the US from Mexico will be kept in very nice tents in a bid to put others off doing the same . Railing against a migrant caravan heading for America s southern border , the US president told Fox News his administration is going to build tent cities in preparation for what he described as an invasion of the country . Those applying to stay in the US will be incarcerated until their asylum application is considered by a court , Mr Trump added a process which can currently take years . Mr Trump s comments on Monday evening came the same day it emerged he is preparing to send more than 5,000 troops to the Mexico border , a move critics say is an attempt to further politicise the issue . I m sending up the military , this is the military , and they re standing there , and one thing that will happen , when they re captured , we do n t let them out , Mr Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham . What has been happening , and we re not as of pretty recently , we re not letting them out . What happens is they would catch and release , he added , in reference to a policy which allows people entering the US illegally to live there ahead of their court date . We re catching , we re not releasing . So if they wan na come over , but we re not even doing that . We re not letting them into this country . He continued : We re going to build tent cities , we re going to put tents up all over the place . We re not going to build structures , and spend all of this , you know , hundreds of millions of dollars . We re going to have tents , they re going to be very nice , and they re going to wait , and if they do n t get asylum , they get out . And very few people , they do n t actually , if you wan na wait they do n t usually get asylum , you know that . The result , Mr Trump added , would be far fewer people attempting to cross into the US . Asked if sending troops to the border was an midterm election strategy to fire up his base , Mr Trump insisted the thousands attempting to reach the US was an invasion of our country , a phrase he had previously used on Twitter . Later in the interview , Mr Trump railed against accusations he bears some responsibility for the attempted mail bombing of CNN s offices and a number of high-profile critics of the president . Despite his inflammatory rhetoric , including repeatedly branding fake news media the enemy of the people , Mr Trump insisted responsibility lay only with the insane suspect , who is an avowed supporter of the president . Complaining his name was in the headline of one news report about the arrest of the suspect , Cesar Sayoc , Mr Trump compared the coverage to news reports about the shooting of nine African-Americans by a white supremacist in 2015 . They did n t do that with President Obama with the church , the horrible situation with the church , they did n t do that , he said .",

		"paragraph": "After the slightly awkward interview David Letterman did with Jay-Z last month , the white-bearded host gets back on track with a far cozier Tina Fey interview on a new edition of his Netflix show , My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman . Letterman and Fey have an easy rapport that loosens up both of them : They re fun to watch , riffing off each other . Fey asks , Do you want to hear my Trump story ? and indeed we do . She also says she s glad she s not working at Saturday Night Live now because of the poisonous atmosphere Donald Trump has let loose in the land . It s a hard time : The level of outrage is so high , it feels like talking to anyone , anywhere , in 2018 is just land mine hopscotch . Letterman asks her the kind of question most interviewees would dismiss as unfair pick the eight best Saturday Night Live cast members to do a sketch with and Fey gives him a serious , thoughtful answer . Fey also admits to a mistake she made in executing one of her most famous SNL sketches , issuing a surprise apology . The interview is timed as a promotion : Fey s Broadway musical version of Mean Girls has just opened , and Letterman gives her plenty of time to plug it . But one purpose of these hourlong interviews is to go over the entire career of the guest , so we also hear about Fey s youth and her early performing days in Chicago s Second City improv group . This leads to a slight detour into Chicago food , which leads to the odd moment that occurs in all of these Netflix Letterman shows : the cutaway from the interview to a taped segment . This one finds Letterman eating chicken in a Chicago restaurant with blues guitarist Buddy Guy . No , it has nothing to do with Fey . Anyway , when Letterman asks her to pick eight SNL players she would like to do a sketch with , her choices span the history of the show . I m not going to spoil her list , but I will say that she says she s scared of Bill Murray : I feel like he can just smell how uncool I am . In the most revealing and intimate moment of this interview , Letterman brings up her viral sheet cake moment on SNL this past August , when Fey addressed the racist demonstrations that occurred in Charlottesville , Va . You may recall that Fey s commentary was both widely admired and widely criticized . With Letterman , Fey says , Here s what s wrong with it and acknowledges that the skit could have been interpreted as loftily privileged . Or in her words : I chunked it . The implication was that I was telling people to give up and not be active and to not fight , says Fey . That was not my intention , obviously , but she owns it , albeit with some justifiable defensiveness : But at some point , I have decided that the culture of apology is not for me , so I promise , I swear to God , anyone who is mad at me , I hear you , and I will keep learning , but I m also not gon na stop trying . She also reveals the line she would insert into the sketch , if I had a time machine , if I could insert one sentence digitally . Again , I wo n t spoil this check out the interview .

		"paragraph": "Warning : The following contains spoilers for Sunday s Big Little Lies finale . Big Little Lies is Nicole Kidman â€˜ s first experience starring in a weekly TV series and she s enjoying every minute of it . I just love being in people s lives every week , she tells TVLine , adding that the murder-mystery aspect of the HBO miniseries requires a lot of discussion and people asking questions and analyzing things . I find that very , very stimulating . I m just amazed at the way people must watch things . Because they re-watch it , and they seem to really notice detail . Far more than film . They can press rewind ! RELATEDBig Little Lies Finale Recap : Do n t Be Cruel Plus : Grade It ! And Emmy voters are going to want to press rewind on Kidman s haunting performance as battered wife Celeste . We talked with the Oscar-winning actress at length about Sunday s riveting finale which saw Celeste s abusive husband Perry killed after a brutal tussle the painfully intimate scenes between Celeste and her therapist , how her famous husband Keith Urban reacted to the miniseries â€¦ and if there s any chance we might see Celeste and company again in a second season . TVLINE | Fans had so many theories about how the show would end . Did the ending surprise you ? Had you read the book ? Yes , I knew the book . But the way in which [ director ] Jean-Marc [ Vall e ] captured all of us â€¦ I think the final scene , where you have the beach and the children and all of us together , and the strength from that point on , the way in which we re going to protect each other â€¦ I just think that was so important for the whole arc of the series . Because this is Reese [ Witherspoon ] and I going , We want to make a series that celebrates women , not that brings us down . And if you see the whole series , that s what you see , ultimately . It s about the friendships â€¦ no matter what has happened and the paths that have led us to where we are , when it really becomes important , we reach out for each other . TVLINE | That s what I loved about that final scene : These women sniped at each other and fought throughout the series , but when something really serious happened , they all came together and joined forces . Mmm-hmmm , yeah . I always say that the conflicts in the show â€¦ Laura [ Dern ] s character had to defend herself and have her shield and her armor because of her desire to fit in . She s hugely successful , but still , for her , she feels like an outsider . I think many women feel like that . And then for someone like Celeste , there s so much tragedy there , and so many things she ca n t say to people , because that would be absolutely destroying and betraying what she sees as her family . And having to face the truth of that is almost impossible , you know ? Until , as you see in the finale , she finds out that how she thinks she s protecting her children is actually destroying them . And I love that she goes to her little boy and holds him . She does n t punish him . She just holds him and tells him , I m gon na work through this with you , and I m your mother , and it s going to be alright . So she s breaking the pattern . That shows Celeste s deep , deep love for her children , and the desire to do the right thing . She s absorbed so much in terms of what she thought was best for the family , and actually , when she faces the truth , it was n t . She was willing to do that , to sabotage herself and take on the pain , because she thinks she s giving her children a good life . So it s very complicated . That s rare to see that , I think . RELATEDBig Little Lies : Alexander Skarsgard Talks Finale Twist , Stealth Spoiler TVLINE | Yeah , you do n t see that a lot : the complexity of Celeste s situation , and how you can see how she justifies in her mind staying for as long as she has . It was really important to me that â€¦ you would feel the desire to sort of go , Celeste , please ! Shake her , you know . But at the same time , understand her and feel for her . Because so many women are in this situation , and I wanted there to be compassion for her , rather than judgment and anger . She s doing that to herself , because she s the type of person to hold it all in anyway . TVLINE | But when she sees how that violence has been passed down to Max , that s the last straw for her , right ? Right , because she thinks it s not , and defends it always with the therapist . She says , No , absolutely not . They never see it . She defends a lot of things , and puts on a smile about a lot of things . From the way in which it was written , and how Jean-Marc wanted to do it and how Alex [ Skarsgard ] and I worked on it , it was imperative that the relationship had this push-pull throughout the series , until it finally disintegrates . TVLINE | You mentioned the beach scene at the end , but we never really see any scenes of dialogue between the women after Perry s death . Was there anything you filmed that did n t make the final cut ? No , that was all Jean-Marc . He had it all in his head . When we all sit in the police station , we all had our own monologues , so you could have heard things . But in his head , cinematically , he had it shaped . The tie between the ocean and nature , and the way in which he shot the ocean , it s also a part of the whole series . It s so unpredictable , and the way we re all drawn to it â€¦ it has its own force . I love how he s done the silence there . TVLINE | Yeah , you do n t really need a scene of the women talking about Perry being the one who assaulted Jane , or Madeline and Bonnie settling their differences â€¦ You get it all . I mean , you hope people get it all . But I ve realized that the audience â€¦ they re so clever ! [ Laughs ] Oh my God ! The audiences are insanely clever . They re very bright , with all the shows . I m just glad that this strong female show has connected , because there s no reason for people to say , No , audiences will not watch these sorts of dramas . TVLINE | No , that s ridiculous . I do n t get that at all . I m a guy , and I found the whole series fascinating . I know when Keith watched it he got privy to it early , because he s married to the producer [ Laughs ] he was really part of my barometer . And he was like , This thing is so addictive . I said , Really ? He said , Oh , you have no idea . I m , like , salivating for the next episode . When do we get it ? When do we get it ? And he does n t normally say that ! He said , No , no , men will love this show . They ve just got to somehow find out about it . RELATEDBig Little Lies Playlist : The Ultimate Soundtrack to the HBO Miniseries TVLINE | I love that shot in the opening credits of all of the women walking towards the camera in a line , like it s a modeling runway . Was that just an ad-lib while you were shooting the finale ? Yeah , that s Jean-Marc . Jean-Marc is amazing . We did two weeks of night-shooting shooting that party , and he s like , Uh , I ve decided â€¦ just do this ! I want you all to dance towards the camera , and I m going to put music on . And we re like , What ? Uh , OK â€¦ But you go with him , because his vision is so powerful . And he has an editor s brain . He s been a DJ . So he s this multi-talented guy . He s masterful , in terms of what he s already thought of . And I would pretty much guarantee that he already thought of exactly how he was going to do that . And we re all thinking , Where is this gon na go ? What are we doing now ? But you just go with him , because that s his style . I love that he s such a renegade . TVLINE | And he earned your trust , because he was there every day , directing every episode . Oh , beyond . And also , he loves women , so he wants to depict them in a raw , honest way . And he was so committed to all of us . Reese s whole storyline â€¦ which I think is just glorious . You see this incredibly well thought out arc for her . And he knew Reese so well , so they have a great , intuitive language already . And then he already knew Laura as well . So he would be shooting each one of us separately , because we all had different storylines . Yet you would feel so protected and safe and special . That s really hard . And to give that to Shay [ Woodley ] , who had never worked with him , and then Zoe [ Kravitz ] , who is just magical â€¦ we were very , very lucky . RELATEDBig Little Lies : I Want a Season 2 and I Want It Now Please and Thank You TVLINE | You can see that trust in the scenes with Celeste and her therapist . They re so intimate , they feel like a two-person play . It was . He cleared the set out , and we were just kind of in there . I did n t really meet Robin [ Weigert ] , who plays the therapist , as Robin . I just met her as though we were completely in character . So it was very intense , and incredibly truthful . It was very strange . And we worked long days , so it was almost like we went into a different realm to do them . And it builds and builds and builds . We were able to shoot them in sequence , which is a blessing , in terms of a show like this . So we shot the Episode 3 one first , and then the next one â€¦ so by the end , we were both ragged . Like when I go into her at the end , and I m just like , Do n t touch me â€¦ all of that is very , very primal . And then the sexuality of the role , as well , is confronting . But it s so much a part of their relationship , and it s a very complicated sexuality . I just wanted it to be truthful . I wanted audiences to feel , and not sort of be voyeuristic , but more to feel like they re in there . Like you said , it s deeply intimate . And you re witnessing the intimacy , and all of its toxicity and pain and , I suppose , addiction . TVLINE | Those scenes of Perry abusing Celeste are very hard to watch . How do you choreograph those so no one gets hurt ? I read that you came home with bruises . Oh , yeah . That s the thing : We choreograph them , but I had to say to Alex , Do n t be frightened just to go for it with me , because this is so important that you see that there s a reality to it . It was strange . It was some of the strangest stuff I d ever done . [ Laughs ] It was very exposing . I felt unbelievably vulnerable , and at times humiliated , and at times just deeply exposed . And I do n t mean physically . I mean just emotionally , and the rawness of it . There was a point in the final episode where I m on the floor , and I just could n t get off the floor . I was just bare . And I remember Jean-Marc putting a towel over me in between takes , and I did n t even notice . I just laid there . And then I thought , God , I m sort of half losing my mind here . It was a very strange feeling . Very uncomfortable , very vulnerable . And I was lucky to have a partner who s an artist , and was able to sort of soothe me in a way . But it s important , because for that to read on television , it s got to be very in-your-face . I love when people say , I feel so uncomfortable watching it . They should ! They should n t be feeling turned on . They should feel like , What s going on here ? Because it s very confusing . It s confusing to Celeste and Perry . All they know is they re in the dance together . They ca n t get out . And they re completely compelled , and at the same time , they know they re really hurting each other . RELATEDPerformer of the Week : Big Little Lies â€˜ Nicole Kidman TVLINE | I know this was billed as a miniseries , but is there any possibility of a Season 2 ? Reese has said it would be up to the writer . [ Laughs ] Yeah , well , Liane [ Moriarty ] , because it s her story . She concocted it . And then David [ E. Kelley ] , because he then took it to the series level . So between Liane and David , I would hope that they could come up with something â€¦ I mean , it took us six months to shoot this . So we all went , Uh â€¦ OK ! I think if there was something compelling and extraordinary that they could come up with , then would we want to go and embody these women again ? That would be a beautiful prospect . And for us , I think there s also a strength in terms of our friendship . All five of us , there s a very , very strong connection through what it took to get the series made , you know ? But there s certainly nothing [ about Season 2 ] now , nothing that s solid or anything . I mean , it was a lot to get it to this point ! [ Laughs ] There are so many moving parts to this series that would be impossible not to have again . And who knows if it s meant to be finite ? But all of us , I think , feel so connected to it . And that it s had an impact , that it s penetrated the very , very dense world of television â€¦ there are so many shows ! But I love that people are responding to it . I love the emotional attachment to it . It s very rare . Do you want to see a Season 2 of Big Little Lies ? Give us your thoughts on that , and the season as a whole , in the comments below .

		"paragraph": "From Town & Country It 's no secret that members of the royal family are doing well for themselves-their collective net worth is estimated around the $ 88 billion mark according to Forbes , with Prince Harry and Prince William accounting for approximately $ 40 million each . But what about the latest royal to have captured the public 's imagination ? Princess Eugenie is a well-known figure in the UK , but the third of the Queen 's four granddaughters began to garner increased attention in America earlier this year after the announcement of her engagement to her longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank . Brooksbank proposed in January while on a trip to Nicaragua and the couple are slated to wed on October 12 in St. George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle , the same church that played host to her cousin Harry and Meghan 's big day . A wedding venue is n't the only thing that Eugenie shares with her new cousin-in-law either in fact , the Princess 's net worth is almost identical to Meghan 's pre-wedding net worth , at a cool $ 4.8 million . As you might expect , most of that money is thought to have comes to Eugenie via her grandmother the Queen and great-grandmother the Queen Mother , primarily in the form of trust funds . She also reportedly benefits from a substantial trust that was set up as part of the high-publicized divorce of her parents , Prince Andrew , Duke of York and Sarah \" Fergie \" Ferguson . Not all of Eugenie 's earnings come from family , though . When you think of the royal family , a 9-to-5 job may not be front and center , but Eugenie has been a dedicated career girl ( another thing she and Meghan have in common ) since she graduated from Newcastle University in 2013 with degrees in art history and English literature . She spent two years working in New York as a specialist at the online auction house Paddle8 , during which she and Brooksbank maintained a long-distance relationship , and currently works in London as an associate director of Hauser & Wirth , a contemporary art gallery .

		"paragraph": "By Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged on Sunday that his son met with Russians in 2016 at Trump Tower to get information on his election opponent Hillary Clinton , saying it was \" totally legal \" and \" done all the time in politics . \" The Republican president had previously said the meeting was about the adoption of Russian children by Americans . Trump 's morning Twitter post was his most direct statement on the purpose of the meeting , though his son and others have said it was to gather damaging information on the Democratic candidate . In a post on Twitter https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1026084333315153924 , Trump also denied reports in the Washington Post and CNN that he was concerned his eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , could be in legal trouble because of the meeting with the Russians , including a lawyer with Kremlin ties . He repeated that he had not known about the meeting in advance . \" Fake News reporting , a complete fabrication , that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son , Donald , had in Trump Tower . This was a meeting to get information on an opponent , totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere . I did not know about it ! \" Trump said . Political campaigns routinely pursue opposition research on their opponents , but not with foreign representatives from a country viewed as an adversary . Russian officials were under U.S. sanctions at the time . Special Counsel Robert Mueller is examining whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Russia to sway the White House race in his favor . One part of the inquiry has focused on a June 9 , 2016 , meeting at Trump Tower in New York between Donald Jr. , other campaign aides and a group of Russians . Email released by Donald Jr. himself showed he had been keen on the meeting because his father 's campaign was being offered potentially damaging information on Clinton . Donald Jr. said later he realized the meeting was primarily aimed at lobbying against the 2012 Magnitsky sanctions law , which led to Moscow denying Americans the right to adopt Russian orphans . President Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign worked with Moscow , saying \" No Collusion ! \" Last week , however , he adopted his lawyers ' tactics and insisted \" collusion is not a crime . \" While collusion is not a technical legal charge , Mueller could bring conspiracy charges if he finds that any campaign member worked with Russia to break U.S. law . Working with a foreign national with the intent of influencing a U.S. election could violate multiple laws , according to legal experts . CNN reported last month that Michael Cohen , the president 's longtime personal lawyer , was willing to tell Mueller that Trump did know about the Trump Tower meeting in advance . Trump 's lawyers and the White House have given conflicting accounts about whether Trump was involved in crafting Donald Jr. 's response to a New York Times article last summer revealing the Trump Tower meeting with the adoptions rationale . Trump 's lawyers acknowledged in a letter to Mueller 's team in January 2018 that Trump dictated the response , according to the Times . Trump has stepped up his public attacks on the Mueller probe since the first trial to arise from it began last week in Alexandria , Virginia , involving former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort . The federal tax and bank fraud charges Manafort faces are not related to the Trump campaign but Manafort 's close relations with Russians and a Kremlin-backed Ukrainian politician are under scrutiny in the trial . One of the president 's personal lawyers said on Sunday that if Trump is subpoenaed by the special counsel , his lawyers will attempt to quash it in court . Any legal battle over whether the president can be compelled to testify could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , the lawyer , Jay Sekulow , said on ABC 's \" This Week . \" U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Trump 's behalf . Putin has denied his government was involved . American intelligence officials say Russia is targeting the November congressional elections , which will determine whether or not Republicans keep control of both chambers of the U.S. Congress .

		"paragraph": "LATROBE , Pa. ( AP ) -- Artie Burns and Joe Haden do n't believe the Pittsburgh Steelers have a clear-cut No. 1 cornerback . The two feel they share that role . Haden has been a top cornerback in the league throughout his career and Burns , a 2016 first-round pick , feels like he 's starting to come into his own as he enters his third season . The two hope a full offseason and training camp together can help a young group of Steelers defensive backs regain some swagger . '' Right now , I 'm just trying to show him the way I go about my business , '' Haden said . '' Training camp is one of the biggest spots where we can see growth and we can see what the offseason did . '' Haden spent his first seven pro seasons in Cleveland . He feels an entire spring of organized team activities and minicamp with Burns and the Steelers will only prove beneficial as the team works through training camp and the preseason . '' I 'm trying to understand the whole defense , not just the corners and safety , but also the linebackers and defensive linemen , '' Haden said . '' I 'm just trying to get the whole system from the ground up and get an overall grasp of the defense . '' Cleveland released Haden on the eve of the 2017 regular season and the Steelers immediately acted . They quickly signed the two-time Pro Bowl cornerback with the hope he could give a young secondary an instant jolt . '' Having a veteran guy in your room that got to the level everybody wants to get to , '' Burns said , '' you kind of sit back and think that you can learn from him to get to that point . '' The Steelers did just that last season . Pittsburgh ranked 16th against the pass in 2016 , but Haden provided a necessary boost as the Steelers ended fifth in passing yards allowed . A 45-point outburst by Jacksonville in the AFC divisional playoff marred an otherwise strong season . '' I think the communication was the biggest thing for us , just no blown coverages , '' Haden said . '' In the Jacksonville game , there were a couple times where people were just running free . We have the ability , we have the players , we just have to be on the same page and make sure everybody 's covering their man . '' That has been the focus for Burns . He has carried a noticeably different , more confident swagger during training camp practices . He 's still locked into regular one-on-one practice battles with four-time All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown , a daily matchup Burns welcomes . '' Ever since I got here it 's been a battle with ( Brown ) , '' Burns said . '' It 's just something I expect from myself . I do n't even request it . I just step up , we go at it and go to work . '' It has already paid off for the third-year cornerback . Burns jumped Brown 's slant route during the team 's first padded practice and picked off Landry Jones 's pass in the end zone . He also jumped a Ben Roethlisberger pass and came up with an interception that would 've been returned for a touchdown . Burns said that sort of intuition comes with experience . '' You can feel the speed of the receiver , '' Burns said . '' A play can only go for so long , so once you figure out the timing of it , that 's when you have a chance to make a play on the ball . '' Burns seeks similar game-changing plays alongside Haden in the secondary this season . '' ( Haden ) is helping us in certain situations that he has already been put in before , '' Burns said . '' That 's what Joe is doing for us . '' NOTES : Coach Mike Tomlin said Brown was sent to Pittsburgh to be evaluated for a '' minor , day-to-day '' injury . Brown missed the previous two practices with his undisclosed injury . Tomlin would n't say what sort of injury . ... S Morgan Burnett ( hamstring ) , Sean Davis ( groin ) , T.J. Watt ( hamstring ) , Vance McDonald ( foot ) and Alejandro Villanueva ( undisclosed ) also missed practice on Thursday . --- For more NFL coverage : http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen pointed Tuesday to a solid U.S. job market and economy and said the Fed will likely resume raising interest rates in the next few months . But with uncertainties surrounding President Donald Trump 's proposals , Yellen said the Fed still wants to keep assessing the economy . Testifying to a Senate committee , Yellen noted that Fed officials forecast in December that they would raise rates three times in 2017 . That would mark an acceleration from 2015 and 2016 , when they boosted rates once each year . \" Precisely when we would take an action , whether it is March , or May or June ... I ca n't tell you which meeting it would be , \" Yellen said in response to a question . \" I would say that every meeting is live . \" Though Yellen did n't rule out a rate hike at the Fed 's next meeting in mid-March , most economists and investors think the next one will occur in June . Until then , the details of Trump 's ambitious proposals for tax cuts for individuals and businesses , greater spending on infrastructure projects , changes to trade deals and a relaxation of regulations could remain hazy . \" With the uncertainty over fiscal policy likely to last for at least another few months , that means the Fed will probably be on hold until June , \" said Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics . Other analysts say they think that while three Fed rate hikes will occur in 2017 , all of them may happen in the second half of the year . In her first congressional appearance since Trump took office , Yellen avoided making critical observations of the president 's economic ideas . During the campaign , Trump was at times harshly dismissive of Yellen . At one point , he had declared that she should be \" ashamed of herself \" for , in his view , keeping rates low to favor Democrats . In her remarks , Yellen did caution that any economic initiatives that significantly swell long-term budget deficits would likely slow growth . But she offered support for part of Trump 's agenda : His efforts to make it easier for smaller banks to lend , in part by liberating them from some rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law . She said the Fed has been trying to ease the regulatory burden on community banks and is open to doing more . Yellen said the Fed 's interest rate policies would evolve , in part , from how spending and tax changes enacted by Congress affect economic growth . Right now , she said , \" it 's too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold . \" Trump has argued that his economic initiatives can achieve his goal of doubling annual economic growth to 4 percent , up from the tepid 2 percent pace that 's prevailed since the Great Recession ended in 2009 . Most economists say 4 percent annual growth is unrealistic given the nation 's slow-growing population and weak worker productivity growth . Trump 's new Treasury secretary , Steven Mnuchin , told reporters Tuesday that \" there is a tradition of the secretary of the Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve , and I look forward to that now that I am in office , doing that and spending time with her . \" In her testimony Tuesday the first of two days marking her semiannual report to Congress on interest rate policy Yellen reiterated that she plans to serve the final year of her four-year term as Fed chair , which ends next February . She will testify to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday . Trump has the opportunity to fill three vacancies on the Fed 's seven-member policymaking board after Daniel Tarullo , a board member who was guiding the Fed 's regulatory efforts , announced Friday that he would resign this spring . Yellen told senators that she looked forward to working with new members of the Fed board . She said Fed officials still think rate hikes can occur at a gradual pace . But she cautioned , as she has in the past , that \" waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise , potentially requiring the ( Fed ) to eventually raise rates rapidly , which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession . \"",

		"paragraph": "Not so long ago Microsoft ( MSFT ) was the undisputed king of technology , controlling about 90 % of the market for operating systems . But as demand moved from desktops to laptops and then to tablets and smartphones , Microsoft lost its market reign to Google ( GOOG ) and Apple ( AAPL ) . A report released today by Gartner , the technology research and advisory firm , forecasts that by 2017 shipments of devices using Google s Android operating system will dwarf shipments of Windows PCs and phones . Shipments of Apple iPhones and iPads will be almost at parity with devices powered by Microsoft . Microsoft could be completely irrelevant in three or four years if they ca n t make headway in the smartphone or tablet market , where they ve been struggling , says The Daily Ticker 's Henry Blodget . The numbers are staggering . Gartner forecasts that by 2017 the number of tablets , mobile phones and ultramobile devices will total 2.7 billion units almost 10 times the number of desktop and notebook PCs . The stock market already reflects this shift in the device market . The market is basically saying [ Microsoft ] is not a growth story . It 's treated almost like a wasting asset , if you look at the current books and current cash flow , says Michael Santoli , senior columnist at Yahoo! Finance . Related : Apple on the Defensive as Samsung Prepares to Launch Huge New Phone Microsoft shares are down nearly 9 % year-over-year while Google shares have rallied over 25 % . While Apple 's shares have fallen a startling 31 % year-over-year , many would argue that these numbers are n't indicative of sales and cash flow but instead of leadership changes and more competition . The challenge Microsoft faces now is how to stay relevant . Can it catch up in the tablet and smartphone market , where it s been operating for years without much success , or must it try something completely different ? Santoli says Microsoft may need to acknowledge that it ca n t just survive based on its old architecture . He says the company is trapped by its near monopoly business that makes so much money which does n t inspire much risk taking . Related : Former Microsoft Employee Says Steve Ballmer Must Go Perhaps it s time for Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to try something else .

		"paragraph": "FLOWERY BRANCH , Ga. ( AP ) -- Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank believes players should have the right to speak out on important issues even though he is n't expecting his players to protest during the national anthem this season . Blank says just like last season , Falcons players have been asked to stand for the national anthem . He said the Falcons are '' very committed to the military . '' He also says he believes players have '' very significant rights '' and appeared to say he would n't fine players for exercising those rights . Blank said players should be allowed to make their own decisions on what he described as the '' complex issue '' of standing or kneeling for the national anthem . '' So if you have players who still feel that 's the way they have to express themselves , they will , '' he said , adding '' I do n't think you 'll see '' protests . '' But it 's far better in my opinion to have somebody make those decisions themselves than to hit them over the head with a hammer , '' he said . Blank 's comments came as the NFL and NFLPA , the players ' union , held what they said in a joint statement was '' a constructive meeting '' about the anthem policy . They said their talks will continue . Last season , two Falcons defensive linemen - Grady Jarrett and Dontari Poe , now with Carolina - knelt during the anthem before the team 's game at Detroit on Sept. 24 . After the game , coach Dan Quinn described the action as a '' one-off . '' The Falcons held a team meeting and decided players would stand together during the anthem for other games . Quinn said that decision was not a written policy '' but more one that was really based on the heart of brotherhood to say , ' What we do , we 'll do it together . '' ' No players took a knee during the anthem the remainder of the season . --- More AP NFL : https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP-NFL",

		"paragraph": "Since the release of Halloween in 1978 , nine films have followed in the series , with varying levels of unsuccess . The last attempt to revive the franchise came under Rob Zombie s supervision in 2007 , but it was plagued by poor reviews and , following Zombie s 2009 sequel , Michael Myers s murder-happy franchise has been dormant . That all changed in 2016 , when Miramax , Jason Blum , and original director John Carpenter announced they were teaming to produce a new installment . Months later , Pineapple Express filmmaker David Gordon Green and longtime collaborator and Vice Principals star Danny McBride came on board to write a script and Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to return as Laurie Strode . But with all the films and the convoluted story lines over the past 40 years , the filmmakers made a bold choice : The 2018 release will ignore decades of mayhem and serve as a direct sequel to the events in the 1978 classic . Curtis , Green , Blum , and longtime Halloween producer Malek Akkad spoke to Yahoo Entertainment at the San Diego Comic-Con 2018 about the newest iteration ( watch above ) . Watch : Halloween ( 2018 ) trailer : It really had to do with the integrity of Laurie , Curtis told us , admitting she was excited to return to the franchise that launched her career . Where Laurie was and what kind of story they were trying to tell . And I love that they sort of omitted and released the other sequels to live as their own worlds . But that we were only going from 1978 to 2018 . And it felt very powerful . It really is a movie about trauma and the power you can take back from someone . Not unlike many women all around the world who have started to say , â€˜ You no longer control the narrative . â€¦ That s a powerful statement for a woman . And I think by the end of the movie , you will see that Laurie has taken back her own narrative . Only two actors from the first film are returning for the 2018 go-round : Curtis and Nick Castle ( Michael Meyers/The Shape ) . But Green teased that the movie will bring back the late Donald Pleasence s Dr. Loomis . In a matter of speaking . Literally . We have a Donald Pleasence soundalike , the director said . Because obviously he s no longer with us , but having someone that could mimic his voice was a fun challenge . And we nailed it , I think . If I do say so myself . And then there s a couple other [ nods to the past films ] . There s a vocal cameo you may or may not notice till the end credits . While Carpenter s involvement in the sequels has waxed and waned , he told Deadline in 2017 that Green and McBride blew me away . I might even do the music . Maybe . It could be kind of cool . Carpenter is indeed working on the score for the film . According to Green and Blum , Carpenter s involvement was essential to them . I do n t think I would have done it [ without Carpenter s blessing ] , Green said . He s been a big part of this , â€¦ he s doing the score for the film right now , that s why he s not [ in San Diego for Comic-Con ] . I needed him . I think [ not getting Carpenter s OK ] would have stopped us , noted Blum . John asked me very specifically , â€˜ Do I have approvals ? And then the answer [ was ] , â€˜ You do n t have approvals , but if you do n t like it , we re not going to keep going either . I think there might have been a movie , but we would n t have been involved either if John was n t happy . For Akkad , producing Halloween films has been a family affair . His father , Moustapha Akkad , produced every Halloween film up to his death in 2005 . We asked the younger Akkad how felt about this new movie ejecting all those other films from the canon . I have to admit , I was surprised , Akkad shared . And maybe it took me a little bit , a little convincing , but [ Gordon Green ] is a very convincing guy . â€¦ As this sort of started taking momentum , it made more and more sense . So my initial reaction was maybe not 100 percent onboard . And then very quickly , in a matter of a week , after in-depth conversations with everybody , I [ felt ] this is awesome . We had been trying for almost seven years [ and dealing with ] various stops and starts and different writers , Akkad continued . At the time , John was n t involved with those [ attempts ] so it would have [ been made ] in some other universe , but once we got settled with Miramax and Blumhouse we sort of had a freedom again to really look at it . One of the first calls I made was to John , and fortunately he was onboard and supportive , and that s the way it should be . Curtis , however , told us that she might have signed on with or without John Carpenter s blessing . John has a life way outside of Halloween , she told us . I do n t know if you know , his concert tour is coming back and he s going to be playing the Palladium on Halloween night . He has a beautiful career . Watch : M.

		"paragraph": "Alexis Ohanian called the public reaction to his wife , tennis star Serena Williams , defending herself against an umpire bullshit when viewed in comparison to the assessments of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee . Williams was criticized for responding emotionally to an umpire s calls during her U.S. Open tennis final last month . Kavanaugh was also visibly upset during his testimony two weeks ago something the White House defended . Deborah Barros , a candidate for Alabama State Senate , wrote in a tweet on Saturday that it was funny how a black female tennis player is held to a higher standard to keep her emotions in check than a Supreme Court nominee . Reddit co-founder Ohanian responded to Barros tweet with a brief thread , saying , it s not funny , it s bullshit , before lacing into Kavanaugh s behavior . At different points during his testimony , Kavanaugh cried , shouted , turned senators questions back on themselves and took many a dramatic pause . His behavior was widely discussed on social media afterward , with many remarking that had he been a woman , his emotional reaction would be perceived very differently . Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court Saturday . Williams , who was accused of receiving coaching during her final against Naomi Osaka , ultimately lost the match because of violations the umpire doled out in reaction to Williams defending herself . The incident led to articles across the globe criticizing her behavior and even a racist and sexist caricature of the tennis star in The Herald Sun . Ohanian ended his thoughts by writing , if you re going to be a Supreme Court Justice a job that requires maintaining sober judgement it should n t matter what questions you have to answer in your job interview , you keep it together . He also added that he looks forward to the cartoon [ Herald Sun editor Damon Johnson ] puts on the front page about it .

		"paragraph": "As the Trump administration continues to forcibly separate immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border , babies and other young children are being sent to tender age shelters in Texas , The Associated Press reported Tuesday night . At least three shelters , in Combes , Raymondville and Brownsville in South Texas , are currently operating , the report said . Visitors to the centers described playrooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis . Children at the shelters were found to be hysterical , crying and acting out . A fourth shelter , which could house up to 240 children , is reportedly being planned for Houston . Sylvester Turner , Houston s mayor , has said the shelter is not welcome in his city . The thought that they are going to be putting such little kids in an institutional setting ? I mean it is hard for me to even wrap my mind around it , Kay Bellor of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service , a nonprofit that provides child welfare services to migrant children , told AP this week . Toddlers are being detained , she said . The administration has taken more than 2,300 children from their parents since early May , when the White House announced its zero tolerance policy for illegal border crossing . Officials on Tuesday said they did n t know how many of these children were younger than 5 . CNN reported last week that a mother from Honduras said her breastfeeding baby was taken from her by federal agents while she was awaiting prosecution at an immigrant detention center . Michelle Brane , director of migrant rights at the Women s Refugee Commission , described seeing 5-year-olds in cages alone with no adult care and a 4-year-old whose diapers were being changed by other detained children as she visited a facility where migrants were being held . On Monday , ProPublica released an audio clip of 10 young Central American children held by Border Patrol many of them crying so hard that it sounded as if they could barely breathe . Trump officials this week defended the tender age shelters , saying they are well-equipped for providing care to young children . We have specialized facilities that are devoted to providing care to children with special needs , and tender age children as we define as under 13 would fall into that category , Steven Wagner , a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services , told AP . They re not government facilities per se , and they have very well-trained clinicians , and those facilities meet state licensing standards for child welfare agencies , and they re staffed by people who know how to deal with the needs particularly of the younger children . Lawyers and medical professionals who visited the shelters said they found the facilities to be clean and safe but stressed it was n t the centers themselves that were the issue . The shelters are n t the problem , it s taking kids from their parents that s the problem , Marsha Griffin , a South Texas pediatrician who has visited several shelters , told AP . Research has shown that institutionalizing children can cause lasting emotional scars , as well as physical and mental health issues . [ Separating ] children and parents at the border is a practice that has the potential to cause significant , lifelong harm to the children involved , wrote the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners in a statement last week denouncing the practice . Research clearly shows that traumatic life experiences in childhood , especially those that involve loss of a caregiver or parent , cause lifelong risk for cardiovascular and mental health disease . It remains unclear how long the Trump administration intends to hold the thousands of children in their care in shelter facilities . It s also unknown how long these children will be kept from their families .",

Allen has been documenting her eviction from a Texas caravan park on YouTube , and her story was reported by The Guardian . She has also set up a GoFundMe page to try to raise money after losing her home . Allen still works at the Amazon fulfillment center in Haslet , Texas , where she was injured and is living in her car in the parking lot of the warehouse . In an update to her GoFundMe page , Allen said she had found somewhere to live more permanently but needed money to pay the first month 's rent and deposit . She posted an update to YouTube on Tuesday in which she called out Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos . \" I ca n't believe this is my life now ... I work for the world 's richest man and I live in my car , \" she said . According to The Guardian , Allen was working at the Haslet warehouse on October 24 when she injured her back counting goods on a workstation . That station was reportedly missing a piece of safety equipment designed to stop items from falling onto the floor . Allen injured herself while using a tote bin a large plastic or metal container as a temporary replacement for the safety equipment and counting items while in an awkward position . \" I tried to work again , but I could n't stretch my right arm out and I 'm right-handed , \" Allen told the newspaper . \" So I was having a hard time keeping up . This went on for about three weeks . \" According to Allen 's account , Amazon gave her medical attention but management sent her home each day without pay while she was unable to work . She subsequently dealt with nine months of issues and , she said , Amazon 's management offered her just one week of paid leave . \" They offered me a buyout , only for $ 3,500 , which meant I would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement to not say anything derogatory about Amazon or my experience , \" she said . Allen says she declined the offer so she could talk about her experiences , and she posted a YouTube video at the end of June titled \" Becoming Homeless . \" In it , she showed footage of her belongings in a storage unit , apparently making room so she could sleep in the back seat of her car . \" We do n't recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of working at Amazon , \" an Amazon spokeswoman told Business Insider in an email . \" We are proud of our safety record and thousands of Amazonians work hard every day innovating ways to make it even better . \" Amazon has created over 130,000 jobs in the last year alone and now employs over 560,000 people around the world . Ensuring the safety of these associates is our number one priority . \" Dozens of former Amazon workers have spoken out about their experiences working at the company 's warehouses . In April , Business Insider spoke with many workers who criticized the company 's record on safety and harsh practices like timing breaks . One worker said he believed coworkers were peeing in trash cans because they did not want to use time to visit a restroom . Another talked about suffering an asthma attack during a shift and struggling with the physical nature of the work . The same month , US private nonprofit group the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health found seven people had died on the job at Amazon warehouses since 2013 .

Membership revenue soared 67 % , online advertising jumped 52 % , and content distribution climbed 44 % , all in local currency and year over year . The bulk of iQiyi 's revenue is divided almost evenly between subscriptions and advertising , which combine for more than 87 % of the company 's sales . The free , ad-supported model attracts the majority of the company 's customers . Others pay subscription fees for access to the premium , ad-free content , which also includes exclusive programming not available to other viewers . The company generates additional sales from content distribution , online games , and merchandising . For the second quarter , iQiyi expects net revenue in a range of 5.8 billion yuan to 6.04 billion yuan ( between $ 857 million and $ 892 million at current exchange rates ) . This would represent year-over-year growth of between 42 % and 48 % . Analysts , for their part , are expecting revenue of 6 billion yuan ( roughly $ 886.3 million ) -- near the high end of management 's estimates . iQiyi 's biggest growth opportunity will be converting users from the free , ad-supported model to paid subscriptions . At the time of its IPO , iQiyi reported 50.8 million paying subscribers , and the company did n't provide an update when it issued its first-quarter financial release . Investors should be on the lookout for any update on subscriber numbers . In its short life as a publicly traded security , iQiyi stock has bounced around like a pogo stick . In less than 90 days , shares soared as much as 184 % , before falling 32 % over the next 16 days . The stock is still up more than 100 % from its price at the end of its first day of trading . Quite often , double-digit moves will not be accompanied by any news . The company is not yet profitable , and does n't expect to be for some time , as it is spending heavily to stock its content library . iQiyi has a frothy valuation , with a 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 8.5 -- significantly higher than the range of 1 to 2 which is considered good ( or below 1 , which is considered excellent ) . With a sky-high valuation like that , the volatility of this stock is likely to continue for the near future . That said , for patient investors with a long time horizon , iQiyi has a shot at the streaming title in its native China .

The untitled song was posted to her Instagram account to much fanfare , but then later deleted ( perhaps because of said fanfare after all , she is the product of rock royalty Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love ) . A post shared by Frances Bean Cobain ( @space witch666 ) on May 3 , 2018 at 5:44 pm PDT Now , the younger Cobain has taken to Instagram to share a slightly different version of the song featuring altered lyrics and the addition of acoustic guitar . I think I found you when I was small / I think I found you / A penny for your good thoughts , she sings in the video clip while strumming along . If the track itself is n t enough to convey all the right emotions , her expressive body language throughout the performance will . Cobain captioned the video Not hey there delilah , a reference to Plain White T s acoustic hit from 2006 . In the comments section of the Instagram post , she acknowledged that she plans to one day officially release the untitled song echoing previous statements regarding her intentions to pursue a music career . Cobain also replied to one fan who compared her and her parents musical style : You are probably right in the respect that people probably can make assumptions or conclusions about my art because they are informed about my life s trajectory , she wrote .

		"paragraph": "Tuesday is a very important day . Not only is does it mark the one-month wedding anniversary of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry , but it s also the day when British royals attend the Royal Ascot horse race . Now , do I care about horse races ? No . Do I think human-led races are good activities for horses ? Definitely not . Would I ever watch a horse race of my own volition ? Ca n t say I would . So then , why do I care so much about this event ? Because of all the bizarrely British hats that pop up at the Ascot , of course ! This year s Royal Ascot the annual horse race that always has at least one day dedicated to fancy people wearing extravagant hats did not disappoint . The event was full of huge chapeaus , horse-related headgear , and hugely frightening fascinators that will surely give me nightmares for weeks . Here , some of the best ( and in many ways , also the worst ) hats from this year s Royal Ascot . First , this one on an unidentified woman . It s fancy and probably expensive , but does n t it also look spooky ? I m afraid ! This hat , also on an unidentified woman , makes me want a fruit plate , even though it is a hat with flowers and not fruit . Ah yes , this hat below , I believe , is now the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of art . What a giant flower ! This hat is also floral . And behold , several brightly colored hats below ! Okay , can you identify the woman below ? Yes , it s none other than horse fan Queen Elizabeth II ! I think her hat looks lovely . It s so bright and yellow in a wonderfully ridiculous springtime way . Look at these giant roses atop this woman s head ! The colors of this hat below are pretty but why are so many butterflies clustered together ? So , I d say this hat is frightening as well , just because I do n t understand the bug-related mystery . Below , a guy in a pink top hat ! I love it ! It looks like she is just balancing a bunch of random objects on her head . Lo , the most giant flower of all ! And let s wrap this up with the rest of the lady royals . Their hats are n t the most ridiculous many of them have worn remember Princess Beatrice s hat at Prince William and Kate Middleton s royal wedding ? It was so bananas that it became a Halloween costume that year ! but still , each of these hats are still delightfully bizarre and British . Here s Princess Beatrice and her sister , Princess Eugenie . And then Princess Anne , who just welcomed a new grandchild that morning . Congrats to her and her hat ! And lastly , our girl Meghan Markle , who looks great but is still wearing a giant hat . Thank you for being you , fancy British hats ! Related Articles ",

		"paragraph": "Before the season tipped off , this is the Eastern Conference Finals we expected . However , the path to get here was nothing like we envisioned . Gordon Hayward out . Kyrie Irving out . Cleveland radically shaking up its roster at the trade deadline . Yet in the end , here we are a repeat of last year s conference finals that the Cavaliers won . They are the favorites again , but this series is not going to be a sweep like the round before , the Celtics are disciplined and playing at a higher level than anyone the Cavs have seen this postseason . Boston has a shot to win this . Here are three things to watch in this series . 1 ) Can the Celtics wear down LeBron James with multiple fresh defenders ? The question is n t who is guarding LeBron ? but rather how many guys will be guarding LeBron ? The Celtics have a wealth of defenders who will get their turn on The King : Al Horford , Jaylen Brown , Marcus Smart , Marcus Morris , Jayson Tatum ( in very limited stints ) , Semi Ojeleye ( off the bench ) , heck I would n t be surprised to see Brad Stevens ask Dave Cowens if he can still give them 10 good minutes . The idea is to keep fresh bodies on LeBron and hope that he wears down just a little having to work harder to get his shots . The bigger question is how will the Celtics choose to defend LeBron ? In the last two series , Boston was willing to largely single cover the opposing team s star and let him rack up points Giannis Antetokounmpo then Joel Embiid but then stay home on the shooters and the rest of the players . It s a good plan , one the Raptors tried to employ last round rookie OG Anunoby did a respectable job on LeBron ( as much as can be expected ) but the Raptors did not silence Kevin Love , Kyle Korver , or J.R. Smith . If Boston goes with this system they will face a serious challenge because LeBron is both a high IQ player and a gifted passer . However , Boston is a far more disciplined defense that is far more switchable , has far more mobile big men , and does n t make the mistakes that Toronto ( and before them Indiana did ) . Boston is going to follow the standard book to a degree and try to turn LeBron into a jumpshooter . LeBron is going to have to carry an even bigger load this series . He s also fully capable of that . 2 ) Will a season of bad defensive habits from the Cavaliers catch up with them ? No need to rehash how the Celtics were 29th in the NBA in defense during the regular season , but if you think they have been much better in the playoffs , think again : Cleveland allowed 109.5 points per 100 possessions during the regular season , it has been 108.4 per 100 in the playoffs ( 10th out of the 16 teams ) . Cleveland s defensive effort has been better , as it will be in this series , but their communication and recognition have not been sharp . That s something Boston can exploit because this is not a team where the defense can just target one guy ( Victor Oladipo ) or even two ( Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan ) . The Celtics get their buckets out of their system and trust all five guys on the floor to make the right pass , the right cut , and when the time comes take the shot . Boston makes a defense work for the entire 24 seconds , Cleveland has not been good at second and third defensive efforts . Cavaliers defenders can get twisted around on pick-and-rolls , and particularly dribble handoffs ( which the Celtics run a lot of ) . All of which is to say Boston is going to rack up points in this series . The challenge will be getting stops against that Cavalier offense on the other end . 3 ) How will Cleveland primarily defend Al Horford , with Kevin Love or Tristan Thompson ? The answer to this question is less about Horford and more about Tyronn Lue s philosophy for the series , is he thinking offensively or defensively ? We ll find out quickly with how he chooses to start the game against Boston . In the previous series against Toronto , Kevin Love started at the five and it was a huge advantage for Cleveland on offense because it pulled Jonas Valanciunas away from the basket and forced him to defend in space , something he struggled with ( and JV could n t make Love pay on defense ) . However , in the first round against the Pacers , Thompson and his defensive presence in the paint and on the offensive glass proved to be important for Cleveland . Boston brings Horford to the table he is comfortable protecting the rim and playing inside , plus he can step out and defend on the perimeter . Love and Korver s corner action is not going to flummox Horford like it did JV and the Raptors , he will sniff it out and make plays . On the other end , something to watch : Boston may try to run a lot of pick-and-rolls with Horford setting the screen for LeBron s man ( or , if LeBron is on Jaylen Brown as he was often during the season , Brown sets the screen ) just to force LeBron to switch and be active on defense . Yes that means pulling Cleveland s best defender into the play , but it also makes LeBron work on defense , where mostly the Cavs try to hide him and let him rest until key moments of the game . This is part of the wear him ou t strategy from above .",

Epic is now gearing up for another event , but you might only have one opportunity to see it live . Not long ago , a countdown timer began appearing on the TVs scattered around Fortnite s map . No one knows exactly what the timer is counting down to , but it runs out at 1:30 PM ET this Saturday . Whatever Epic has been planning this whole time , we ll finally see the fruits of their labor on Saturday afternoon . While Epic has n t formally announced what will happen this Saturday , something else has been taking place on the island in recent days , and many Fortnite players suspect that the two are related . In addition to the countdown , there have also been sirens blasting near the hidden super villain lair , which sprouted up in season 4 : As The Verge notes , the lair just so happens to house a giant rocket . It does n t seem like much of a stretch to assume that after pelting the map with meteorites last season , Epic will launch a rocket into the stratosphere this time around .

		"paragraph": "While Donald Trump plays little general with the NFL , basketball s two biggest stars agree that the eventual NBA championship team has no plans to visit the White House . I know whoever wins this series , no one wants an invite , Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James was quoted as saying today as the NBA Finals shifts to Ohio for Game 3 on Wednesday . His sentiment was shared by rival Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry , who said in an interview : I agree with â€˜ Bron . Pretty sure the way we handled things last year , kinda staying consistent with that . He s referring to his 2017 championship team that famously skipped the traditional meeting with the president . Both future first-ballot Hall of Famers who are meeting in the NBA Finals for a fourth consecutive year were weighing in on Trump s ongoing feud with the NFL and its Players Who Protest . The latest salvo in that war came Monday when POTUS decalred that the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow . They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem , hand on heart , in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country . Oh the delicious irony that the NFL champs are from the Birthplace of American Democracy and their nickname is taken from the National Emblem . And by the way , no Eagles player knelt or sat for the national anthem all season . Not one . But there s also another pro-sports championship series going on at the moment . No one from the NHL has weighed in officially about the White House ruckus , but how fun would it be if the Washington Capitals win the Stanley Cup ? ( They re up 3-1 over the expansion Vegas Golden Knights . ) Not only would it be the first Cup in the franchise s 44-year history , the team is captained by Alexander Ovechkin who certainly would n t be the first Russian to visit the White House lately .

		"paragraph": "From Marie Claire Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank quite literally had to postpone their wedding date for their cousins Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , which is something most brides and grooms do n't have to do-unless you require two of the most well-known people in the world to attend your wedding , of course . But it was important to Princess Eugenie and Jack that the couple be there . And as more details emerge about Princess Eugenie 's wedding , she and Meghan have an increasing amount of similarities when it comes to their big days . See how the royals ' weddings are shaping up to compare to each other , below . Harry and Meghan 's ceremony on Saturday , May 19 started at noon London time , but Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will have their ceremony on Friday , October 12 at 11 a.m. London time . Normally a Friday wedding indicates a more casual ceremony , but this definitely will not be the case ( see dress code section below ) . You can find out how to watch Princess Eugenie 's wedding here . Like Harry and Meghan , Eugenie and Jack will have their ceremony at St. George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . Only two weeks after Eugenie and Jack 's wedding , the castle will be the home of Harry and Meghan 's special wedding exhibition where her Givenchy gown will be on display , but not the second dress she wore to the evening reception . VISIT WINDSOR CASTLE St. George 's Chapel is practically unrecognizable in the before-and-after pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex 's wedding . It 's currently unknown how Eugenie and Jack will decorate the chapel , but if it 's anything like Harry and Meghan 's wedding it will be adorned in gorgeous flowers . Eugenie did reveal , however , that unlike her cousins ' wedding she will be keeping everything plastic-free in an effort to remain more environmentally conscious . It s been eye-opening . My whole house is anti-plastic now and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well , \" Eugenie told British Vogue in August . Eugenie and Jack 's wedding dress code is \" morning coat or a day dress with a hat , \" as indicated on their wedding invitations . This is a lot more formal than Harry and Meghan 's wedding dress code , which was \" morning coat or lounge suit , day dress with hat . \" Since Eugenie and Jack probably do n't have many American friends coming to their wedding like Meghan and Harry did , it makes sense that they would stick to the morning coat attire for males . Eugenie and Jack are inviting lucky members of the public to attend their wedding at Windsor Castle , just like Harry and Meghan did . Though the amount of public members invited to Eugenie and Jack 's wedding ( 1,200 ) are significantly lower than Harry and Meghan invited ( 2,640 ) , Eugenie and Jack 's actual guest list will include a couple hundred more people than the Duke and Duchess ' big day . At their ceremony , Harry and Meg had around 650 friends and family present , whereas Eugenie and Jack will have close to 850 . Vanity Fair published the first look at Eugenie and Jack 's wedding invitations , and they look completely different from Harry and Meghan 's . You can see a visual comparison of them here . Meghan Markle reportedly enlisted the help of close friend and BFF Jessica Mulroney to plan her wedding , but Princess Eugenie is going the more traditional route and reportedly hired wedding planner Peregrine Armstrong-Jones . He 's responsible for the lavish wedding of David and Victoria Beckham in 1999 . Princess Eugenie , 28 , has chosen her older sister Princess Beatrice , 30 , as has her maid of honor . Meanwhile , Meghan chose not to have a maid of honor at all . The Dean of Windsor , David Conner will be officiating Eugenie and Jack 's wedding . The Archbishop of Canterbury , Justin Welby officiated Meghan and Harry 's ceremony . Harry and Meghan 's carriage ride through Windsor was a complete lovefest ( they snuck a second kiss ! ) , and Eugenie and Jack are planning to take a similar route ( literally ) . However , they wo n't ride along the Long Walk like the Duke and Duchess did . According to the royal family website , \" After the service , [ Eugenie and Jack ] will undertake a short ride in a carriage from the Royal Mews , out of Windsor Castle , and on to part of the High Street . Opportunities for members of the public wishing to view the couple are on Castle Hill , the High Street and Park Street , echoing the route taken by The Earl and Countess of Wessex following their wedding . The carriage will not travel along the Long Walk . \" Town & Country reports that Meghan Markle and Princess Eugenie will both carry similar bouquets down the aisle . It 's royal tradition to carry a sprig of Myrtle , which represents love . Eugenie 's mother , Sarah Ferguson , also had Myrtle in her bouquet . Eugenie admitted that she 's been \" compiling Pinterest boards of cakes \" in her British Vogue interview , but has not yet revealed what her cake will look or taste like . Meghan and Harry had Claire Ptak , a London-based pastry chef from California , make a spring-inspired , lemon elderflower cake for their wedding . Eugenie , Jack , Meghan , and Harry will all have had a wedding reception luncheon hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle following their ceremonies , but Eugenie and Jack are taking the celebrations a bit further than Harry and Meghan . Their wedding will be a two-day event where the couple will have a \" festival and funfair \" themed party on the grounds of the Royal Lodge , the York Family home located about three miles south from Windsor Castle . Like Harry and Meghan , Eugenie and Jack will likely have an evening reception the night they say \" I do \" as well . Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank 's wedding is estimated to cost around $ 3 million , which is a whole lot less than Harry and Meghan 's reported $ 43 million . Royals , amirite ? This post will be updated as more details emerge about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank 's wedding on October 12 . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap contains spoilers for Episode 5 of The Bachelor . Hello , rose lovers ! Time to rejoin Corinne and Taylor s partially orchestrated catfight , already in progress : Corinne : You re hurting my feelings , Taylor ! Taylor : Maturity and emotional intelligence can kind of go hand in hand . Corinne : No , it ca n t ! And so it goes . Corinne calls Taylor rude and questions whether she s here for the Right Reasons , while Taylor crinkles her brow and makes a Bish , please face . This is the most anticipated showdown of the season , Chris Harrison ? Try again , pal . Can we just get to the rose ceremony please ? Related : Chris Harrison Blogs â€˜ The Bachelor Episode 5 Nope ! Because first , we have to watch Corinne pull Nick aside again , this time to trash-talk Taylor . Nick s all , Uh-huh , uh-huh , OK , and he thanks Corinne for being so honest . So , is he a total sucker , or is he just fending off a Corinne freak-out by telling her what she wants to hear ? Survey says â€¦ Yes , Taylor gets a rose . ( Does n t she look happy about it ? ) The therapist joins Whitney ( WHO ? ) , Danielle M. , Jasmine , Rachel , Jaimi , Josephine , Vanessa , Alexis , Corinne , Raven , and Kristina in the winners circle , meaning tonight we say goodbye to Astrid she of the insufficiently supportive jog bra and Sarah , who I had to look up on the ABC cast page . Bye , ladies ! Now , on to New Orleans ! Wrong show , honey . Anyhow , after the obligatory look at our awesome hotel suite segment , Harrison drops by with the good news : It s two-on-one date week ! And judging by Taylor s face , she knows exactly how this is going to go down . Hold that thought , honey ! Your abject humiliation will have to wait for a while , because right now Rachel has her first one-on-one date with the Bachelor . They stroll through the French Market sampling oysters and hot sauce , and smooching intermittently in front of bemused and confused tourists . My chemistry with Rachel is probably the most explosive chemistry I have at this point with any of the women , says Nick . She kind of has it all . Agreed , Rachel is delightful and she s got some good dance moves too . Kudos to Team Bachelor , by the way , for staging that parade directly under the women s hotel room . The day portion of the date ends with an oddly brief pit stop at a Lolo concert and the next thing we know , it s nighttime and Nick and Rachel are having their take things to the next level private dinner inside Mardi Gras World museum . There , Rachel reveals to Nick that she visited NOLA earlier in the year for a funeral , where she danced in a second line parade and vowed to live life to the fullest . That s why that moment meant so much to me , she explains . They go on to have an easy , sweet conversation about her family particularly Rachel s father , who s an intimidating federal judge . How do you think he d respond to , like , you bringing this guy home ? Nick asks . But Rachel does n t get a chance to answer , because the Bachelor perhaps worried that he s tipped his hand a bit too much starts rambling about how nervous he is to meet anyone s parents , since he s already gone through the whole May I have your daughter s hand thing twice before , to no avail . I might be breaking rules here , Nick concludes , but I m super into you . Good boy ! Now give her the rose , silly . Meanwhile , back at the hotel , it s time for the two-on-one reveal . Vanessa , would you please do the honors ? That s right : Josephine , Kristine , Alexis , Raven , Jaimi , Vanessa , Danielle M. , Whitney ( WHO ? ) , Jasmine , and Danielle L. have made the group-date cut , meaning that tonight we might finally get to see Platinum Vagine sent packing . After the group date , of course . Nick meets the ladies at a lovely estate named Houmas House , which is not only a historic mansion but also one of the most haunted houses of all of Louisina , says the Bachelor . Raven , bless her heart , is not having it : If we see a ghost , I m gon na rebuke that thing in the name of Jesus is what I m gon na do , she drawls . I m not puttin up with it . A gentleman named Boo ( a little on the nose , do n t you think ? ) greets the group and gives them the rundown of the house s history and spectral residents including a dead little girl named Mae , who had a spectacularly creepy doll collection . Some of the women are willing to play along , talking about how creepy the place is and how they can feel a presence among them but Jasmine scoffs and boldly picks up Mae s hat and tries it on ( much to Jaimi s chagrin ) . It s unclear how Mae feels about it , though . When Nick and Co. contact Mae via the Ouija board , the spirits confirms that she s in the house â€¦ and the producers turn off the lights . ( Team Bachelor also convinced Boo to pace outside of the house muttering , They touched the dolly ! another nice touch . ) Nick , Raven , and Whitney ( maybe ? ) head upstairs to look for the ghost girl but she s nowhere to be found , nor is her beloved doll . Everyone wanders around in the dark for a bit until Jasmine , fed up , lifts the sheet on the statue the one Boo warned them not to touch , naturally and the moment she does , a chandelier falls from the ceiling , right on cue . By the way , what was under that sheet ? Something truly terrifying : Aww , I m just joshin ya , Corinne ! You enjoy your pre-date rituals bathing , eating enough food to sustain a junior varsity football team , and making up words . No , but that s OK the Bachelor likes to mangle language too . Close enough , I guess . Back inside the mansion , Jasmine and Raven tiptoe into Mae s room , where Jasmine asks the dead young lady to forgive her for touching her hat . Suddenly , objects start falling off the shelf behind her ! Is it the undead , or the Bachelor Interns shaking the bookcase from the darkened corner ? I guess we ll never know . Man , this date is dragging on . Nick , move it along , wo n t you ? Danielle M. ? Sure , sounds good . On to the Battle in the Bayou ! Taylor is feeling confident . I do n t think today is a hard decision for Nick because Corinne and I are two very different people , she says . I do n t have a nanny I have a master s degree in clinical mental health counseling â€¦ If Nick gives Corinne the rose today , he s thinking with his d *** . Girl , you should always assume Nick is always thinking with his d *** . Am I the only one who started to worry at this point that things were n t going to end well for Taylor ? The beefy boat operator drops Nick and his ladies off in the middle of the wooded swampland , where bones and giant bugs await them . But the real romance does n t start until they arrive at a pop-up voodoo ritual , where a priestess and her â€¦ parishioners ? coven ? pals ? Anyhow , everyone s doing their voodoo thing . The priestess leads the trio to a tarot card reader , who is there to bring clarity and light to the situation . Fun fact : This is n t the first time Nick s participated in a producer-mandated tarot card reading . On last season of Bachelor in Paradise , he and his Ms. Right Now , Jen , got a reading on their last date though by the time it aired , Nick had already been announced as the new Bachelor and we all knew Jen was a goner . What fresh hell awaits him this time ? The tarot card lady decides the situation is too tense to do a group reading , so she sends Corinne and Nick away to focus on Taylor first . And what kind of Bachelor villain would Corinne be if she did n t use this time to undermine her rival ? I do feel a little obligated to tell you , there s a situation in the house with me and Taylor , she says . She emotionally attacked me . She basically called me stupid . Nick s response How did that make you feel ? is really odd . Is he a therapist now ? It seems the more useful question would be , What was the argument about ? or What exactly did she say ? But why bother with details when you can make out in the middle of a swamp ? When Nick sits down with Taylor , he does n t waste any time getting to the question at hand : Are you a big ol bully like Corinne says ? If Taylor flat-out denied the accusations that she bullied Corinne and called her stupid , we did n t get to see it . Instead , we hear Taylor give Nick a speech about how he needs someone with emotional intelligence and confidence and she also reveals with a smirk that Corinne did n t know what emotional intelligence meant . Man , as much as we dislike Corinne , the more we see of Taylor , it s clear that she s no trip to Pismo Beach , either . When Taylor returns from her chat with Nick , she finds Corinne sitting alone at the tarot card table playing with her new voodoo doll . I hope that you feel like you used your time with him wisely because you lied to him , Taylor snaps . Not once did I say you were stupid , did I name-call you , and I certainly did not bully you . They bicker back and forth a bit , with Corinne saying it blows her mind that Taylor is a mental health counselor , and Taylor retorting that Corinne s claim that she runs a multimillion-dollar company is equally laughable . Then they sit in frosty silence while Nick makes his way back through the woods . To me it s not about how Taylor and Corinne feel about each other , says Nick . It s about how I feel about these women . And how s that ? Well , a framegrab is worth 1,000 words : Yeppers , Corinne gets the rose . And with that , she and Nick climb back into the boat and leave Taylor to get eaten alive by bugs , gators , and her own inner demons . Actually , scratch that Taylor s not going away just yet . As we all know , this is the part of the process where the dumped two-on-one dater makes some kind of vaguely stalker-y return to speak his/her piece , and that s exactly what Taylor plans to do right after she s finished with this ritual voodoo cleansing . Ahhhh , refreshing . Hey Nick and Corinne , I hope you do n t mind a side of on-camera conflict with your dinner . Oh look our old friend the To Be Continued sign . I guess we ll have to wait until next week to see if Taylor can change Nick s mind or if he ends up sending both her and Corinne home . Post your predictions below ! And be sure to check out Chris Harrison s exclusive blog right here . Now if you ll excuse me , I m going to go make this into a T-shirt . The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC .

Before I begin I want to be sure we take a moment to reflect on the horrific shooting in Florida , \" she said . \" Our continued thoughts and prayers go out to all who were affected by such a senseless act . As a parent I can not imagine the kind of grief and tragedy like that brings . She continued : \" And I hope and I know we all find ourselves wondering what we can do to help ...

Now , Disney has just started to turn its attention to reviving the Indiana Jones franchise after buying the rights from Paramount in 2013 . I m cautioned that while things are very early , I hear the studio has set its sights on Chris Pratt as the swashbuckling archaeologist they hope to build the new franchise around , the role made famous by Harrison Ford in Raiders Of The Lost Ark . Pratt jumped to leading-man movie status with his performance in last year s blockbuster Guardians Of The Galaxy for Marvel and Disney . He starts The Magnificent Seven with Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua in April for MGM and Sony , and there s the inevitable Guardians Of The Galaxy sequel .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This interview for the New Best Friends episode of The Walking Dead contains spoilers . New allies for Alexandria , a special reunion between Daryl and Carol , more Jerry , cobbler , that spiky walker named Winslow , and more proof of the importance of Richonne â€¦ New Best Friends packed a lot of storyline into one episode , and most of it continued the new feeling of hopefulness that Rick and the Alexandrians have started to feel for their future . The Walking Dead showrunner Scott Gimple talked to Yahoo TV about the new bonds formed , the continuing conflicts outside and internal that are holding up Rick s big-picture plan for a war against the Saviors , and gave some hints about the mystery of that as yet unnamed group of survivors who live at the junkyard . Gimple also broke down exactly what motivated Daryl s decision to spare Carol the news about Glenn and Abraham , and told us about how our new favorite TV sidekick Jerry , of course came to be . Both of these first two episodes of the second half of Season 7 have made for a fun way to rejoin Rick and company . It is lovely to hear . Everybody has earned a little bit of fun . We all had to go through a pretty difficult journey , but that s part of a story . Absolutely , especially with all these lighter moments . And Jerry ! I love how much people love Jerry . In many ways , [ the character ] started just when Cooper [ Andrews ] started coming in to audition for stuff . I was just like , We ve got to use him at some point . In the [ comic book ] , Ezekiel s this amazing , huge character , but we did n t see so many people from around the Kingdom . It just seemed that Ezekiel had to have a foil of sorts , and also he needed somebody who makes him look even more kingly to have this unbelievably badass looking guy [ with him ] . It just so happens that he is this unbelievably sweet guy , which kind of punctures the fantasy in moments sometimes . It really does all work together though . Greg Nicotero said one of the things you all really recognized and loved about him , and what helped bring about the character s personality was Cooper s smile . He s this gigantic guy who knows weapons in real life , too very well . Yet he does n t scare me . He makes you happy as soon as he opens his mouth . The Kingdom , at least Ezekiel , is so much about acting a part , and Jerry visually acts the part . He s not as good an actor as Ezekiel . I m not talking about Cooper . I m talking about Jerry . And then there s Richard , Ezekiel s trusted advisor , who agrees with Rick , and who has made some points no one else has especially about the urgency of trying to take on the Saviors . Richard is right in thinking that it probably is going to take something personal to make Ezekiel change his mind , if his mind can be changed . Absolutely , yeah . It s about the people for Ezekiel . Maybe it takes the people being threatened . Maybe it takes a loss to move him into it . I think it does speak to Daryl s state of mind and where he s at , that he seemed to be going along with it until the point that [ he learned ] it was Carol [ who would have to die ] , which is a pretty big thing . It really does reflect that Daryl s not quite the person he used to be . I think what happened in [ Hearts Still Beating ] with portly Joey â€¦ he did n t have to kill Fat Joey . He could have escaped . Who knows ? Maybe Joey would have somehow in that moment betrayed him or compromised his escape , but it did n t look like he needed to do that , and yet he did that . That s a very different thing for Daryl . That is n t who he was . He is very much affected by what happened to him in the Sanctuary , how he was treated and , of course , losing the people that he s lost in the way that he lost them . Is he also motivated out of guilt over the skirmish that happened that was followed by Glenn s death ? Absolutely . I feel a little funny saying that out loud , because that will be served , but I think we ve shown that on the show . I think in [ The Cell ] we showed the guilt side of it with the [ Polaroid ] . He s carrying a great deal of guilt . He did n t know what would happen , and I do n t think it really is his fault , but it feels that way to him . We have that great reunion between Daryl and Carol , and you re thinking , He s going to have to be the one to tell her what s happened to Glenn and Abraham , and he chooses not to . What was his main motivation in deciding to keep that from Carol ? It was unselfish . It does n t follow what he really wants . At the beginning of the episode he said , if she knew what happened to Glenn and Abraham , she d be leading the way to the Sanctuary . He does n t tell her because he knows that she does n t want to get swallowed up in the violence . She does n t want to lose herself . That s why she had to get away , which is what she says . She says it a lot better than I just did . It s unselfish because he sees that she left because she had to , and that this would draw her back . He both spares her joining up , but he also spares her in a way that she can preserve something else â€¦ He allows her her solitude , which he does n t want for her or himself . He d like to have her back . It s an incredibly unselfish thing that he does , what I hope that the audience even sees is heroic in some ways . Related : The Most Romantic ( And Bromantic ) Moments Ever on â€˜ The Walking Dead Morgan says to him later that he knows there s something Daryl s trying to maintain by the fact that he did n t tell her . Is that that Daryl at some level wants to maintain his humanity , and not just for himself , but for his friend , Carol ? That s absolutely it . However hard he s trying to be , however cold he s trying to be , however heartless he s trying to be , he s still a person . That s something that I feel has always been present in that character from the moment Norman walked on the screen , and I think the thing that makes Daryl such a fascinating character is , however believable he is as somebody who can be straight dark and scary , there s always that flicker of humanity . There s always that presence of a human being with an emotional life that very much starts with Norman Reedus and the way he portrays the character . It s something that , however much Daryl tries to extinguish in the character , it looks like he ca n t â€¦ or can he ? We ll find out . When I talked to Andy Lincoln about the midseason premiere , his preview of this episode was that it was going to be bananas . I think the minute you see Winslow , you know exactly what he meant by that . First of all , what should we call this group ? Eventually , the characters call them scavengers . We started calling them that . They had nicknames on set . There were nicknames , I think , on the Internet before . I can spoil a pretty mundane fact that they start calling them scavengers , because that s what they are . They are scavengers , and they are n t talking about them with a capital S , necessarily , but it is what rolled off the tongue because they scavenge . I think Garbage Pail Kids has been the most popular nickname on the Interwebs . I believe that s trademarked , so I can neither confirm nor condone that . Yes , they live in a place called the Heaps . On the set they were calling them the Heapsters . The whole meet-up with them , the junkyard crew , whatever we want to call them , it has at first a very otherworldly , Star Trek Amok Time - meets Mad Max vibe to it . The more we hear Jadis talk , the more we learn about this group , it seems like they may have existed as a very different group even pre-apocalypse . Have they been together longer than the apocalypse ? I would say there s a great deal of mystery with them . Even the way they speak , they give up as little as possible . They use the absolute minimum number of words they need . Do they talk that way to each other ? Maybe . They do n t give out anything , because why should they ? Though I know definitive answers to some of the questions you asked , I would hate to say precisely what they are , because they live in a mystery . Maybe some of those questions will be answered , and maybe they wo n t . I love hearing some of the theory that you just mentioned . I m interested in other people s theories as well . They very much have a little organized society there . I should n t say another word about it . I ll spill it all . It is a good thing that Michonne is there to point out to Rick that he should use the garbage walls to take Winslow down and keep him down . It s another instance of Rick and Michonne working together to this great result . Yes , and it s so important even for the first half . It is very , very much intended that Michonne was a huge part of Rick being able to get to the place where he could picture fighting the Saviors . What Michonne said to Rick is the only way they could do this is together . Yes , the portholes in the [ garbage ] pit enables Michonne to be there . Why do they have portholes in that pit ? Because they have that pit for a reason , but we wo n t talk about the reason . I m glad you noticed that . That s super cool . This introduction of the scavengers also furthers the storyline with Gabriel , and the friendship between Gabriel and Rick . I love that Gabriel plays a huge role in convincing Jadis to listen to Rick and to what they re proposing . And in the end , Rick gives him a lot of the credit for making Rick more open to trusting new people , taking a chance on new people . They re two people who have come to mean a lot to one another and yet their first meeting was not so hot â€¦ that s been a momentum for Rick . That was what he learned with being in Alexandria , like , Oh boy , these people do n t get it , to looking at it as a community and then pooling their strength together . Gabriel s a big part of that , and now it s looking like Rick s only hope is to do this with very , very different people , who he also had a bad initial meeting with . Looking to the rest of the season , Morgan continues to be at odds with his friends , with himself even , about going to war against the Saviors . He did n t want to kill , but he had to in self-defense and defense of Carol . Given that he did kill someone , why is it still so tough for him to not be able to see the big picture with the Saviors and realize they really are in a self-defense place with them , too ? What he put forth was , maybe it is n t just about going right to war . Maybe it s just about holding Negan . He s still hopeful to find other solutions , which is more than where Ezekiel is , but it s less than where Rick is . It really is a question of , Morgan knows that killing brought him to trauma . He can kill . We ve seen him kill and be quite efficient at it . To open up that door for himself , even for others , to be involved in killing and killing and killing and killing , that is n t what human beings were put on earth for , he believes , and it takes something away from them . He is very conflicted . I m sure there s a part of him that s like , You know what ? I wish I could just put my head down and be a soldier , be of service to Rick and sort this out in the ugly way that it probably needs to get sorted out , but he also knows himself . He s unsure whether he will be able to take it . When [ Lennie James ] plays it , we try to not give it too much dialogue , because he s conflicted about both sides . He does n t speak his mind about the avoidance of killing with this ultra-confidence , but it s the only way he sees going forward . There s no pride there . There s hope . There s even a little bit of shame . It s a very human and a very vulnerable thing . It s an incredible tribute to Lennie s unspeakable talent which I am speaking about . The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .",

		"paragraph": "UPDATED WITH WARNER BROS . STATEMENT After 7:19 AM post This has been in the wind for some time , but Henry Cavill will not be reprising his role as Superman in Warner Bros. DC films as others from Justice League such as Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa move forward on their respective superhero features Wonder Woman 1984 and Aquaman . The word has been out that Warner Bros. has been mulling a completely different direction with its Superman canon for some time , even considering casting Michael B. Jordan in the role down the road . But at the present moment a Supergirl movie is the studio s priority as Deadline exclusively broke back in August . Oren Uziel is working on the Supergirl script . According to DC mythology , the character was a teen when she escaped the doomed planet Krypton along with the infant who grew up as Clark Kent . And at this time , there are no other Superman films in development at DC that would include Cavill . The three DC pics he has starred which were directed by Zack Snyder Man of Steel , Batman v.

We have a great relationship and great respect for Henry Cavill that continues to remain unchanged . Additionally we have made no current decisions regarding any upcoming Superman films said a Warner Bros. spokesperson today . The Jersey , Channel Islands native also starred in Warner s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. outside the Superman pics .

Superman ( $ 873.6 M ) .

		"paragraph": "Which famous cop show was produced Lucille Ball s Desilu Productions , created by Columbo co-creators Richard Levinson and William Link , and run by Mission : Impossible creator Bruce Geller ? The classic CBS drama Mannix ( 1967-1975 ) , which starred Mike Connors as the tough , caring , oft-injured Los Angeles private eye Joe Mannix . Mannix , in fact , was knocked unconscious 55 times and shot 17 times during the series run ( according to the 2014 book And Now , Back to Mannix by JoanAnn M. Paul ) , including one gunshot wound to the temple that left him with a case of psychosomatic blindness . Aside from being one of the most violent dramas of its day , Mannix also focused as much on the characters lives as it did on the cases Joe was hired to investigate , a groundbreaking feature that would soon be followed by other hit detective shows , from The Rockford Files to Magnum , P.I. In honor of the new release of Mannix : The Complete Series DVD box set , here are six fun facts about the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning series , including how Lucille Ball helped create and save the show , some of the series most unlikely celebrity guest stars , and the connection between Mannix and â€¦ The Brady Bunch . 1 . Mannix premiered on September 16 , 1967 , and the series will celebrate its 50th anniversary this year . Mannix s eight-season run also makes it the longest-running ever Desilu drama , topping Mission : Impossible s seven seasons , The Untouchables four seasons , and three seasons each for I Spy ( produced by Triple F Productions under the Desilu umbrella ) and Star Trek . 2 . More reasons for Mike Connors to love Lucy : Connors became Joe Mannix after Gary Morton , Ball s second husband and the head of Desilu when Mannix was being developed , saw his cool car . A vintage auto collector , Morton noticed Connors 1937 Bentley convertible outside his office on the Desilu lot when Connors was visiting . The two started talking , and Morton remembered he was looking for the lead for a new detective series , and thought Connors would be perfect . Later , when the show s first season left CBS ready to cancel it , Ball personally went to bat for Mannix , convincing the network to renew the drama as long as changes were made . Joe Mannix went from working for a company called Intertect , which focused on using computers to solve cases , in Season 1 , to being a solo P.I. using his low-tech people and fist-fighting skills in Season 2 , and the show eventually became a Top 10 ratings hit . 3 . Joe had a couple of police friends who helped him on cases occasionally , including Lt. Adam Tobias , played by The Brady Bunch dad Robert Reed . In the Season 3 Mannix episode Who Is Sylvia ? Mannix attended a party at the home of Phil , one of his old Army buddies , and the set for Phil s home was also the set used for â€¦ the Brady family s headquarters . Check out the video below , where you ll recognize that iconic staircase . And yes , that is Jessica Walter playing Phil s wife , Kathy , making for a Mannix-meets-The Brady Bunch-meets-Arrested Development classic TV triple play . But wait , there s more â€¦ in the Mannix Season 6 finale , The Danford File , Mannix attends another cocktail party , once again at a home represented by The Brady Bunch set . This time , the woman of the house is named Laura â€¦ and she s played by Jessica Walter . 4 . In the 1973 Mannix Season 7 episode Little Girl Lost , Joe investigated the murder of a journalist . In the 1997 Season 4 Hard-Boiled Murder episode of the Dick Van Dyke series Diagnosis : Murder , Joe was revealed to be friends with Van Dyke s Dr. Mark Sloane , who helped him suss out the culprit from the murder that happened 24 years earlier in TV land . The sequel episode even included appearances by Little Girl Lost guest stars Pernell Roberts , Julie Adams and Beverly Garland . Connors also appeared as Mannix in the Season 4 Here s Lucy episode Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage , when Joe Mannix saved Lucy from bumbling thieves â€¦ with the help of Lucy and a bottle of ketchup . 5 . As part of the second-season revamp of the show , Mannix hired a secretary to work in his new solo office . Gail Fisher played Peggy Fair , the widow of one of Joe s cop pals . ( The role of Peggy was originally supposed to be played by Nichelle Nichols , but the actress was contractually committed to continue playing Lt. Uhura on that other Desilu production , Star Trek . ) Fisher became the first black actress to win an Emmy in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category in 1970 , and she was the first black actress to win a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Television Series Drama , in 1973 . Connors also took home some awards for his role as Joe Mannix : He won a Golden Globe , as Best TV Actor Drama , in 1970 , and the series won the Globe for Best TV Show Drama in 1972 . 6 . Among Mannix s long list of random guest stars : Neil Young ( performing with Buffalo Springfield in Season 1 s Warning : Live Blueberries ) Neil Diamond ( performing as Neil Diamond in Season 1 s The Many Deaths of Saint Christopher ) Milton Berle ( playing a comedian named Danny Brite in Season 5 s Nightshade ) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ( as a college basketball player named Jeff in Season 4 s A Day Filled with Shadows ) and Lou Rawls ( playing a singer named Vance Logan , who s framed for murder in Season 5 s Lifeline . ) Mannix : The Complete Series is available on DVD from CBS DVD/Paramount .

		"paragraph": "Some of the most iconic settings from Hollywood horror classics belong not to the movie set but to the real world . They are structures . They are landmarks . They may even be somebody s home ( so , be ever mindful of your manners ) . Here s a look at our favorite Halloween sights which you can literally see for yourself . For the 2017 big-screen blockbuster , Hollywood converted this historic 105-year-old Canadian mansion , known as the Cranfield House , into Pennywise s infamous 29 Neibolt St. spook house . While a run-down fa ade was built for the exteriors , the Cranfield was used for interiors . Formerly a home for unwed mothers , the currently unoccupied house ( and soon-to-be condo ) in Toronto s Riverdale neighborhood does a lot of movie work these days , to the annoyance of some neighbors . In Rhode Island , where the reputedly haunted farmhouse that saw its story told in the 2013 hit movie is located , the owners of the Conjuring house are very much over The Conjuring . In North Carolina , where the welcome mat seems to be always out for Hollywood , Pender County s tourism site gives you the address to the 4,840-square-foot single-family home in Currie that stood in for the original possessed house : 405 Canetuck Road . Should you find yourself on the southern shores of Utah s Great Salt Lake , be sure to swing through the township of Magna ( population : 26,505 ) and up to the concert venue known as the Great Saltair . If you re a cult-movie buff , then you ll think you recognize the pavilion s Moorish spires from the bleak 1962 black-and-white film , but you ll be wrong . The Saltair featured in that film burned down in 1970 the current structure ( the third version of the former amusement park site , actually ) was erected in 1981 . In any case , you ll be standing where movie ghouls stood , so â€¦ Score ! Yes , these are exterior facades , and yes , they re located on the Universal Studios backlot , and yes , they ve been nipped and tucked and moved around the lot , but they re included here because they re still the real deal . They were built for Alfred Hitchcock s original Psycho movie and used in sequels thereafter ( though not in the recent Bates Motel series ) , and they re accessible to the public nearly every day via the Universal Studios Hollywood tram tour . The brick house on Prospect Street in the capital s stately Georgetown neighborhood has been called a tourist mecca . In another lifetime , it served as the exterior of poor , possessed Regan MacNeil s home from 1973 s The Exorcist . According to USA Today , the black fence that now surrounds the property was erected to keep the movie-curious public at a distance . In Halloween lore , the franchise slasher hails from Haddonfield , Ill . In real life , Haddonfield does n t exist , and filmmaker John Carpenter shot his original 1978 movie on a shoestring budget in the Los Angeles area , mainly South Pasadena . The key landmark is the Myers family abode , located back in the day on Meridian Avenue and now , after being saved from the wrecking ball and relocated down the road , on Mission Street . Formally known as the Century House , the structure is a local historic landmark and a business office . In Stanley Kubrick s 1980 adaptation of the Stephen King horror classic , Jack Nicholson s writer character lost his mind at Colorado s creepy Overlook Hotel . You might lose your mind too , at the awesome sight of the Pacific Northwest s 55,000-square-foot Timberline Lodge , which appeared in exterior shots as the Overlook . If you want the hotel that inspired King s tale , then you ll want to book a room at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park , Colo . It s long been reported that the townsfolk of Burkittsville were not pleased when the original Blair Witch Project name-checked their humble home and made it a tourist destination even though very little was filmed there . If you visit the village , about an hour s drive east of Baltimore , then please mind your manners and seek out a Welcome sign that s a rare piece of Burkittsville that was actually in Blair Witch . We re afraid the signs do n t look like they did in the 1999 movie . The original ones were , sigh , stolen . The only thing supernatural about Oren Peli s former four-bedroom , two-and-a-half-bath house with a tidy , tidy front yard in San Diego s Rancho Pe asquitos neighborhood is the abundance of good fortune it brought the filmmaker , who shot his 2009 breakout blockbuster here . This imposing 19th-century co-op at Central Park West and 72nd Street in Manhattan s Upper West Side is the famous Dakota . It was already notable for its exclusivity and its tenants , including Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall , when it played the Bramford ( in exterior shots ) in the 1968 demonic hit . In 1980 , the Dakota s legend took a sad real-life turn : John Lennon , who lived in the building with his wife , Yoko Ono , was shot to death at the 72nd Street entrance . ",

Consequently , anticipation is sky-high for his follow-up . And now , we have the first details about that eagerly awaited project . Via that tweet , Peele announced to the world that his next film will be called Us , and as its tagline a new nightmare made clear , Us will be operating in a horror ( or , at least , horror-ish ) vein . Variety later reported that Lupita Nyong o and Elisabeth Moss are in talks to star in the feature , with Black Panther s Winston Duke also being eyed for a prominent role . As with Get Out , Peele will both write and direct the film , which will be produced and distributed by Universal Pictures . The plot of Us is being kept under wraps , with Universal s press release only referring to the film as an original and provocative thriller . Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter in February , Peele claimed that , with his latest endeavor , I m just trying to entertain myself again . â€¦ One thing I know is that this is genre and playing around with the thriller , horror , action , fun genre of intrigue is my favorite . That s my sweet spot . So I think tonally it should resemble Get Out . That said , I want to make a completely different movie . I want to address something different than race in the next one . Speaking about his cinematic inspirations while appearing on Nerdist s podcast Maltin on Movies ( featuring film critic and historian Leonard Maltin and his daughter , Jessie ) , Peele confessed that I want more Hitchcockian tales I want more Brian De Palma I want more Kubrick I want more Spielberg . So I m continuing in the direction of genre . Specifically , I love B-movie premises that are executed in as elevated a way as possible . That s what Jaws is to me . The best movies of all time are that . Alien things that you could read in a pulp magazine . That s Hitchcock , right ? Done with finesse and as much artistry as possible . Given the widespread popularity and acclaim for Peele s Get Out , it should n t be long before more details emerge about Us , which is slated for a 2019 release .

United is one of the main sponsors of the Blackhawks , and the team s home arena is named after the company but there s simply no way this screen-inscribed reminder that the Maple Leafs have n t won a championship in 51 years was ever done in malice . It s certainly just celebrating its history and was in no way reacting to that wild 7-6 Maple Leafs win over the â€˜ Hawks in Chicago over the weekend . I mean , United could never never do something as egregious as making fun of God s hockey team , right ? ",

		"paragraph": "The US labor market stumbled a bit in September . US companies added just 156,000 jobs during the month , missing expectations for 172,000 . Meanwhile , the unemployment rate climbed to 5.0 % from 4.9 % a month ago . Average hourly earnings climbed by just 0.2 % month-over-month , which was weaker than the 0.3 % expected by economists . The increase in the unemployment rate was largely due to 444,000 Americans entering the workforce during the month , bringing the labor force participation rate up to 62.9 % . Below is a look at unemployment rates by demographic : The services sector dominated job creation during the month , with payrolls increasing by 157,000 . Manufacturing jobs fell by 13,000 . Mining and logging , which includes energy production jobs , showed 0 growth . Government jobs fell by 11,000 . Big miss was government , which declined instead of rising , tweeted economist Diane Swonk . While the monthly numbers were a disappointment , the big picture continues to be an encouraging one . Steady growth in aggregate hours and gains in earnings imply solid consumer spending , Renaissance Macro s Neil Dutta said . As economist Justin Wolfers notes , this was the 72nd consecutive month of job gains , which compares to the previous record of 48 months of gains . And for those interested in politics , Wolfers also tweeted that 10.6 million jobs have been created under the Obama administration . As always , these monthly numbers are subject to revisions . Earlier this week , two widely-followed reports on the US economy reflected continued strength in the labor market . First was the ISM non-manufacturing survey , which tracks activity in the US services sector . The employment sub-index surged 6.5 points to 57.2 in September , signaling acceleration in service sector job growth . Second was the Department of Labor weekly report on employment insurance claims . According to the report , the four-week moving average for initial weekly jobless claims fell to 253,500 , which was the lowest level since December 8 , 1973 . This measure has been below 300,000 for 83 consecutive weeks . While these monthly and weekly reports are subject to revisions , the longer term trends hold and continue to reflect a very strong labor market . This puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy with an interest rate hike . The last time the Fed hike rates was December of last year . Forecasters think the next hike could come at the Fed s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting on December 14 . However , there are those who believe a rate hike could come at the November 2 FOMC meeting , despite it being a meeting with no post-meeting Q&A with Fed Chair Janet Yellen .

		"paragraph": "House Republicans unveiled a broad outline on Tuesday for their next phase of tax code changes , which steered clear of correcting technical mistakes from last year s overhaul . The so-called Tax Reform 2.0 legislation was seen as a possible vehicle for technical fixes that would address errors in the 2017 bill . Keeping those corrections out of the proposal underscores how GOP leaders are using it as a messaging tool and want to avoid highlighting problems with the law . The two-page outline , which seeks to make cuts for individuals and some business owners permanent , was released now so Republicans can use it as a talking point as they head back to their districts at the end of the week for August campaigning , said two Republican aides , who requested anonymity . More from Bloomberg.com : Michael Cohen Prosecutors Get 12 Audio Recordings to Review Retailers and restaurants have urged Congress to correct a mistake that prevents them from writing off the costs of renovations right away , while lawyers have said they re concerned that sexual harassment victims wo n t be able to deduct their legal costs as a result of a misplaced word . Those groups may have to wait until after the midterm elections in November , at least , to see some relief . The proposal , which House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady released to committee members on Tuesday afternoon , proposes changes to retirement savings accounts , including creating a new universal savings account and allowing families to access retirement accounts without penalties when welcoming a new child . The framework also expands the uses for money in 529 education accounts . And it would create special tax breaks for startups . More from Bloomberg.com : Trump to Seek Repeal of California s Smog-Fighting Power Read more about how retirement changes are seen as most likely to pass Brady , who will hold listening sessions with House Republicans to gather feedback through August , said Monday that the 2.0 package would include the path forward for technical corrections , without providing details . He told reporters Tuesday that the package will move as three separate bills -- permanency , savings and innovation , to allow the House and Senate to set the right timing and gauge the interest on each of area . More from Bloomberg.com : Trump Weighs Revoking Security Clearances for Several Ex-Obama Officials While House Speaker Paul Ryan has pledged to vote on the legislation , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has only said he ll consider it . Representative Mike Bishop , a Michigan Republican , said GOP lawmakers have been consistently hearing critiques from constituents that the cuts are permanent for corporations but temporary for individuals I wo n t discount that there are politics involved , Bishop said . Representative Richard Neal , the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee , said the effort is insincere because Republicans are n t proposing any provisions to pay for making the individual cuts permanent . The individual and pass-through taxes were set to sunset in 2026 because GOP lawmakers did n t have other revenue raisers to fund permanent reductions . This is never going to see the light of day beyond what the House might or might not do , said Neal . Brady said Tuesday he expects making the individual and pass-through tax changes permanent would cost in the ballpark of $ 600 billion . He did n t specify any measures to offset that expense . The tax 2.0 plan has a slim chance of moving through the Senate , where it would need the support of at least nine Democrats to pass . The 2017 tax law passed without any Democratic votes through a special process called reconciliation . Technical fixes to the tax law could be included in a year-end package after the midterm elections . Democrats are unlikely to support the changes outright , but could vote for a bill that includes change to the law if it includes some tax priorities they favor .

With those four words , uttered by the illustrious Ken Griffey Jr. in the league s new postseason ad , the MLB establishment might have just told us that it s as fed up with the unwritten rules as many fans are . Here s the ad , titled Rewrite the Rules . It ll get you hype for the postseason , you ll geek out at the reveal and it s absolutely needed : For background : The ad includes many of the game s great young stars who are pushing back against baseball s archaic unwritten rules that frown on things like showing emotion on the field , celebrating a home run or flipping a bat . Putting players like Yasiel Puig , Ronald Acu a Jr. , Mookie Betts and Francisco Lindor front and center in the ad is no accident . They represent the new era of baseball players with their swagger and attitude . Particularly in the case of Puig and Acu a , they have a track record of being criticized for not playing the game the right away . Puig , for flipping his bat and wagging his tongue . Acu a , for not wearing his cap straight . And let s be completely clear about this : The ad is an endorsement from MLB of bat flips and celebrations and gasp fun . There was no one better to deliver the message than Griffey , who was the first to challenge the idea that baseball did n t have to keep being the way it always had been . But all these years after Griffeymania kicked down some doors , baseball s old-school ethos just wo n t die . Sixty seconds of video on the internet wo n t fix the entire problem .

One of the best perks about having the Queen as your grandmother-in-law is the access to her royal jewelry box ! Kate Middleton has borrowed several amazing pieces from Queen Elizabeth over the years .

The crowning accessory was the Lotus Flower , the beautiful pearl and diamond tiara headpiece that dates back to Queen Elizabeth s mother in the 1920s .

		"paragraph": "Nike shares saw a bump last week after the company beat expectations on its fourth-quarter earnings report and also announced it would begin selling merchandise on Amazon for the first time . But the talk of the sneaker world is still Adidas . And sneaker collectors and obsessives insist that the biggest reason is Kanye West . The German sportswear giant has made major market-share gains in the last year in US athletic footwear . From May 2016 to May 2017 , according to data from research firm NPD Group , Adidas s US sneaker share nearly doubled , from 6.3 % to 11.3 % . In the same 12 months , Nike s share dipped slightly , as did Jordan Brand s . So , a question arises : is it all thanks to Kanye ? Adidas first signed a design partnership with West in 2014 , stealing him away from Nike . In February 2015 , it released its first Kanye-designed sneaker , the Yeezy Boost 750 , retailing at $ 350 . It put out only 9,000 pairs . Since then , it has only ever released Yeezy shoes in extremely limited supply . Because of that , there s no real sense of sales numbers for Adidas Yeezy products . And because of that ( and other arguments ) , one of the most prominent sneaker industry analysts says that West has n t done much at all to boost Adidas . Matt Powell of NPD Group surely appears more in the media , and is more vocal on Twitter , than any of the other analysts that closely cover Nike , Adidas , Under Armour , and the other major publicly-traded sports apparel companies . And Powell has been unequivocal about West and Adidas : no impact . They paid $ 10 million for nothing , he tweeted in December . That s heresy to the sneakerheads who are certain that the return of Adidas is thanks to what they call the Kanye Effect or Yeezy Effect . Josh Luber , founder of the sneaker resale site StockX , told High Snobiety , It is the success of the Adidas partnership with Kanye West that is contributing to this positive story . Alan Vinogradov , who runs the New York City sneaker convention SneakerCon , says that in the past , almost every attendee at SneakerCon wore Air Jordans . Last year , instead , he noticed more Adidas sneakers than ever . He ascribes it to West . Footwear News has written that the Yeezy line has boosted the resale market , and the TV network Fuse ran a digital miniseries on the Kanye Effect . Powell s reasons for denying the Kanye Effect are mainly : there s extremely limited supply , so there s no sales data to directly suggest West s role in the Adidas comeback and Adidas did not begin to seriously claw back US market share until late 2015 , when West had already been with the brand for nearly two years . If he had the kind of influence people want to bestow on him , Powell says , why did it take two years ? ( As an example of a celebrity sports apparel collaboration that did take hold immediately , he points to Rihanna and Puma . ) The main cause of the comeback , Powell says , is something simpler and more concrete : product . Adidas has made great gains with its Boost line of sneaker technology ( widely praised for their comfort ) , along with Flux and NMDs . it has also refreshed its most classic shoes , the Superstars and Stan Smiths , which fall under its Originals division the part of its sneaker business that has grown the most in the past year . Those in the sneaker world ( many of whom love to reply angrily to Powell on Twitter , and he in turn engages back ) say that it s short-sighted to measure West s helping hand only based on the West shoes . You ca n t credit him only for selling Yeezys , says Brian Quarles , creative director at the agency Revolution . West has been seen wearing other Adidas sneakers in puclic , not just his own , and that makes all Adidas shoes cool among hip-hop lovers and West fans . Indeed , Jonathan Komp , a sneaker analyst at Baird & Co. , has pointed to a halo effect created by the Yeezys on designs like the NMDs . The net effect of all this noise is that it s difficult to argue that West s influence on the popularity of Adidas has been zero . Yet that is Powell s firm belief .

		"paragraph": "In the third episode of Discovery s Manhunt : Unabomber , airing Aug. 8 , we ll again see Ted Kaczynski ( Paul Bettany ) come face-to-face with FBI profiler Jim Fitzgerald ( Sam Worthington ) , the man whose pioneering use of forensic linguistics helped identity him and put him behind bars . Fitz is tasked with trying to convince Kaczynski to enter a guilty plea , but as you see in the exclusive sneak peek above , Kaczynski has his own plan for how this situation should play out . Worthington has called Manhunt a kind of love story between the two men , both struggling to have their ideas heard and accepted . How does Bettany see it ? I think initially it s a pretty one-sided relationship , he says . The thing that Ted , in our story , really respects about Fitz is that Fitz has an imagination . Thinking imaginatively is actually really rare , and he was able to think outside the box , and that s how he catches Ted in our story . I think Ted really found that fascinating because , essentially , [ Fitz ] made up a field of expertise in order to justify a hunt . As the clip reveals , it s the thing Kaczynski admires about Fitz that he needs to discredit . If he can successfully argue that Fitz s new style of analysis , which was used to obtain the search warrant for his cabin , failed to meet the burden of proof , then all of the evidence found there must be thrown out as fruit of the poisonous tree . It s a house of cards because he s invented this field that did n t exist , and he s a nobody . He s got no formal education , Bettany says . Ted should be in prison what he did was monstrous but he had a really good argument that the grounds on which they get the only evidence that condemns him is tainted . The promise that the story would dive into both men s backstories is what interested Bettany in this , his first TV project in 17 years . As he recalls , seven of the eight scripts existed when he signed on , so it was easy for him to see the potential in the series . I think the script does what television does very well , which is drama . Because a script for a movie , by the necessity of it being an hour and a half , becomes a thriller , and also a story about a dogged maverick cop hunting a monster . That would be about as far as you got and had time for , right ? There is nothing wrong with that . I love those sorts of movies , he says . But I do think that this script plays to the strength of what television can do , which is say , â€˜ We re going to spend an episode looking at his domestic life and we re going to see what Ted does at home , and see what his childhood was like , and we re going to see what the toll is on the detective s relationship and his children and what s going on there . ' Viewers will have to wait for Episode 6 to see the hour devoted to Kaczynski s past and the experiences that made him feel so isolated ( and angry ) as a child , teen , and adult . Bettany had access to Kaczynski s unpublished autobiography and the list of outsider novels the FBI found in his cabin . There was Conrad s The Secret Agent , which is about an anarchist trying to build a perfect trigger for a bomb , and Dostoyevsky s Crime and Punishment , and [ Camus ] The Stranger , Bettany says . They re all about men living in a world that they feel alienated from . Bettany tends to live separate from the rest of the cast and crew on film shoots ( I d always rather live in a house than a hotel , he says ) , but this time , he wanted to experience more isolation . I have a wife and children and a whole life , but it was interesting to sort of expand with silence and aloneness . I think the longest I managed was three days without texting or phone calls or email or being online or seeing anybody or talking to anybody , and that was amazing , he says . There s a lot of time in the day to think , and we do n t do that . We re in such constant contact with our cellphones and our computers . I d even turn up on Monday and my voice would be cracking from a lack of use . I just had n t talked to anybody . It s quite interesting . Manhunt : Unabomber airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on Discovery .

She says the library banned Max because someone there is allergic and staffers worried he might get locked in one night . There is also some major construction starting across the street from us on campus , so we felt he now needed to stay in so he would n t get hurt , Lipton says . Media relations manager Barbara K. Laskin agrees . Library staff have generally been able to keep Max out of the building , and although they are animal lovers , they know that not everyone is comfortable with cats and that some people are seriously allergic to them , she tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Most of all , everyone wants to make sure Max is safe and well . She says Schommer replaced boring signs advising the students to watch out for Max with the fun , illustrated one . This was n t OK with Twitter users who after seeing the flier hopped on #TeamMax . Some even started the hashtag #LetMaxIn . McGuire s original tweet with the poster of Max got more than 25,000 retweets and caused a cat-astrophic movement around Max and his library rights , or lack thereof . In addition to sticking up for Max , many people have turned Max the Cat and the library into a children s story and shared some sections in tweets . Some even made him his own library card to bypass the system . Macalester art student Mariah Sitler created a comic for him . In reality , a DeWitt library patron pointed out that the stories about Max are way more exciting than the real-life situation . What shenanigans does Max get up to ? one person asked . Well , mostly he just blocks the door to the library and tries to run in as soon as someone opens the door , Research and Instruction Librarian in the Fine Arts and Humanities department Alexis Logsdon responded . The legend of Max might end up being a LOT more fun than the real Max . ) As it currently stands , Max is grounded and , according to Lipton , is very sad about it . But he may be able to interact with the students again sooner rather than later . We are going to train him hopefully , to walk on a leash so we can take him to campus to see his fans , she says . We may also get him trained as a therapy cat so he can go to schools and make other students happy too . Lipton says the attention has been overwhelming , but she s happy her cat has brought so many people happiness . Thanks , Max the Cat !

		"paragraph": "President Donald Trump delivered a threat to foreign leaders during a press conference Saturday at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec , Canada : If they do n t dramatically reduce tariffs and trade barriers , we 'll stop trading with them . Halting all trade with countries that do n t drop tariffs is a very profitable answer , Trump said . Trump also repeated an earlier proposal that U.S. trading partners should drop all trade barriers , including tariffs and subsidies to industries and producers in their own countries . We 're the piggy bank that everybody is robbing . And that ends , Trump said . The comments come in the midst of Trump s ongoing trade war with allied nations . In the weeks leading up to the summit , he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada , Mexico , and the European Union . Trump has also maintained his stance that tariffs are a national security issue , because unfair trade deals affect our military , he said . Over the course of the summit , the President pushed the narrative that the U.S. is a victim of a trade imbalance , though European leaders rejected these claims . Trump , in a Twitter tirade on Thursday , pointed fingers at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French president Emmanuel Macron , stating that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers . In his tweetstorm -- and again on Saturday -- the President said that such actions were hurting U.S. farmers and killing our agriculture . According to Trump , who blamed the U.S. leaders who preceded him for the current trade deficits , the answer is a change in the entire international trading system . You got to go tariff free , he argued . We have a tremendous trade imbalance , Trump said during Saturday s press conference . With one country we have $ 375 billion in trade deficits . He later added , It s going to stop . See original article on Fortune.com More from Fortune.com",

		"paragraph": "After a marriage ends and you ve gained some time and distance from the relationship , you can slowly start to see where things went wrong . As they say , hindsight is 20/20 . Your own mistakes and shortcomings things you did or did n t do , things you said or did n t say come into plain view , hopefully offering important lessons to be carried into your future relationships . We asked divorced men to share some of the things they wish they had done differently while they were still married . Here s what they told us : Even before we started sleeping in separate rooms , we did n t go to bed together . And I do n t mean we stopped having sex , I mean we did n t go to sleep at the same time . I would stay up late and decompress watching my favorite show and she would go to bed at what I thought was a crazy-early bedtime . I ve learned there is a special kind of closeness to be nurtured by ending your day together . Snuggling up and letting the day wash over one another and speaking fleeting thoughts is a bond we should all aspire to have . Adam Petzold My greatest regret from the beginning of my divorce three years ago through today is not trying a little harder before things got to the point of divorce . I became complacent , distant , and stopped caring . While divorce was the right choice for us in hindsight , I regret letting it get to that point . Yes , we were unhappy in our marriage , but my children and â€˜ normal family life will never be the same , and just maybe I could have prevented that . Derick Turner There are so many things I realize I could have done better , but if I had to choose just one , it s that I kept quiet about any regrets I had . Whether it was something serious , like moving in together before I was ready , or something less intense , like eating her broccoli rabe even though it made me gag , it somehow felt disloyal to share my ruefulness . In hindsight , though , I see that expressing my true feelings would have been honest . And marriages are nothing without honesty . Immediately explaining your disappointment with a personal decision makes you transparent , and allowing your partner to see what you wish you could do over can solidify your bond . Meanwhile , keeping quiet about your regrets demonstrates a lack of trust that ultimately tears apart a relationship . Craig Tomashoff I would n t have gotten married at such a young age . Quite simply , I had no idea who I was yet so being â€˜ true to myself would have been impossible . I married at a very young age and I was still trying to find my true north . Due to many childhood issues from the family I grew up in , my emotional wiring was already a bigger mess than I knew . In many ways , stepping into my early 20s , my soul carried on more like a civil war than the compass it should have been for my life . Because of the environment I was raised in , I learned very early in life how to pretend everything was OK . This was both unhealthy for me emotionally and completely unfair to my young wife at that time . As the years passed , I began to understand who I was and what parts of me were never going to change . Honestly , we both grew up into the people we were destined to be . And those people made far better friends than partners in a relationship . Michael Cheshire I wish that I would have been more transparent about my challenges as a man , as a father and as a husband . I kept negative thoughts and fears stuffed deep inside , which did nothing positive for either of us . I wanted the best for her and for us , but keeping her sheltered from the downsides was not the right way . She thought all was good , and I d isolated myself emotionally . A truly solid relationship relies on open communication without fear of retribution . One must love and respect their own self as well as their partner , which includes openly divulging fears and challenges . Bill Douglas When we were first married , my ( now ex - ) wife supported us while I was struggling to get started in my career . Because of that , I deferred to her and took a backseat as far as our decision-making . When things worked out and I began doing really well , I expected to have a more equal role . But it was not to be . That original dynamic was baked in , and she remained fairly dominant . Totally my fault I lacked the strength early on to assert my value and role in our relationship , regardless of financial contribution . I doubt it would have changed the eventual outcome , but it might have been a more enjoyable ride ( at least for me ) while we were together . Barry Gold , author of Gray Divorce Stories Divorce was a painful wake-up call for me . It was only then that I got to be honest with how I really showed up ( or did n t show up ) for my wife . When I look back , there are thousands of mistakes I made over 16 years . Most of them were small . A few were big , but the mistake that cost me the most was my inability to really listen . I did n t get that my wife s greatest need was to feel heard , validated and understood . Instead , every time she was upset I would either get defensive , try to fix it , or walk away and avoid her , hoping she would get over it . What I did n t realize at the time was how much my pride and inability to understand her point of view cost us in terms of intimacy and trust . I really believe that if I could have just been able to be present with her and more respectful of her feelings , we could have made it through all the other ups and downs . But because I did n t really make her my biggest priority , I ended up losing her forever . Gerald Rogers My biggest regret is my lack of self-awareness and poor communication skills . I never stopped to figure out why I felt how I felt , said what I said , or did what I did . I operated in the relationship reactively , and you just ca n t do that or you will have the same issues over and over . It was n t until I worked on learning how to communicate effectively and be self-aware that I fully realized my contribution to the downfall of what we had . It may not have lasted anyway , but certainly a lot less damage would have been done and the latent resentments and animosity could have been curbed quite a bit . When you are n t self-aware and do not communicate well , things devolve into a power struggle of whose needs are more important and whose are not being met , and you simply ca n t resolve that without either .

		"paragraph": "2ND UPDATE : The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed Tuesday that a bullet from an officer s gun killed Trader Joe s assistant manager Melyda Corado during Saturday s shootout with a murder suspect outside the Silver Lake store . LAPD Chief Michel Moore said in a press conference today that Corado was hit as she exited the store s front doors during the exchange of gunfire . She went back inside and collapsed behind a counter . She was eventually pulled out by employees , but could not be revived . I know that it s every officer s worst nightmare to hurt an innocent bystander during a violent engagement , Moore said . I spoke with the officers this morning they re devastated . They were devastated in the immediate aftermath of this event . The suspect , Gene Atkins , who was being pursued by police after allegedly shooting his grandmother . He and the LAPD exchanged gunfire after he crashed into a light pole outside the store during a pursuit , before entering and beginning what ended up being a three-hour standoff . Atkins will be arraigned today after the Los Angeles District Attorney filed more than 30 counts against him including murder and six counts of attempted murder . Bail was set at $ 9 million . UPDATED , SUNDAY AM : The gunman who took hostages at a Silver Lake Trader Joe s and got into a shootout with police has been identified as Gene Evin Atkins , age 28 . Atkins was booked in the Los Angeles County jail on suspicion of murder because of the death of Melyda Corado , a manager at the Trader Joe s who was killed in an exchange of gunfire between Atkins and police . He could be arraigned as early as Monday and will likely face additional charges , a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said . He is being held on $ 2 million bail . LAPD Chief Michel Moore told the Los Angeles Times that Corado was killed when she exited the store during the shootout . Moore said it is not clear whether police or Atkins fired the fatal shot . Atkins himself was wounded in the arm during the exchange . The Silver Lake Trader Joe s store remained closed on Sunday . Yesterday marks the saddest day in Trader Joe s history as we mourn the loss of one of our own , the company s statement reads . Atkins shot his grandmother to start the incident that led to the Trader Joe s standoff . She is in stable condition at a local Los Angeles hospital . She has been identified as Mary Elizabeth Madison . 2ND WRITETHRU , 8:20 PM : A woman was killed during a three-hour standoff at the Trader Joe s in Silver Lake that played out on live TV and ended with a suspect taken into custody . Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference that the woman was shot inside the store but did not provide further details . Our officers rescued that woman from inside and attempted to render aid with the assistance of LA Fire , but unfortunately were unable to revive her , LAPD Chief Michel Moore said later at the news conference . Asked if he knew who shot the woman inside the store , Garcetti said , No information right now , sorry . Multiple local TV news stations and CNN were live on the scene of the standoff . Police had cordoned off multiple blocks around the store on Hyperion Avenue near Los Feliz Boulevard and Rowena Avenue and told news crews at the scene not to show the market on live TV as they assessed the situation . Garcetti later thanked the media for cooperating with that request . Several hostages were seen exiting the store while LAPD crisis negotiators communicated with the suspect , who had answered his cellphone . He ended up handcuffing himself inside the store and was taken into custody without incident . Police said it remains an active investigation and that the area will remain closed as the investigation continues . Garcetti said there about 40 or 50 people inside initially and that a steady stream of hostages either escaped during the incident , were rescued by officers or released by the gunman . Moore said the incident began at about 1:30 PM on 32nd Street in South L.A. when the suspect shot his grandmother as many as seven times and fled in her car . He dragged an unidentified second woman into the grandmother s 2015 Toyota Camry sedan and took off in it . Hollywood-area officers located the car using LoJack and began a pursuit that led to northeast area of L.A. During the course of that pursuit , Moore said , the gunman inside fired on our officers multiple times . The chase ended when he struck a power outside the Trader Joe s . There are shell casings we believe from the suspect s weapon in the middle of the street , Moore said , but as the suspect exited the vehicle , an additional gun ensued between the officers and the suspect . He said the suspect was wounded in the left arm but went into the store , which was crowded with Saturday afternoon shoppers and numerous employees . Inside the store , a young woman was shot and killed , Moore said . He said identify had not yet been confirmed .

Additionally , the gunman released a number of hostages . Garcetti said the suspect s grandmother was undergoing surgery at a local hospital and was critical but alive . The younger woman also was shot , but Moore said it was unclear whether that happened earlier or during the pursuit . Police did not update the condition of that victim nor did they disclose her relationship to the suspect .

		"paragraph": "We do n t know what causes people to become killers . There are theories , but many murderers have a stark pattern : they abuse women . This link is well-documented . The Golden State Killer , unmasked as Joseph James DeAngelo , fits this pattern , as new information about him has revealed . DeAngelo is said to have had a volatile relationship with his estranged wife , Sharon Huddle . An anonymous neighbor told the Mercury News that he could hear DeAngelo and Huddle screaming at each other DeAngelo even yelled at her from the driveway outside the home . The neighbor called their arguments epic and said that the family was an unstable household . To be clear , there is no evidence of physical domestic violence in this portrait of DeAngelo and Huddle . Ostensibly , investigators are still constructing a profile of his life , so reports of domestic violence may come out later , but current reports do indicate that he was emotionally abusive towards his wife . DeAngelo was also reportedly obsessed with an ex-fianc e named Bonnie . He apparently proposed to Bonnie , but for unknown reasons , they never married . One of his rape victims told police that after he attacked her 1976 , he yelled I hate you , Bonnie , and cried into a pillow . Police were stymied about the identity of Bonnie until DeAngelo was caught and investigators pieced together his history . Such behavior has been documented with other killers . Omar Mateen , who murdered 49 at the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016 , was physically abusive towards his wife , Sitora Yusufiy . Devin Patrick Kelley , who killed 26 people at a church in Texas last year , was court-martialed and dishonorably discharged from the Air Force for beating his wife and cracking their baby s skull . It s not just mass shooters or serial killers that have a history of domestic violence . Garden-variety domestic murderers are overwhelmingly male and their victims are overwhelming their female partners . The Atlantic , citing a 2017 report from the Centers for Disease Control , found that 55 % of women murdered were killed by former and current partners or their families . Of that pool , 93 % of those victims were killed by an intimate current or former romantic partner . 30 % of the time , the couple had argued right before the murder . We found that approximately one in 10 victims of intimate-partner-violence-related homicide experienced some form of violence in the preceding month , said Emiko Petrosky , a CDC official , to NPR regarding this report . These statistics should ring alarm bells . Scientific and anecdotal data shows a clear link between domestic violence and homicide of many types . If we want to prevent mass shootings and serial killing sprees , as well as intimate partner violence , we should look in the home first . We need to acknowledge that toxic masculinity , abuse , and homicide go hand in hand . When men are taught to react to situations with unbridled anger , that anger leads to violence . We know this , we see it every single day . Men who abuse women describe feeling enraged , with insecurity as a trigger . Our culture demands that men be tough , emotionally hardened , and ready to use violence to achieve a goal . That dangerous combination leads to abuse and , in some men , homicidal behavior . It s upsetting to see so many reports of domestic violence in the history of killers . We can clearly see a moment where intervention could have saved lives . Had the abuser been incarcerated or monitored by police , it s possible that they could have stopped the killer before they killed . The #MeToo movement implores us to listen to women , to believe women , and to defend women . Women like Yusufiy and Huddle endured violence that they never should have and law enforcement did nothing to protect them . In both cases , the culturally pervasive indifference towards violence against women had deadly consequences for many other people . If you are experiencing domestic violence , please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or TTY 1-800-787-3224 for confidential support .

		"paragraph": "When it comes to making decisions about your money , you may be looking for some extra help . That s where a financial advisor comes in . Whether you re a seasoned investor or someone in the beginning stages of your financial life , a financial advisor can help you manage your money and reach your financial goals . But the first step is finding the perfect fit . Kimberly Palmer , a credit cards and banking expert for NerdWallet.com , shared her advice for how to choose the right financial advisor . When do you need a financial advisor ? Palmer says a big myth about financial advisors is that you need to be wealthy to hire one . In reality , advisors can help people at all financial levels , and can provide an important perspective when it comes to your finances . Sometimes you face a point where you feel like , ok , I need an outside perspective , and it s often when you ve gone through something really big , [ like ] launching a business , or maybe you ve gone through a divorce , or something that has really upended your finances , Palmer said . People should also consider hiring an advisor to help them reach financial goals they may be working towards if they re not making enough progress on their own . Maybe you re trying to pay off debt or save to buy a home and you just feel stuck , she said . Are you self-disciplined enough to make your own budget and follow it , or do you need an outside coach who s in your corner helping you ? How to find the right fit As your first step , Palmer recommends asking friends and family for referrals or recommendations , since they may have similar financial concerns or challenges . Palmer also recommends using a resource like the National Association of Personal Finance Advisors ( NAPFA ) , which allows you to filter advisors by specialty and location . It s a great resource to go to if you do have a special concern , like running a small business , she said . When it comes to credentials , an advisor may be a CFP , or Certified Financial Planner . This means they ve taken a course in financial planning , passed an exam , and have at least three years of financial planning experience . Not all financial advisors are required to have a CFP certification , and there are a variety of other licenses and certifications financial professionals can receive . Palmer says you should understand and educate yourself on their qualifications before you hire them to help you with your finances . The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has a complete list of financial professional designations and what they mean . Once you find someone you may want to work with , Palmer says you should run a web search on their name , research their credentials and even call to ask if you could speak with their other clients . You re really doing your due diligence to make sure you re going to work with someone you can really trust , she said . Calling your advisor Once you think you ve found a fit , Palmer says the first thing to ask is how your advisor will be paid . Because there s such a variety of ways you can pay an advisor , that s an area where people tend to get stuck and confused , so you always want to ask and make sure you understand , she said . Palmer said advisors can be paid by fee-only , which means they will be paid based on the time they spend with you , or from a percentage of the assets they re helping you manage . Another option is commission-based , which means they re paid based on the products and services they re selling to you . Palmer said no one payment structure was better than the other , but it s important to understand how you ll be billed so there are no surprises . Palmer also recommends asking your potential advisor what their communication style is : will you meet with them once a year , or keep in contact through email or social media . You want to really find an advisor who matches your communication style so you feel like you re in tune with them , she said . You should n t feel intimidated to call them and ask them a question . Meeting your advisor If you think you ve found the perfect fit , you should ask your advisor for a free first meeting . Especially for someone in their 20s or 30s who does n t have a ton of assets accumulated already , this can be something you ask for : Will you talk with me free of charge as I m choosing an advisor ? she said . Palmer says this meeting is often less about money and more about identifying your financial goals . That can be something that s not too intimidating or overwhelming because you re really talking about those big picture things , she said . Where do you hope to be in one year , in five years ? Once you start working with your advisor on a professional basis , Palmer says you can expect to pay around $ 200 an hour for their services .

		"paragraph": "Stock futures edged lower during early trading Wednesday , with all three major indices receding after posting their best day since March on Tuesday . Futures for the S&P 500 ( ^ GSPC ) fell 0.45 % , or 12.75 points , while Dow futures ( ^ DJI ) slipped 0.53 % , or 137 points , as of 8:33 a.m. ET . Nasdaq futures ( ^ IXIC ) fell 0.56 % , or 41 points . The pullback in equity futures comes ahead of the release of the Federal Open Market Committee s September meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon . The minutes will help contextualize the decisions the committee made to drop accommodative language in its September statement and raise the target funds rate to between 2 and 2.25 % , as was widely expected . President Donald Trump continued to assail the Federal Reserve this week , calling the central bank my biggest threat in an interview released Tuesday on FOX Business . Trump last week said that he thought the Fed is going loco over raising interest rates and reiterated that he believes the Fed is tightening monetary policy unnecessarily in light of recent economic indicators pointing to muted inflation . Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that the central bank will not be swayed by political pressures . The central bank raised interest rates three times this year and is expected to make a fourth rate hike before the end of 2018 . New home building fell 5.3 % to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.201 million in September , the Commerce Department said in a statement Wednesday . This fell short of average economist expectations of 1.21 million housing starts for September , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . Building permits which point to future home building slipped 0.6 % to 1.241 million after falling 4.1 % to an upwardly revised 1.249 million in August . Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) gained 10 % in early trading Wednesday after the internet streaming giant reported new user growth that surged past expectations . Netflix reported after market close Tuesday that it added nearly 7 million new streamers for the period ending September 30 , versus the company s own estimates of an additional 5 million streamers for the quarter . The company also delivered earnings per share of 89 cents versus Wall Street estimates of 68 cents , on revenue of $ 4 billion . The earnings beat led several major firms to boost their 12-month price targets for the stock . Morgan Stanley reversed its price target to $ 475 per share from $ 450 per share on Wednesday , after having cut its price target just a day earlier . IBM ( IBM ) beat on earnings per share for the quarter but missed on revenue , sending shares tumbling in early trading . Earnings came in at $ 3.42 per share , excluding certain items , exceeding analysts average estimates of $ 3.40 per share . However , revenue came in under at $ 18.76 billion , versus expectations of $ 19.10 billion , on account of revenue shortfalls from areas including IBM s Cognitive Solutions , Technology Services and Cloud Platforms segments . The stock was down 4.5 % as of 8:29 a.m. ET Wednesday . Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) gained more than 2 % in early trading after CEO Elon Musk said he plans to purchase $ 20 million of Tesla common stock at the next open trading window , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Musk is the largest shareholder of Tesla s stock and held more than 33 million shares prior to the latest announcement . The same filing detailed Tesla and Musk s recent settlement with the SEC , which was approved by a federal judge earlier this week . Canada became the first G7 nation to legalize recreational marijuana Wednesday . The legal age for use will be 19 in most provinces . In Canada s most populated province of Ontario , residents will only be able to order cannabis online until retail stores open next spring . Beyond decriminalizing marijuana use , the legalization of recreational use in Canada opens up the budding cannabis industry to regulation , allowing the government to tax and monitor the industry .

		"paragraph": "From Country Living Today , the royal family broke the amazing news that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their first child . The craziest part , though , is that Meghan actually gave a major pregnancy clue three weeks ago that you might have missed . On September 24 , Meghan and Harry made an appearance at the Coach Core Awards at Loughborough University . Meghan 's hair , which she usually wears curly or in a bun , was pin straight , with ( it looks like ) some very fresh layers . Take a look . We combed through 60 + pages of the latest pictures of Meghan and found she has n't worn her hair like this since at least before her wedding to Prince Harry . This is her usual style : You may be thinking ... what 's the big deal about this ? So the girl changed her hair ... . But , there 's something important to note here . When Kate Middleton announced her third pregnancy , one reporter noticed a very subtle pattern . And the internet latched on , using pictures as evidence . Here 's Kate about two months before her most recent pregnancy reveal , looking totally normal . Then , here she is one month before the reveal , sporting a new chop . Taking it back a little further , here she was in the summer of 2014 two months before the news of baby Charlotte was announced . Totally normal hair . The signature style . But here 's a photo of her just one month before the Charlotte news hit , and media pointed out that she was \" embracing her roots \" more than ever . It 's possible she just skipped a colorist appointment and this was totally unintentional , but it could still be part of a pattern . Here 's the most compelling evidence of all . One month before the Prince George news , Kate was wearing her perfectly blown out brown curls as per usual . But then , only a week or two before they announced the pregnancy , she shocked the world by getting bangs . ( Bangs are not subtle ! ) People were so preoccupied that the announcement of Prince George 's existence on Dec. 3 was a slight shock to the masses . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

		"paragraph": "Medal count | Olympic schedule | Olympic news RIO DE JANEIRO This is a new feeling for Kerri Walsh Jennings . After 26 straight victories in Olympic beach volleyball , the 38-year-old American sports icon lost a match , to Brazil s Agatha and Barbara in the semifinals on Tuesday night . After an unprecedented run of three straight gold medals , she will play for a bronze . How does it feel ? It s a terrible feeling , she said . Good answer , assured her partner , April Ross . This is also a new feeling for the millions of fans Walsh Jennings has helped cultivate in the last 12 years while becoming one of the most successful American Olympians of all-time : Seeing her discuss a loss . Hearing her criticize her own efforts in defeat . How did that sound ? Well , she did n t call her opponents cowards , if that s what you re asking . That s where the bar is set for sportsmanship at the Rio Olympics , thanks to U.S. women s national soccer team goalie Hope Solo s petulant assessment of the Swedish team that eliminated them calling them a bunch of cowards because they did n t want to play great soccer . Walsh Jennings ? There are pole-vaulters who could n t clear that bar as well as she did . You have to pass the ball to win matches and I do n t know how many aces they got . Four per game maybe , on me ? That s unacceptable and inexcusable , she said . I ve been served aggressively this whole tournament . And you ca n t do anything without a pass . That s what set the tone , and we did n t get our mojo on anything else . To reset for a moment : This is a world class athlete . An icon . Someone that young volleyball players around the world honor with posters in their rooms . Someone trying to claim her fourth gold medal . And she blamed this devastating two-set loss on herself while praising her opponents , who victimized her rocky performance by targeting her on serves . As they should , she said . I was n t passing the ball . You see weakness , you go after it . My weakness tonight was passing the ball . And then we never gave ourselves breathing room . When you re shanking balls , and you re up a point or two and you shank a ball â€¦ Walsh Jennings paused . We can squash that team . We have in the past . I say that with so much respect for them . They re very , very good . Tonight , they rose to the occasion . I certainly did not . There s no excuse for it . Just terrible execution . They outplayed us pretty much in every way . Not out-hustled us , not out-hearted us , not out-teamworked us . Just outplayed us . Walsh Jennings was n t good in their semifinal loss . Frankly , she was bad the kind of bad that s uncomfortable to watch , because it s so out of character and because it s happening at the most crucial time . Balls would bounce off her hands and out of bounds . Routine plays were becoming inexplicable adventures . I envisioned them coming at me and I envisioned hitting every pass . I was just too quick with the ball . I just need to hold onto my platform a little bit more . I ve learned this lesson the hard way , many , many times . Our coaches have trained us not to do that , she said . So to go to the finals of the Olympic Games and do that is absolutely devastating . Combine that with a deafeningly loud crowd of local fans and smart , efficient play from Agatha and Barbara , and it proved to be too much for the Americans . We know we had to fight with a three-time gold medal winner . We know she wanted a fourth , said Agatha , through an interpreter . She wo n t get one . Medal count is one way you measure an athlete . Stats are another . But there are also less empirical measurements . Like , for example , how they carry themselves after a victory and , especially , how they do the same after a defeat . We ve known Kerri Walsh Jennings to be an all-time great numerically and based on her trophy case . We ve seen her be gracious in victory . And while we might have expected she d react as she did to her first Olympic defeat , there s something validating to have that expectation confirmed . How many athletes that could realistically claim to be the best in the world at what they do would throw around words like unacceptable and inexcusable and terrible about themselves , with nary an ill word spoken about her opponents or officiating or the booing fans or a dozen other potential straw men ? How many stars can mix confidence with culpability and have it sound genuine ? Not many . Which is what makes Kerri Walsh Jennings a success even in defeat . So how about one more run at that fourth gold medal ? I know I can , I do n t know if I will . I want to fix my match tomorrow and go home with a bronze medal , she said . We d expect nothing less .

		"paragraph": "Kurt Busch held off Kyle Larson over the final 13 laps at Bristol to win his first race since the 2017 Daytona 500 on Saturday night . Busch got to the lead by beating teammate Clint Bowyer on the previous restart . He dashed past Bowyer again on the final restart and built a gap on Larson over the final 13 laps that Larson and his fresher tires could n t overcome . Busch was a guarantee to make the playoffs without the win as he entered the race fourth in the points standings . But now he s in with a win and , more importantly , five more bonus points and can go for broke over the final two races of the regular season . His race was almost overshadowed by the drive his brother Kyle had . Kyle Busch spun not long after the race went green and collected a ton of cars behind him including Kurt . Kyle went two laps down but got the laps back and made his way up to second late in the race before pit stop issues put him back in the field . Kyle Busch s car could n t get full of fuel because of the damage from the early wreck . Kyle Busch brought out the race s final caution as well with a spin because of a flat tire . Contact while racing three-wide with Chris Buescher and Jimmie Johnson cut Busch s left-rear tire and caused the spin . Larson started on the pole and looked like he had the best shot to beat Kurt Busch over the final laps . But he never got close enough to even attempt a pass after he took second . Bowyer restarted second on the final restart but got a horrible launch and stacked up the bottom line . As Kurt Busch did a burnout following his first post-race interview with NBC he did it with the checkered flag on the hood of the car and his helmet on top of the car . Whoops . The win is Kurt Busch s first at Bristol since his win in the 2005 spring race and his sixth at the track overall . He had won five of his first 10 Bristol starts but was in the midst of a 12-year winless streak entering Saturday night s race . Here are the full results from Bristol . 1 . Kurt Busch 2 .

		"paragraph": "( BRIDGEWATER , N.J. ) President Donald Trump said Sunday he d be willing to shut down the government if Democrats refuse to vote for changes he seeks to the U.S. immigration system , including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border . I would be willing to â€˜ shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security , which includes the Wall ! Trump tweeted . Must get rid of Lottery , Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT ! We need great people coming into our Country ! Trump said . Trump campaigned on the promise of building a border wall to deter illegal immigration . Congress has given him some funding but not as much as he has requested . Trump also wants changes to legal immigration , including scrapping a visa lottery program . In addition , he wants to end the practice of releasing immigrants caught entering the country illegally on the condition that they show up for court hearings . Trump has also demanded that the U.S. shift to an immigration system that s based more on merit and less on family ties . Democrats and some Republicans have objected to some of the changes Trump seeks . The federal budget year ends Sept. 30 , and lawmakers will spend much of August in their states campaigning for re-election in November . Trump would be taking a political risk if he does , in fact , allow most government functions to grind to a halt on Oct. 1 the first day of the new budget year roughly a month before the Nov. 6 elections , when Republican control of both chambers of Congress is at stake . House Republicans released a spending bill this month that provides $ 5 billion next year to build Trump s wall , a major boost . Democrats have long opposed financing Trump s wall but lack the votes by themselves to block House approval of that amount . But they have the strength to derail legislation in the closely divided Senate . Without naming a figure , Trump said in April that he would have no choice but to force a government shutdown this fall if he does n t get the border security money he wants . The $ 5 billion is well above the $ 1.6 billion in the Senate version of the bill , which would finance the Homeland Security Department . The higher amount matches what Trump has privately sought in conversations with Republican lawmakers , according to a GOP congressional aide who was n t authorized to publicly talk about private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity . Two leading Democrats Reps. Nita Lowey of New York and California s Lucille Roybal-Allard called the $ 5 billion a waste that only further enables this administration s obsession with cruel attacks on immigrants . Separately Sunday , Trump tweeted that there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally and claimed that many who do so are using children for their own sinister purposes . Trump s tweet came several days after the government said more than 1,800 children separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under Trump s zero-tolerance immigration policy have been reunited with parents and sponsors . A federal judge had ordered the reunions to be completed by last Thursday but hundreds of children remain separated . The administration says some of their parents have criminal histories . Please understand , there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally , whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes , Trump said . He also said Congress must fix the DUMBEST & WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world ! and urged voters to Vote â€˜ R ' in November .

		"paragraph": "Donald Trump has continued to tout the surging stock market ( ^ GSPC ) , which continues to flirt with new highs each day , ever since he took office . But over that same period , the US Dollar has continued a steep downtrend . Economists say there are two key reasons behind the plummeting dollar : Trump and the Fed . Following Trump s inauguration , there were high hopes for fiscal action in the US , Societe Generale analysts said , which would give the economy a boost . As shown in the chart below , the dollar rose significantly following Trump s November 2016 election in anticipation of progress on items like infrastructure reform and tax reform . But with increasing signs of discord , expectations have lessened and the dollar has sold off , as can be seen in the move in the currency since the January inauguration and continuing recently as agenda items get pushed off further . Uncertainty sparked most recently by distractions , a long agenda list for Congress , and confusion around the future of key players behind the proposals like economic adviser Gary Cohn have added to existing question marks . And some of the uncertainty and delays surrounding the Trump agenda could be contributing to the recent slower pace of rate hikes at the Fed , according to Societe Generale . To put this in context , the dollar had a strong run for six years , as shown below . This was largely driven by strong economic performance in the US following the 2008 recession but then propelled significantly higher in 2015 when the US became the first central bank to talk about tightening ( raise rates ) . However , since then , two things have happened . First , the pace of tightening in the US has been slower than originally anticipated . At the time of the first rate hike in the US in December 2015 , the Fed projected four hikes in 2016 . We ended up getting just one . In December 2016 , it projected three hikes in 2017 . We have gotten only two with now minimal expectations for another before the end of the year . Second , other central banks have gotten more aggressive about tightening policy . The rest of the world has n t been standing still , according to Societe Generale s Kit Juckes . In fact , the Bank of Canada has hiked rates twice this year , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has communicated its intent to wind down asset purchases , and the Bank of England has also started to talk about rate hikes soon . In other words , the policy divergence ( US in tightening mode while rest of the world not ) that was supporting the dollar through the first quarter of this year has ended . After growing at a modest rate of 2.1 % in 2012-16 , we expect the US economy to slow to 1.7 % over 2017-21 . That may be better than the average of the developed economies â€¦ but it s not enough to get us excited about the currency , Juckes wrote . President Trump s political honeymoon is well and truly over , the current account deficit is growing again , and higher rates elsewhere will increasingly compete for global capital flows . The bottom line : While the stock market is surging , the chart of the dollar is telling a very different story . And it comes back to expectations for the Fed and Donald Trump .

		"paragraph": "The explosion of comic book properties on TV has been amazing , but it s been lacking in one crucial regard : female heroes . Of the six comic book shows currently on the air , only one has a female lead . Of course , comics themselves have long leaned toward male protagonists . But that s due , in large part , to their primary audience being young men and boys . That s changing , though recent social media numbers suggest that comic book fandom is nearly 47 percent female nowadays . Not only are comic companies responding , but studios are picking up the call CBS has put a Supergirl show into development , Jessica Jones is one of Netflix s four series centered around Hell s Kitchen in New York City , and The CW s iZombie premieres March 17 . Here , then , is a list in honor of the departing Agent Carter and the returning Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ( who both dominate the list ) of the best female comic heroes on TV currently with hopes that the roster will grow quickly in the very near future . Gotham is absent from this list , although , since Jim Gordon himself would n t necessarily be considered a superhero , maybe it gets a pass . The Flash , however , has some work to do . It had Plastique ( now dead ) and , in the future , may have Caitlin Snow ( who will eventually become Killer Frost ) , though whether she becomes a hero or villain is still unknown . It s a great show , but a stronger womanly presence would be appreciated . 6 . Zed Martin , Constantine The character of Liv Aberdine was replaced after the pilot because the producers felt like she spent too much time reacting to things and simply waiting to be rescued . At first , it seemed like Zed was the answer certainly , her fiery attitude suggested she was capable of much more . But as the series wore on , she fell further and further into sit back and wait for Constantine to save the day mode . Perhaps , given more time , the show can delve further into the Resurrection Crusade storyline , which might give Zed a little more agency . In the comics , Zed dies , but with some slight changes , that arc could be the crucible that makes the character worth watching . The writers may not get that chance , though while Constantine has n t yet been canceled officially , the ratings did n t necessarily merit a pickup . 5 . Black Canary , Arrow So far , Black Canary has spent way more time receiving beatings than dishing them out . But give her time . It s taken two-and-a-half seasons to evolve Laurel Lance to the point where she takes up the mantle of Black Canary something comic fans have known would happen since the show s inception . Related : 9 TV Star Blogs to Follow Another way to look at it is , she s 61 episodes into her origin story . That time has allowed the character to become as nuanced as any on the show . Oliver had five years to go from billionaire playboy to urban vigilante it looks like Starling City is Laurel s Lian Yu . 4 . Melinda May , Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent May , The Cavalry as she s sometimes known , is the right hand of Director Coulson and between actors Ming-Na Wen and Clark Gregg the two carried S.H.I.E.L.D. through its early growing pains with sheer force of personality . May s cold and unyielding strength and Coulson s warm and â€¦ well , also unyielding strength , they re like Mike and Carol Brady for the comic book generation . In person , Wen is as bubbly and cheerful as her character is dour , and if the show could do anything to improve her character , it would be to give her more opportunities to demonstrate other facets of her demeanor . Or , at the very least , bring back Agent 33 for more May on May action . 3 . Felicity Smoak , Arrow Felicity plays essentially the same role as Caitlin Snow does on The Flash , but she s so much more integral to Arrow that it s hard to argue that she does n t deserve the spot . She s the eyes and ears and brain and , often , the heart of Team Arrow ( a job that gets split between two people on Flash ) . Give her a mask , and you might as well call the show Smoak . Related : The 99 Greatest TV Characters Since Tony Soprano : # 99-90 Much of the credit goes to Emily Bett Rickards , whose role was originally intended as a one-off , but her chemistry with Stephen Amell was so great , she was a series regular by Season 2 . She s the x factor that makes a good show great , and she ends midway up this list only on a technicality . 2 . Skye , aka Daisy Johnson , Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. If nothing else , Skye earns the slot by being the only woman on TV with honest-to-goodness superpowers . Though we ve seen merely a taste , her code name in the comics is Quake , as the trembling and shattered lights of the last episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. can attest to . She could also have earned the slot by being the most improved character on the list . In the first season of S.H.I.E.L.D. , it was widely believed that she was there simply to be pretty and ask questions to reveal basic plot points for the viewer . But the betrayal of Agent Ward galvanized Skye , and when she returned in Season 2 , she made wading through the earlier iteration of her character eminently worthwhile . 1 . Peggy Carter , Agent Carter If Black Widow were 60 years older , she d be Agent Peggy Carter . Tough , beautiful , and to borrow a phrase able to do anything the men do only backwards and in heels . Related : What â€˜ Agent Carter Can Learn From TV s Other Comic Book Shows The thing that sets her apart from everyone else on this list is that her character and the show work both on the level of action and social commentary . Like the X-Men booksat their best , in which the plight of mutants stands as a metaphor for the civil rights struggle , or Spider-Man , which explores the passage from childhood to adulthood , Carter is as much about post-World War II America and the social upheaval that accompanied women s entry into , then expulsion from , the workplace as it is about Nitramene imploding oil refineries . And , lest we forget , she can also handle a machine gun like a boss . What more could you ask for ? Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC . ",

		"paragraph": "The NFL is mired in a ratings slump , down a second straight year over 2015 s high-water mark . But there s another side to the story : the NFL remains TV s unchallenged champion , accounting for 13 of the top 20 and 37 of the top 50 most-watched programs in 2017 . Nielsen s live-plus-same-day data pegged Super Bowl LI , Patriots-Falcons , as the top individual program of the year , with 111.3 million viewers . A far-distant second was the Dallas-Green Bay divisional playoff , with the Pittsburgh-New England championship ranking third . The only non-NFL program to rank in the top seven was President Trump s address to Congress , which placed fourth . ( See the full list here . ) Beyond football , what Nielsen s Top 50 list demonstrates is the power of live broadcasts . Not a single pre-recorded program cracked the entire top 50 , with awards shows , presidential addresses , the World Series , the NBA Finals , and the college football and basketball playoffs making up the remainder of the non-NFL top 50 list . The NFL s television presence is truly a half-full/half-empty scenario . It s indisputable that ratings are down for the NFL from 2015 highs ratings are down from 2016 levels by an average of eight percent . Opponents of the NFL s protests this season proclaim that disgust with the league s social stances is the prime , or even only , reason for the decline , but the numbers do n t necessarily bear that out . Ratings for all primetime programs are down 9 percent , suggesting that while politics surely plays some role in viewers decisions to turn away from the NFL , kneeling is n t as responsible for the ratings decline as changing viewing habits . Plus , the NFL owns both those individual programs noted above as well as Sunday Night Football , which finished 2017 as the top-rated program for a record seventh straight year . And , as AdAge notes , despite some griping from sponsors , revenue for in-game ad sales is up two percent over last year . The NFL stands as the dominant television force in America by a vast margin , and in an increasingly fragmented world , that s not an automatically sustainable position . The league faces substantial threats to its continued reign , both from within and without , but for the moment , the NFL continues to take the largest slice of a smaller overall pie .

		"paragraph": "( Bloomberg ) -- Tesla Inc. is in the process of procuring land in Shanghai for its first factory outside of the U.S. , according to people with direct knowledge of the matter , pushing ahead with plans to set up production in China after months of tumult involving CEO Elon Musk . The carmaker is the sole bidder for a plot of land with an auction price of about 1 billion yuan ( $ 145 million ) , the people said , asking not to be identified as the information is n t public . A decision by the Shanghai government to allocate the land to Tesla could be made as soon as this month , they said . In July , Tesla reached a preliminary agreement with Shanghai authorities to build a factory that the electric-car pioneer has said will eventually produce 500,000 battery-powered vehicles annually , more than what its lone U.S. assembly plant has made . Setting up manufacturing in China will enable the Palo Alto , California-based company to avoid paying import duties as high as 40 percent and offer cheaper cars in the world s biggest market for electric vehicles . The Shanghai government did n t respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours . Representatives for Tesla also did n t immediately comment . The company has said the China factory will augment existing production and that its U.S. manufacturing operations wo n t be affected . The progress on its China plans is a bright spot of news for Tesla , which has been pummeled in the stock market the past few months after Musk s funding-secured tweeting scandal and the resulting fallout with U.S. regulators . The carmaker is considering raising some of the $ 5 billion it intends to invest in the plant near Shanghai from local partners , Bloomberg News reported on Aug. 1 , citing a person familiar with the plans . Musk told analysts on an earnings call later that day that he expected it would take about $ 2 billion worth of investment for the factory to be able to produce around 250,000 vehicles a year . -- With assistance from Dandan Li .

		"paragraph": "Kylie Jenner 's net worth , as of July 16 , was a jaw-dropping $ 900 million according to Forbes . This figure put the 20-year-old at number three on Forbes ' Celebrity 100 list and number 27 on the ( more questionable ) Self-Made Women list . In her interview with Forbes , Jenner attributed much of her success to social media . Indeed , there 's another , lesser known , though increasingly important , list where Jenner reigns supreme : The Instagram Rich List . This annual ranking , released this week , is compiled by Hopper , a UK-based company that produces a scheduling and analytics tool for Instagram users . The company estimates that Jenner , who boasts 111 million followers , can bring in $ 1,000,000 per sponsored post . Yes , that 's for a single sponsored post . It 's more than you , me , and probably all of our best friends combined make in a single year . ( It is n't called the rich list for nothing . ) Selena Gomez , number two on the list , can bring in an estimated $ 800,000 per post according to Hopper 's research . The rest of the top 10 is rounded out by a trio of buff soccer stars ( Lionel Messi , Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. , Cristiano Ronaldo ) , Queen Bey , Dwayne Johnson , the newly betrothed Bieber , and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner clan ( Kim and Kendall ) . Khlo , who is just outside of the top 10 in the eleventh spot , makes an estimated $ 480,000 per post . If these figures surprise you , they should n't . They are just further proof of what the increasing number of brands who are putting substantial budgets behind SponCon and dark ads ( when a brand simply uses an influencer 's name to promote a product , without requiring a post ) already know : There is big money to be made on a ( sponsored ) ' gram . In March , social media influencer agency MediaKix predicted that influencer marketing will be a $ 5 to $ 10 billion industry within the next five years , as brands devote larger portions of their marketing budgets to the individuals who command audiences they want to reach . This is the way sponsorships have always worked , and Instagram is just their newest , most quickly growing medium . It is n't hard to believe that Instagram , or rather someone 's presence on Instagram , could someday become one of the largest determinants of where a celebrity ranks on annual money lists . The bigger someone 's Instagram following and engagement ( measured through factors such as number of likes and comments ) , the higher their status in the Insta SponCon world . The higher their status , the more brands want to work with them . The more brands want to work with them , the pickier they can get when choosing deals and negotiating rates . And when you get to this point , that 's when you can charge six figure rates la a Kardashian . This begs a larger question , though : Will influencer marketing on Instagram reach a point where the bubble bursts , SponCon becomes less effective , and individual profits drop ? As a platform , Instagram currently shows no sign of slowing down . Facebook 's crown jewel celebrated one billion monthly active users in June , up from 800 million in September 2017 . If not Instagram itself , then what about the brands advertising there ? Mediakix predicts that in 2018 , brands will spend $ 1.6 billion on influencer marketing on Instagram . But this spend may not always have the desired result . When speaking about the changing meaning of public figures on Instagram earlier this week , Kate Wolff , the SVP of Client Services at relationship marketing agency RQ , said she 's started seeing a backlash against the way influencer marketing currently operates : \" People now know that a lot of content that comes from influencers is BS , for lack of a better term . They re doing it to get a paycheck and brands will pay whatever amount of money to be associated with someone s audience and have them extend their reach into a new space . \" If celebrity influencers are n't careful they could start to build mistrust among their fanbases . This would prove problematic , since \" their value is based on is their loyal fanbase , \" Wolff said . \" When you dilute that , the less impactful the programming and entire subset of influencer marketing will be . \" Let 's not forget Kim Kardashian West 's \" appetite suppressant lollipop \" snafu this past May . ( Note , however , that Kardashian West is still ranked fourth on Hopper 's Rich List . ) For now , Kylie Jenner 's Instagram rates may continue to climb and her ranking on Forbes ' money lists go up as a result . But if the current climate of mistrust continues , all it may take is a few misguided posts for the SponCon success to come tumbling down . Like what you see ?

		"paragraph": "By Hugh Bronstein BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - U.S. farmers could receive cash payments from a planned $ 12 billion aid package as soon as late September , U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told Reuters on Saturday , warning that the program will not make tariff-hit farmers whole . Perdue said in an interview on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of agriculture ministers in Buenos Aires that the plan would include between $ 7 billion and $ 8 billion in direct cash relief . U.S. growers are expected to take an $ 11 billion hit due to retaliatory tariffs after Washington placed duties on Chinese goods . \" Obviously this is not going to make farmers whole , \" Perdue said . The program includes cash for farmers of soybeans , sorghum , corn , wheat , cotton , dairy and hogs . It offers government purchases of fruits , nuts , rice , legumes , beef , pork and milk for distribution to food banks and nutrition programs . And it promises a trade promotion program to develop new markets . Only about $ 200 million will go toward the expansion of trade missions , Perdue said . The aid plan , a response to retaliatory trade measures on U.S. farm exports , is intended only for the current crop cycle , he said . \" It 's for the 2018 crop . We do not expect to do this over a period of time , \" Perdue said . President Donald Trump announced the program on Tuesday to mixed reactions from U.S. Midwest growers and legislators who said they object to the administration 's tariffs . Trump , however , has made it clear that tariffs are his weapon of choice in trade fights . China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans , dairy , meat , produce and liquor after Washington slapped duties on Chinese goods . The aid will make use of a Great Depression-era program . Starting on Sept. 4 farmers can apply for help . They will be asked to provide data on their current crops . \" We expect the checks to go out in late September or October . As soon as they prove their yields , \" Perdue said . \" They will be based on actual production , not historical averages . \" Some changes in U.S. crop planning are probably on the way as Washington grapples with some of its biggest trade partners . \" I think we 'll see more corn planted next year rather than soybeans . But that 's not for me to determine , \" Perdue said . \" We want people to plant according to market signals rather than government programs , \" he added . \" There 's no farmer in the United States that would rather have a government check than a good crop at a fair price . That 's what our safety net is all about . \" Perdue grew up on a farm in Georgia .

		"paragraph": "Drug pricing has become a key priority for President Trump . And it s no surprise why . Some drugs for cancer carry a price tag of over $ 100,000 per year with a big portion of costs falling on patients themselves . And drugs for rare diseases made by companies like Alexion ( ALXN ) and Biomarin ( BMRN ) can cost upwards of $ 500,000 per year . The last year or two included major controversies over drug prices , including the price of Mylan s ( MYL ) Epipen allergy treatment , which rose 500 % from 2009 to 2016 before it introduced a lower-priced generic option . Before that , Martin Shkreli s Turing Pharmaceuticals drew criticism for raising the price of an anti-parasite drug by 5,500 % . And beleaguered Valeant ( VRX ) , which grew from a controversial acquisition strategy , came under fire for price hikes , including jacking up the price of two heart drugs by more than 500 % and 200 % after acquiring the rights to sell them . These companies became the poster children for greed in the pharma space , bringing the sector s drug-pricing practices into public view . Prescription drug prices rose 6.2 % in 2016 , according to the pricing data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . That s about three times the overall rate of inflation . And many consumers without insurance face stratospheric costs if they need life-saving , brand-name drugs where there is no generic available . Healthcare investment bank Leerink Swann analyzed nearly 1,000 branded drugs and found 10 % of all drugs had seen price increases of 3x or higher between 2011 and 2016 , and seven drugs saw increases above 5x , as shown below . So what s behind all of this ? There are a few drivers . First off , there is a complicated system of middlemen with different interests that puts upward pressure on pricing . Meanwhile , drug companies ( which largely determine pricing ) are motivated by profit and justify higher prices by pointing to high costs for research and development , including for failed studies . There is also minimal competition , given patent rules , FDA backlog for generic drugs , and restrictions on imports . Plus , Medicare , the biggest purchaser of drugs , is n t allowed to negotiate prices . In interviews about the EpiPen price increase , Mylan CEO Heather Bresch deflected blame away from her company onto the healthcare system as a whole . I am hoping that this is an inflection point for this country , Bresch told CNBC in an interview last summer about the Epipen outcry . Our health care is in crisis . It s no different than the mortgage financial crisis back in 2007 . Bresch explained while the list price for EpiPens was $ 608 , Mylan took $ 274 of that with the remaining $ 334 going to intermediaries , including pharmacy benefit managers ( PBMs ) , insurers , wholesalers , and pharmacy retailers . In other words , according to Bresch , much of the price increase is coming from the system , not the drugmaker specifically . This is n t an EpiPen issue , this is n t a Mylan issue . This is a health care issue â€¦ the system is broken , she said . Indeed , the system has received scrutiny , including names such as the nation s largest PBM , Express Scripts ( ESRX ) . Insurance companies rely on PBMs to manage costs while drug manufacturers rely on PBMs to put their products in front of customers . PBMs negotiate with pharmacies and drug manufacturers to get discounts on drug prices that they pass to insurance companies . They also negotiate contracts with pharmacies to create a network of retail locations for drug distribution . PBMs revenue comes primarily from rebates paid by drug manufacturers in order to be carried on a PBM s system . This , according to some analysts , creates skewed incentives toward PBMs dispensing more expensive drugs ( because the higher the price , the higher the rebate ) . Meanwhile , the current pricing system reflects a reliance on insurance companies , which means that pricing is not based on consumer demand or ability to pay but instead on how much insurance companies will cover , as noted by Bloomberg View s Matt Levine . Plus , Medicare , the single biggest purchaser of drugs in the US , is n t allowed to negotiate prices of drugs , contributing to higher costs . At traditional biotech and pharma companies , increased drug pricing is at least purported to incorporate the cost of developing the drug and to incentivize companies to innovate and develop new ones . This has been the defense of Gilead ( GILD ) , which has come under scrutiny for the high price of its Hepatitis C drug . ( The cost to develop a new drug and win FDA marketing approval is pegged at about $ 2.6 billion , according to a 2014 report from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development . ) So what should profit margins be ? The gross profit margin for Mylan , for example , stands at about 40 % , normal for the industry . For Mylan or any manufacturer , there is a grey area in what is viewed as appropriate versus aggressive price increases , especially on critical care drugs with near-monopoly positions that have large pediatric or elderly populations , according to RBC s Randall Stanicky . In the end , it seems pharma and biotech CEOs have focused on enhancing shareholder value , which may conflict with consumers best interests . And while Bresch was quick to blame the system , Mylan s ability to respond to the outburst of criticism last year with a lower-priced alternative shows it could have done more earlier , according to analysts . ( At the end of last summer , Mylan responded to the pricing outcry , announcing it would cover up to $ 300 in out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy , which would reduce what patients paid by 50 % off Mylan s list price . Then the company followed up with an announcement that it would launch a generic version of the EpiPen , for a list price of $ 300 for a two-pack carton . ) Given the choice , Mylan would probably have continued raising the price of the EpiPen before the media firestorm , according to analysts . Historically , Mylan has hiked the price on the EpiPen twice a year . Meanwhile , monopolies have built up for different drug categories , analysts say . Specifically , in the last few years , backlog has built up at the Food and Drug Administration for approvals of generic alternatives . Plus , there have been instances where companies that market branded drugs have paid generic drug makers to delay roll-out of generic options , a tactic known as pay-for-delay . Now there are even some investigations into generic drug pricing . Generic drug maker Perrigo ( PRGO ) recently announced its offices were searched by the Department of Justice as part of an investigation into potential price collusion . The importation of cheap drugs from Canada or other countries where prices are far lower is also not allowed . In other countries , the health system is simpler with fewer organizations trying to buy drugs so they have greater purchasing power . By contrast , in the US , insurance groups , hospitals and plans buy drugs for consumers , resulting in a wide variety of pricing . Political and consumer pressure does seem to be setting off changes at certain companies including Mylan , but the high cost of drugs across the industry remains a problem . RBC s Stanicky said the recent outcries will deter companies to some degree from boosting prices . This will shift focus back to drug pricing and we have to think it will be another disincentive to companies to use price ( brand or generic ) as a mechanism to offset the potential gross margin pressure that we still see ahead for the generic/hybrid sector , he wrote in a note . In January , Trump met with pharmaceutical representatives , pushing them to to cut prices , which he said are astronomical . The CEOs of drug companies including Merck ( MRK ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) , Eli Lilly ( LLY ) and Amgen ( AMGN ) are certainly in the crosshairs . Trump , while saying we have to get drug prices down . We have no choice also struck a friendly tone , saying he will cut regulations on drugmakers and build a more favorable business climate . He ll likely be met with resistance , though , because big pharma has powerful lobbyists in Washington . Absent a specific plan from the Trump administration so far , many lawmakers have called for more scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies along with all the middlemen like pharmacy benefit managers . Penalties for unjustified price increases ( including fines and rebates ) could also be rolled out . But this could prove difficult under an administration that has also promised to reduce regulations . There has also been a push-back on consolidation . Aetna ( AET ) had proposed a merger with Humana ( HUM ) but that was shut down . And Anthem s ( ANTM ) pursuit of a merger with Cigna ( CI ) looks all but dead . Analysts have proposed making more generics and international branded drugs available to boost competition , but that may be difficult to institute , particularly for drugs under patent protection .

		"paragraph": "Charles Manson the vile human who organized a grungy cult that murdered the actress Sharon Tate and four others at her home in 1969 has died at age 83 . Manson was a petty thief and pimp who carved a swastika in his forehead and babbled angrily about a coming race war . Yet he achieved a perverse kind of glory as a pop presence , exerting a pull on numerous musicians , writers , producers , and actors . Scores of TV movies and books have been written about him his sputtered music career fascinated some famous musicians . The key to Manson s infamy is that he committed his most notable crimes in Los Angeles and its environs . In dispatching his so-called family of broken-down , brainwashed disciples to a showbiz-posh neighborhood in Benedict Canyon , Manson knew that the house he d pointed his minions toward had once been occupied by Terry Melcher , a famous Hollywood record producer . Manson blamed Melcher , among others , for the failure of his recording career . Manson had befriended Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and played Wilson his songs , hoping the Beach Boy would help him land a music contract . Nothing happened , although Wilson did record a song of Manson s , Cease to Exist , whose title Wilson changed to Never Learn Not to Love . That Manson had rubbed his dirty shoulders with the Hollywood famous brought him instant attention upon his arrest . When he turned out to be a vicious , long-haired psychopath who d emerged from the dank alleys of San Francisco s Haight-Ashbury hippie scene , Manson s place in pop culture might have been predicted . When it was discovered that he referred to a coming apocalypse as Helter Skelter , a phrase borrowed from the Beatles , his notoriety was cemented . Musicians such as Marilyn Manson ( where do you think Brian Hugh Walter got half of his stage name ? ) and Guns N Roses , looking to tap into a vein of easy evil , recorded Charles Manson songs . Film buffs took notice that the site of the Manson Family compound was Spahn Ranch , which in earlier decades had been the frequent location for movie and TV shoots , especially Westerns : Duel in the Sun as well as episodes of The Lone Ranger and Bonanza were filmed there . The most famous book about Manson is Helter Skelter , by lawyer Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry . But the better book is The Family , written in 1971 by the poet and journalist Ed Sanders . Subtitled The Story of Charles Manson s Dune Buggy Attack Battalion , Sanders s book captures the countercultural atmosphere whose idealism could also turn rancid and end up a petri dish for Manson s nihilism . And the best book of all may be Jeff Guinn s 2013 Manson : The Life and Times of Charles Manson , scrupulously researched and reported . On television , Manson became a prime get a much sought-after interviewee for TV personalities ranging from Diane Sawyer to Tom Snyder , whose 1981 session with Manson is creepy stuff indeed . Manson inspired one entire TV series : Aquarius , a two-season show starring David Duchovny as a cop chasing down Manson ( played by Gethin Anthony ) along the dusty trail to Spahn Ranch . Numerous TV dramas used Manson , or fictionalized versions of Manson , as subplot-metaphors for wayward youths who fall under the spell of evil seducers . Lost s Jeremy Davies played Manson in Helter Skelter , a 2004 CBS adaptation of Bugliosi s book . Manson was also used for comedy : On The Ben Stiller Show in the early 1990s , Bob Odenkirk played the criminal in a recurring segment called Ask Manson . In recent years , attention has turned to some of the women Manson attracted to his cult . The Lifetime movie Manson s Lost Girls , from 2016 , is typical of this subdivision of Manson studies . Manson lore has also received a boost via the current true-crime boom , with podcasts such as You Must Remember This pouring hours of Manson poison into your earbuds . Does Manson deserve to occupy a place in our minds ? Of course not . But his awful crimes , the lives he destroyed , and the sense we try to make of it all continue to reach out to us and wo n t allow us to forget him . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Bad news , Russell Westbrook : rather than going one up on them , you re going to have to settle for just hanging out alongside Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan for basketball eternity . What a bummer . [ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry ] Westbrook saw his historic streak of triple-doubles snapped at seven on Sunday night , as he fell short of double-figure assists for just the ninth time in 24 games this season . That means he ll join the 1960-61 edition of The Big O and the 1988-89 version of MJ in second place on the all-time triple-double streak list , two games behind Wilt Chamberlain s record of nine , set during the 1967-68 campaign . There is , however , good news for Russ and his Oklahoma City Thunder . His streak-snapping six assists came attached to an efficient and blistering 37 points in 36 minutes , 12 rebounds and two steals , as he dominated in the second half and came up with the deciding plays late to cap a rally from 13 points down and lead the Thunder to a 99-96 win over the Boston Celtics at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday night . Coming off a tough three-point loss to the Houston Rockets on Friday , Oklahoma City sputtered out of the gate and headed into halftime down four , thanks largely to a brutal shooting performance that saw the Thunder miss all 13 3-point shots they took before intermission en route to just 39 first-half points , a season low . The Celtics came out of the break hot , with center Al Horford settling the table and knocking down shots to push the Boston lead to 13 with 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the third â€¦ and then , Westbrook happened . He scored seven straight points late in the third , helping cut OKC s deficit to four entering the final 12 minutes with some help from unheralded reserve guard Semaj Christon , who saw more time on the ball after Victor Oladipo left the game due to a scary fall while contesting a Jonas Jerebko shot . ( He d thankfully come away from the ordeal with nothing more serious than a sprained wrist . ) After getting a breather to start the fourth , Westbrook attacked time and again , knocking the Celtics back on their heels , creating looks for himself or teammates like big men Steven Adams and Joffrey Lauvergne , while also getting himself to the free-throw line . When OKC needed plays down the stretch , Westbrook answered the bell . Trailing by three with 2:49 remaining , he pulled up and splashed through a triple over the outstretched arm of Celtics defender Terry Rozier to knot the game at 92 . Down 94-92 just over a minute later , the 6-foot-3 Westbrook out-jumped the 6-foot-10 Horford to tip away the rebound of an Avery Bradley miss , beat four other players to the loose ball along the sideline , tipped it into the frontcourt to teammate Anthony Morrow , then streaked ahead for a return pass before slicing through the heart of the Celtics defense for a game-tying layup . After the two teams traded miscues a clanged jumper by Russ on one end , an ill-timed pass by Horford that went out of bounds for a turnover Westbrook called for a screen from Adams before rejecting it , racing past All-Defensive First Teamer Bradley to his right and making a beeline for the basket before sliding between contesting big men Horford and Amir Johnson for a lefty layup that put OKC up 96-94 with 30.6 ticks left . Then , after fighting with Bradley over a missed shot to result in a tie-up , Westbrook not only won the ensuing jump ball , but sent the ball into the frontcourt where Christon could corral it , forcing Boston s defense to scramble and leaving the door open for a wide-open dunk by Jerami Grant with 14.4 seconds left . A missed attempt of a game-tying 3 at the buzzer by Marcus Smart sealed the win , improving Oklahoma City s record to 15-9 , sixth-best in the Western Conference . Westbrook lost his triple-double streak , but he might have found something he prizes even more : his touch . After failing to make half of his field-goal attempts in his previous 10 games , shooting just 38.5 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from 3-point range in that span , Westbrook finished 14-for-26 from the floor and 2-for-5 from long distance , locating his rhythm and flow just in time to sink the visiting C s . Just taking shots I wanted to take , that was the most important part , he said after the game , according to Cliff Brunt of The Associated Press . And playing from the block . That s the most important part . I talked to my dad this morning , and he got on me about not using that to my advantage , and I definitely tried to do more of that tonight . With All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas missing his third straight game with a groin strain , Boston just did n t have the firepower to go bucket-for-bucket down the stretch . Brad Stevens club managed just 13 points over the final eight minutes Westbrook matched the C s by himself in that span on 6-for-18 shooting . They also committed three turnovers that led to five critical Thunder points , helping squander their advantage and leading to their third loss in four games . We had some bad possessions there , said Horford , who led five Celtics in double figures with 19 points , six assists and four rebounds , but did the bulk of that damage early and went scoreless in the final frame . I fumbled a pass there . I felt like [ that ] really hurt us . It is frustrating but we need to look at this film and have a good practice [ Tuesday ] and get focused because no one s going to feel bad for us . We need to pull out of this . [ Follow Ball Do n t Lie on social media : Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ] The Thunder , though , keep rolling , with seven wins in their last eight games and now , they ve even got one that did n t come courtesy of a Westbrook triple-double . Well , maybe not entirely useless , Steve . Through 24 games , Russ is still averaging a triple-double 31.1 points , 10.9 rebounds , 11.0 assists in 35.7 minutes per game and remains on pace to tie Oscar s record for triple-doubles in a season . Not that the man himself cares , of course . Streak or no streak , the winning streak is more important to me , Westbrook said after the game , according to Erik Horne of The Oklahoman .

And Dez had n t caught many of those throws over the last two years , possibly because it s not a throw quarterback Dak Prescott is comfortable making . Lal hopes to help Prescott become comfortable by using precision route-runners who will always be in the spot where they re supposed to be . [ Then Dak ] can throw blind , Lal said . He does n t have to double hitch . He can cut the ball loose . We are always preaching cut it loose on time . How can you do that if you do n t have confidence in your receivers ? It s our job to make it that way . Of course , it s not Lal s job to make Dez upset with express or implied shots at his flaws . That will only inflame the situation , making Dez more likely to continue to find ways to complain about the way he was treated in Dallas , starting with the decision to not cut him until the middle of April . The longer it takes for Dez to find a new NFL job , the greater the chance that this situation will get uglier and uglier . The more that Cowboys employees say things about Dez that are n t flattering , the more he ll be inclined to respond in kind .",

		"paragraph": "Scroll through the Instagram account of anyone interested in fitness and you re bound to find different images of women with six-pack abs or thick glutes . Many have thousands of followers on the social media platform and usually post blog-type updates about their extreme routine or eating habits . But one influencer is now calling them out for it . Jen Bretty of Ontario , Canada , who has over 200,000 followers on Instagram , got fed up with seeing women share potentially disordered fitness habits that they pass off as dedication , so she addressed the issue on Twitter . I m sorry but I feel like there s so many â€˜ IG fitness people who use being dedicated to hide their disordered behaviours , she wrote on Wednesday . I m sick of fitness people normalizing behaviours that people in ( sic ) who suffer from eating disorders are fighting so hard to break . She went on to explain that working out every day and meticulously counting calories should not be perceived as dedication if it s linked to disordered and unhealthy habits associated with orthorexia ( over exercising ) and anorexia . So many people use fitness as a way to control their disordered behaviours in a more acceptable way and we ca n t let that be normalized , she wrote . Fitness should n t mean having to workout everyday or weighing your damn lettuce . Cmon . Bretty tells Yahoo Lifestyle she enjoys fitness and that she used to follow many of these types of social media influencers before she started her account in 2014 to document her recovery from an eating disorder but stopped when their intense fitness messages affected her mental and physical health . Those messages included working out to eat certain foods or preaching no days off . [ Or other ] very extreme behaviors that otherwise would be classified as problematic , but because they are into fitness , we brush it off like it s â€˜ just dedication . she says . These extremes eventually led me to having a very disordered look at food and my body . she tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Working out should not negatively impact your life , and these types of things is what personally impacted my own fitness journey because it made me second-guess every time I ate something that was n t â€˜ healthy or took a rest day . As an eating disorder survivor , Bretty says she does n t want to see disordered behaviors become normalized . So three years after her own recovery journey began , and after still seeing these types of posts , she decided to speak out . As she wrote on Twitter : Just because someone looks fit or dedicated does n t mean they are healthy . Your mental health matters too . So be careful who you look up to . The internet is obviously scary terrain for women and how they view their bodies social media has been linked to eating disorders but Instagram is especially risky . A survey found that of all the social media platforms , Instagram is the worst for mental health . Not good news considering that over 75 percent of teens ages 13-17 , an especially vulnerable age for developing eating disorders , chose IG or Insta as their platform of choice . Other Instagram influencers have brought attention to the real and posed images in our feeds , but Bretty is one of the few who has called out the way certain behaviors and language , specifically , can trigger disorders . She certainly is n t the only one who feels this way . Her tweet got over a 800 likes , and she s continuously praised on Instagram for her self-love and recovery-focused posts . Her latest message : It s OK to unfollow people who are harmful to your mental health . Bretty would know , because she s been there . I know how it feels to be on the other end of the screen beating yourself up over not looking like these Instagram models do , she says . I want to show people that you do n t need to count your calories or sacrifice enjoying your life to be fit or healthy . A healthy lifestyle means more than abs , and I hope that by talking about this stuff that it can help people realize that . We d heart that if we could .

		"paragraph": "Ferrari fans longing for a return of the elegance of the marque 's early cars are in for a real treat as the automaker this week introduced a pair of stunners based on the 812 Superfast . They 're called the Monza SP1 and SP2 , with the SP in the name referencing Ferrari 's Special Projects in-house coachbuilder and the numerical component corresponding to the number of seats . Both are strict speedsters , and while their design may be retro the technology within is the most advanced in the Ferrari portfolio . The Monza SP1 and SP2 were presented to the public at Ferrari 's headquarters in Maranello , Italy on Tuesday , with loyal customers being treated to an early showing on Monday . That likely means all build slots , which we 're told will be less than 500 , have all been sold . Inspiration for the cars came from iconic Ferrari racing barchettas of the past , not least the 1948 166 MM , and the 750 and 860 Monza . We would n't be surprised if Jannarelly 's Design 1 , itself inspired by 1950s-era Ferraris , also played a role in shaping the design . The SP1 was designed as an uncompromising single-seater that offers a truly unique experience behind the wheel . The SP2 , thanks to the elimination of the tonneau cover and the addition of a second protective screen and a second roll-bar , is a two-seater , thus allowing a passenger to enjoy the same thrills as the driver . But without a windscreen , Ferrari needed a solution to enable owners to enjoy the cars without having to always resort to a helmet . That solution was Ferrari 's new Virtual Wind Shield which has been incorporated into the fairing ahead of the instrument panel and the steering wheel . This deviates a part of the air flow to maintain driving comfort . Sadly , though , the passenger in the SP2 misses out . The underlying platform is mostly aluminum but Ferrari has crafted the entire body out of carbon fiber . The cabin is trimmed in the same material with a natural finish to enhance the sporty impact of the design . Weight reduction plus a very low center of gravity result in a perfectly balanced driving experience with almost no roll , Ferrari says . Under the long carbon fiber hood sits the same 6.5-liter V-12 of the 812 Superfast . Here , output has been dialed to 798 horsepower , up 9 hp on the donor car . Peak torque remains capped at 530 pound-feet . Driving the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission , the engine will hurtle the cars to 62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 124 mph in 7.9 seconds . While the Monzas are likely sold out , Ferrari says the cars are just the first in a new and very exclusive series called Icona . These will draw inspiration from the most evocative Ferraris of the 1950s and are more than likely destined to be future classics . Ferrari makes no qualms about the cars being aimed at collectors .",

		"paragraph": "Let s imagine a world where ABC s Roseanne spinoff The Conners is not an eleventh-hour financial decision by ABC to salvage a catastrophe and plug a giant hole in their fall schedule . Let s imagine a situation where The Conners is a passion project , a just-so-strange-it-might-work idea for a sitcom that speaks to life in 2018 , that s about life inside a working-class family that straddles a political divide . What would that show look like ? What could The Conners be ? The official ABC release about the spinoff has a few details : After a sudden turn of events , it says , the Conners are forced to face the daily struggles of life in Lanford in a way they never have before . It also promises an unexpected pregnancy , financial pressures , and coupon cutting , all in a way that will demonstrate that families can always find common ground through conversation . Is there a way to translate all of that PR pabulum into a great sitcom ? Yes , I think so . But first , Roseanne Conner would have to die . The press release seems to hint at something like this a sudden turn of events suggests a tragedy and frankly , it s the only honest way to make a clean break . If The Conners is going to be Roseanne without Roseanne but the character does n t die , the show will quickly tilt toward the same self-loathing , ironicized mess of the original Roseanne s ninth season . It would n t be a show about a working-class family it d be a show about the strangeness of its own existence . Plus , anything less than Roseanne s death leaves the door open for her return , which would be a remarkably craven gesture . So , Roseanne has to die . And then , like the Roseanne revival always should ve been , The Conners becomes a show about Darlene . A number of recent sitcoms have been about adult children living with their parents ( Mom , The Ranch , Sh*t My Dad Says ) , but a show about Darlene and Becky has the unusual opportunity to treat that story as a continuation rather than a starting point . After all , it s an immensely sad story for Darlene : She spent nine seasons on Roseanne dreaming of leaving Lanford , but now she s back in her father s home . It s maybe even more sad for Becky , who has never even conceived of a way out . The Conners could finally treat those stories as a narrative anchor , rather than marginalizing them as a satellite story line to Roseanne and Dan s marriage . It could be about the tension between two sisters who never really got each other , but who are now stuck with many of the same predicaments , and who are stuck with each other . In the aftermath of Roseanne Conner s death , The Conners could also become a show about grief . I know , I know : That sounds exactly like the kind of lighthearted family fare everyone is looking for . But avoiding real emotion , dodging serious discussions , and trying to put a Band-Aid over gaping wounds were precisely the problems of the Roseanne revival . The Conners would still be a sitcom , but the humor would be pegged to Darlene s sensibility rather than to Roseanne s . Less mother knows best , let me swipe you upside the head and lecture you about kids having it too easy these days . More life is bleak and existence is short , but everything is absurd and we may as well laugh . There s another reason to imagine The Conners could be successful . In addition to the consequences of her cruel , racist , and harmfully conspiratorial Twitter feed , Barr also offered much less natural acting in the revival than she had in the original series . While Goodman , Gilbert , Metcalf , and the rest of the cast hit their beats and made the show s rhythm their own , Barr often seemed to be reading from cue cards . What once came off as a refreshingly , bracingly direct style on the original series did not translate well into the revival , where Barr seemed less concerned about being within the story and more obviously concerned about performing the story . I m curious what The Conners could look like without that stilted performance element . Still , the problem with The Conners is that even without Roseanne Conner ( or Roseanne Barr ) , the revival gave little indication that it was capable of being a thoughtful , insightful show . The season finale in particular had little to do with Roseanne s character : The Conners were faced with a flood and a health crisis that doubled as a financial morass , and none of the events of the episode turned on Roseanne making a big decision or coming to a realization or driving the story in any way . Her knee injury was important to the story , but Roseanne herself was not . Even in spite of that decentralized role , the revival failed to follow through on its intentionally provocative statements about divisions within America , and it failed to push past platitudes and petty snipes . It sought the glory of being an open-eyed look at American life , but whenever push came to shove , it flinched . It s hard to believe that The Conners will be much different , especially because several writers and executive producers behind the revival series ( including Tom Werner , Bruce Helford , Dave Caplan , Sara Gilbert , Tony Hernandez , and Bruce Rasmussen , who s credited as writing the season-ten finale ) , are the creative team for The Conners . But yes , I can imagine a successful version of The Conners . It would be a show about trying to foster your kids hopes and dreams even after your own did not work out as you d imagined . It would be about the disorientation of grief and the absurdity and awkwardness of Aunt Jackie trying to fill Roseanne s shoes . It would be about what it feels like for D.J. s daughter , Mary , to be the only person of color in her family . It would be about Dan making a mess of his grandson s preferred pronouns , Darlene chastising him , and Dan trying again . And it would surely have a very dark , very funny episode about Dan trying to fill out all the necessary paperwork after Roseanne s death . But the Roseanne revival did not present much reason to hope that we ll see that version of The Conners this fall . It seems much more likely that The Conners will be exactly what it seems : a depressing , desperate ghost of a show that exists to plug a hole , and then slowly dissolves until it ca n t even do its hole-plugging job anymore . I would be happy to be proven wrong . Related Articles ",

		"paragraph": "With more networks and streaming services getting into original programming everyday , the demand for televised content is greater than ever . In Adapt This ! we spotlight a piece of previously unadapted material we d love to see become a TV series and even suggest a potential network and creative team . Spider-Girl Source Material : Created as a literal What If , Peter Parker s spider-powered teenage daughter proved popular enough with readers to headline several solo comic books ( including Spider-Girl and The Amazing Spider-Girl ) and still pops up as a back-up feature in her dad s various titles . ( By the way , the character should n t be confused with Spider-Woman , a separate heroine with no relation to the Parker clan . ) Related : The 12 Most Exciting Pilots for Fall 2015 Thumbnail Synopsis : Back in 1998 , Marvel Comics mainstay Tom DeFalco dreamed up the MC2 line of comics , which imagined an alternate future in which the job of superhero-ing fell to a group of newer , younger characters like a fresh-faced group of Avengers and Spider-Girl aka May Mayday Parker , the child of now-retired Spider-Man , Peter Parker , and his long-suffering model girlfriend-turned-wife , Mary Jane Watson . A 15-year-old firecracker , May did n t really need spider-powers to become the confident , outgoing teen her father most definitely was n t during his high school years . But boy , did she take advantage of her abilities once they emerged , taking her dad s with great power comes great responsibility mantra to heart and tangling with new villains like Raptor and Killerwatt , as well as such vintage Papa Spidey rogues as Hobgoblin and Carnage . Why It Would Make Great TV : After a shaky start with the underwhelming launch of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , Marvel s TV arm has buffed up its creative muscles by drilling down and putting their shows ahead of their superheroes . To wit , the creatively revitalized S.H.I.E.L.D. is now a densely-serialized espionage story instead of a case-of-the-week procedural with a revolving cast of super-baddies . Meanwhile , Marvel s second network series Agent Carter functioned as a crackling post-World War II period piece , pleasantly punctuated by feats of kick-ass derring-do . And now there s Netflix s just-launched Daredevil , a 13-episode crime story that s more interested in crusading lawyer Matt Murdock than his alter ego s extracurricular vigilante activities . Related : â€˜ Daredevil Cast Talks Diet , Stunts , ' Marvel Lockdown Spider-Girl , then , offers Marvel the chance to break into yet another new genre : high school dramedy . Done right , a Spider-Girl series could be the My So-Called Life or Freaks and Geeks of comic book television , a coming-of-age story that captures the emotional roller coaster ride of that pivotal four-year timespan through the eyes of a teen girl juggling her family s legacy and her own evolving identity . In that way , the series could correct some of the mistakes made by its direct predecessor in this space , the DC Comics-inspired Smallville , a series that started with good intentions , but suffered from an initially endearing , and ultimately off-putting campiness , not to mention scripts of dubious quality . Smallville was also allowed to run well-past its sell-by date , finally wheezing to a close when not-a-Superboy-not-yet-a-Superman was well out of high school . That s another argument in favor of Spider-Girl only spanning Orientation Day to Graduation Day . Besides Angela Chase and Lindsay Weir , Buffy Summers would be another obvious role model for Mayday Parker , as that series was never better than during the characters high school years , when Joss Whedon and his ace writing staff brilliantly grafted horror tropes onto standard , everyday teen dramas like picking a date to prom or breaking up with a bad boyfriend . Buffy also was ( and still is ) incredibly funny , and a good sense of humor is a crucial part of both Spider-Man and Spider-Girl s DNA . In fact , one could argue that neither big-screen incarnation of the Web Head we ve seen thus far Tobey Maguire s Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield s Amazing Spider-Man has really captured that aspect of Spidey s identity . Interestingly , Marvel has confirmed that they ll be taking Spider-Man back to high school in his next appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . A Spider-Girl series would be an ideal complement to Spider-Man s cinematic future , as a four-season series could more fully explore the highs and lows of being a teenage superhero more fully than a two-hour summer blockbuster . Related : The Best Female Comic Book Heroes on TV , Ranked Creative Dream Team : If Buffy is our platonic ideal for Mayday , we d want to entrust the character to one of that show s top writers , specifically Jane Espenson . ( Whedon himself would be great , of course , but he s a big-time movie director now and , besides , he s taking a break from all things Marvel-related after delivering The Avengers : Age of Ultron on May 1 . ) Besides being a battle-tested veteran of genre television ( her post-Buffy gigs include Battlestar Galactica , Torchwood , and Once Upon a Time ) , Espenson possesses a devilishly clever wit and a terrific ear for dialogue As for who would be the right actress to deliver her words , Maisie Williams would be a blast , but Arya Stark is pretty much a superhero anyway . Instead we re considering Modern Family s Ariel Winter , a funny , talented performer ready to graduate beyond the dorky middle child she plays on that fading ABC sitcom . Plus , she comes equipped with comic book bona fides having voiced the Carrie Kelly version of Robin in DC s animated Dark Knight Returns direct-to-DVD adaptation . The final piece of the casting puzzle would be finding the right middle-aged Peter and Mary Jane Parker , to which we have only five words : Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton . Yes , again . Because what better parents could a fledgling Spider-Girl ask for than Coach and Mrs. Coach ? Related : ' Supergirl Costume Revealed : First Pics of Melissa Benoist in Full Super-Suit Ideal Network : Between Arrow and The Flash , the teen-skewing CW is DC-only territory right now , so Marvel would n t be welcome in those parts . ( Same goes for Fox and CBS , home to Gotham and a new Supergirl series one in which the title character is in her early 20s rather than her teenage years respectively . ) An ABC Family berth would make the most sense , as that s within the massive Disney umbrella that also houses Marvel and already has the built-in young adult ( and young-at-heart adult ) demo that the series would target out of the gate .

		"paragraph": "Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers is confident that head coach Steve Kerr will get back on the sidelines and that the pain he is experiencing as the result of a 2015 back surgery is fixable . But he says finding that cure may take time . Here s the bigger picture : He s dealing with something that we have n t been able to decipher , Myers said Wednesday in a 24-minute interview with 95.7 The Game . So where we are now is exploring again what is causing it . The good news is that this is surmountable . This is something he will overcome â€¦ There s a cure . There s a way to fix this . Myers went on to say that Kerr is seeing the best people . NBC Sports Bay Area Insider Monte Poole reports that Kerr will get checked out at Stanford University this week , and that he wo n t be with the Warriors until he is feeling well enough to be coaching . Kerr was , however , in contact with Mike Brown , who has been filling in as head coach in Kerr s absence , after the Jazz took a 3-2 lead over the Los Angeles Clippers . The winner of that series will face the Warriors in the second round . Kerr traveled with the Warriors to Portland , Ore. , where they finished off the Portland Trail Blazers in a four-game sweep . But Kerr did not coach in either of the games in the Pacific Northwest , because he was experiencing symptoms . He did not go into detail on what he was feeling only that he was in pain . He was well enough to meet with his staff and Brown , and to address media once on Sunday afternoon to provide updates on his condition . Steve is going to be a part of this process all the time , Brown told the Associated Press . Really , almost before I do anything I m going to consult with him . The only time I wo n t consult with him is probably during the game , at least I do n t want the NBA to know I ve got a little chip right here [ in the neck ] that I can communicate with him in in-game situations . We ll keep him among us . Myers says that for Kerr to return , he ca n t just feel better for a day there needs to be a sustainable solution in place . Clearly , we want him back , Myers said . But I do believe in our ability , the coaching staff and our players . It s horizontal leadership here â€¦ Players have been leading , players have been talking . So , it s not necessarily a huge shift . This group of players have been tested , just by the last two years of going through the playoffs . ",

That could mean helping by being part of a trade for an established superstar , according to an L.A. Times report . The Lakers have maneuvered to be able to offer a max contract to one of this summer 's star free agents -- LeBron James and Paul George among them -- while keeping their core intact . The team is n't shopping any key players , but , according to the report , the Lakers have made it clear that they will listen to offers for anyone on the roster , even young stars Lonzo Ball , Kyle Kuzma , Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart , if it helps them fast-forward the rebuilding process . Team president Magic Johnson declined to answer a question about whether he would trade away any of the team 's young assets last month . One player who could hit the trade market is San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard , who played just nine games this season and appears to be at odds with the franchise . Landing a star two-way player like Leonard in a sign-and-trade could tempt the Lakers to deal one or more of their burgeoning players . Leonard has two seasons -- one a player option -- remaining on the five-year , $ 90 million extension he signed with San Antonio in the summer of 2015 . He is eligible for a five-year , $ 219 million supermax extension this summer . -- Field Level Media",

		"paragraph": "If you ve followed the name Paul George as it swept through headlines and tweets and columns and mobile alerts over the past five months , you re probably aware that George is a free agent next summer , and you re probably equally aware that George has a likely destination . USA Today â€˜ s Sam Amick has written on multiple occasions that George is hell-bent on playing for the Los Angeles Lakers . Word has made its way throughout the league as well , seeping through to front office executives and ownership . According to ESPN s Zach Lowe , teams believe there is at least a 75 percent chance George stays true to his LA plans . But how does George see it ? He addressed the scuttlebutt head-on for the first time since his trade to Oklahoma City in an interview with Sports Illustrated s Lee Jenkins , and his take is that the Lakers talk has been overstated . Here s his full quote : George s general sentiment is clearly stated . He loves LA , and still feels a connection to his hometown . But , first and foremost , he wants to win . After all , that s why he decided to leave Indiana . George touched on that in his interview with Jenkins , too : It is important to hear this from George , because without his voice , assumptions about his free agency preferences had run rampant . And there were consequences that came along with those assumptions namely , that they dragged George s trade value down into the bargain bin , enabling Oklahoma City s fleecing of Indiana . The manner in which he engineered his Pacers exit had also drawn criticism locally . To hear the explanation straight from George s mouth was refreshing . But George s point that his desire to play for the Lakers has been overstated should not automatically quell speculation about his future . There is now a distinct divide between his public statements and the general feeling around the league . If NBA teams believe there is a greater than 75 percent chance that George winds up in Los Angeles next summer , as Lowe reported , that opinion is n t unsubstantiated . General managers and front-office personnel do n t just blindly believe what they read on the internet . They do n t just roll with rumors . Their intelligence on the matter is presumably as thorough as anybody s . It might even be more trustworthy , therefore , than George s own word . That s because there are likely other motives behind George s statement . It s unhealthy for a player to arrive in a new city to play for a new franchise with the overwhelming sentiment swirling overhead that the player is only there as a one-year rental . George needed to quell that by talking up the possibility of a long-term stay in Oklahoma City . But his efforts to do so were riddled with hypotheticals . He prefaces his I d be dumb to leave OKC scenario with , If we get a killer season in Oklahoma , we make the conference finals or upset the Warriors or do something crazy â€¦ Before he fantasizes about recruiting a third star to Oklahoma City , he says , Hopefully me and Russ do a good enough job and make it to the conference finals and love the situation . His qualifiers are far from guarantees . Some of them even seem unlikely to occur . George s comments are well-intentioned , and his thoughts are well articulated . They will hopefully stamp out some in-season discussion of his future , which everyone in Oklahoma City would probably like to avoid . And the entire Lee Jenkins story , which also includes Kevin Durant gushing about Oklahoma City to George , is well worth your time .

The unidentified source made the claims to CNN after it was first reported in the New York Times as the investigation into Mr Khashoggi s disappearance heats up . The Washington Post columnist , who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , was reportedly killed while visiting the Gulf kingdom s consulate in Istanbul . Saudi Arabia are reportedly preparing to acknowledge that Mr Khashoggi was in fact killed at the consulate , while Donald Trump said the Saudi Crown Prince denies knowledge of what happened . US media reports suggested that the kingdom may acknowledge the writer was killed at the consulate , possibly as part of a botched interrogation . Riyadh is a key ally for the West and US President Donald Trump has said it is being treated as â€˜ guilty until proven innocent . Three people killed after caravan is towed the wrong way down a busy motorway One of Britain s most prolific paedophiles has â€˜ excessive sentence cut by seven years Muslims are the target of 52 % of religious hate crime in England and Wales , police figures reveal Boris Johnson s popularity slumps to its lowest ever level , poll finds The worst British railway stations for delays have been revealed There has been growing condemnation from the West over Mr Khashoggi s reported killing . Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his G7 counterparts have said they are â€˜ very troubled by his disappearance and insist those responsible must be held to account . In the statement , the G7 foreign ministers said : â€˜ We , the G7 foreign ministers , of Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , the United States of America , and the High Representative of the European Union , affirm our commitment to defending freedom of expression and protection of a free press . â€˜ We remain very troubled by the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account . â€˜ We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough , credible , transparent , and prompt investigation , as announced . Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also called for an immediate suspension of arms trade with Saudi Arabia following Mr Khashoggi s disappearance . He said that there needs to be an international investigation into the events in Turkey , describing them as an â€˜ abominable tragedy . Details of an alleged audio recording of the killing have been set out in a Turkish newspaper , Yeni Safak , with strong ties to the Turkish government . It said Saudi Consul General Mohammed al-Otaibi was heard telling the alleged torturers to â€˜ do this outside you re going to get me in trouble . US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has arrived in Turkey after meeting King Salman and his son , the 33-year-old Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia . Following the meeting , Mr Pompeo told reporter : â€˜ They made a commitment to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that , whether they are a senior officer or official . However , no major decision is made outside of the ultra-conservative kingdom s ruling Al Saud family . Turkish officials have said police searching the Saudi consulate have found evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed there . President Trump has suggested that â€˜ rogue killers could have been involved in the case but such a move without sanction from the Saudi regime is believed to be highly unlikely by many . Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before he vanished . He visited the consulate on October 2 to obtain a document confirming he had divorced his ex-wife , in order to allow him to remarry . Saudi officials have previously described Turkish allegations that a team of 15 Saudi agents killed Mr Khashoggi as â€˜ baseless . UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has said the â€˜ inviolability or immunity of people or premises granted under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations should be waived immediately . That convention covers diplomatic immunity , as well as the idea that embassies and consulates sit on foreign soil in their host countries . She said : â€˜ Given there seems to be clear evidence that Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate and has never been seen since , the onus is on the Saudi authorities to reveal what happened to him . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told journalists on Tuesday that police sought traces of â€˜ toxic materials and suggested parts of the consulate had been recently painted .",

		"paragraph": "Bryson DeChambeau made Jim Furyk s life a good deal more complicated this past weekend . With his dominant victory at The Northern Trust the opener of the so-called PGA Tour playoffs DeChambeau made it pretty much impossible for Furyk not to name him as one of his four Ryder Cup captain s picks next Tuesday . For the record , they are so-called playoffs because how do you take something seriously when finishing T-3 at the fabulous Northern Trust earns a player more points than winning a major ? Another topic for another day . DeChambeau narrowly missed making Furyk s team on points , dropping to ninth place after the PGA Championship one spot from being an automatic qualifier . It is hardly unprecedented for captains to pass on the ninth-place finisher in the points race . In fact , Furyk ( 2014 ) is the only player to finish ninth on the U.S. points list since 2010 and make the team : Anthony Kim was ninth in 2010 Hunter Mahan finished in that spot in 2012 and Bubba Watson was last-man-out two years ago . Furyk was an automatic pick because Tom Watson reduced his team s captains picks from four to three that year . Prior to his bravura performance at Ridgewood , DeChambeau was likely to join that list . Furyk has made it clear that he thinks experience is critical on the road and DeChambeau , at 24 , will be a Ryder Cup rookie and the youngest player on the U.S. team . What s more , he is very clearly an outside-the-box thinker and U.S. captains very much want everyone inside-the-box when they walk into the U.S. team room . The minute the PGA ended with Tiger Woods 10th on the points list and Phil Mickelson 11th , they were locks to be two of Furyk s picks . Matt Kuchar , who finished 13th , was also a likely pick because of his experience and because he brings a looseness to the U.S team room that is desperately needed . Now though , Kuchar may have to play his way into the final spot during the next three tournaments because Furyk has to seriously consider Tony Finau , if only because Finau can be a birdie-making machine . If Furyk were to pick Finau , that would give the U.S. team three rookies Finau , DeChambeau and Justin Thomas . Kuchar did finish two spots ahead of Finau in the final points standings , and combined with his experience and his unique personality , that could give him an edge when Furyk announces his last pick after the BMW Championship . It s worth remembering that two years ago , the first time the Americans withheld their final pick until later in the process , that year after East Lake ( a.k.a. the Billy Horschel pick , after Horschel s back-to-back wins came too late to make the U.S. team in 2014 ) Davis Love III went with the hot hand , taking Ryan Moore over Watson . Watson had n t played especially well during the summer and Moore did capping his late run by losing a playoff in Atlanta to Rory McIlroy . Love s instinct to go with the hot player paid off : Moore played well at Hazeltine and scored the clinching point on Sunday with a come-from-behind win over Lee Westwood . Furyk will announce Woods , Mickelson and DeChambeau the day after Labor Day and then sit back and see what happens in Philadelphia before making his final decision on the Horschel pick . Europe s points list race ends this coming weekend after the European Tour 's Made in Denmark tournament . European captain Thomas Bjorn will announce his four captains picks the day after Furyk announces his first three . Europe s biggest problem at Hazeltine was a lack of experience : Darren Clarke had six rookies on his team and , playing on the road , most struggled . The notable exception was Thomas Pieters , who went 4-1 , winning three matches paired with McIlroy and his singles match . McIlroy has talked often in the last year about the fact that the experience those six players gained at Hazeltine will help next month at Le Golf National , outside of Paris . It is entirely possible , however , that only one of those players , Rafael Cabrera-Bello , will be on the team . Danny Willett , Chris Wood and Andrew Sullivan are n t in contention to make the team on points or as a captain s pick . Pieters might still be in the mix if only because of his strong play at Hazeltine , but is a long shot at best . Matthew Fitzpatrick might still have a chance if he plays well this week , but also may not make the team . As of this moment , Bjorn is going to have five rookies on his team : the mercurial Jon Rahm Tommy Fleetwood Tyrell Hatton Alex Noren and Thorbjorn Olesen . McIlroy , Francesco Molinari and Justin Rose are the only veterans who have locked up spots off the two European points lists . That means Bjorn must add experience with his captains picks : Ian Poulter , who has had an excellent comeback year and is just outside an automatic spot on the points list , is a lock . Poulter is one of the great Ryder Cup players of his generation and his fire was clearly missed in the European team room two years ago even though he was a vice captain . It s not the same when you re not playing , he said . There s only so much you can say to guys . I NEED to be playing again . He will . So will Henrik Stenson , the temperamental opposite of Poulter , but a rock in the team room , who , like Kuchar , brings a good deal of humor to the room . He and Rose have been Europe s most consistent team in recent years , and Bjorn is not going to break them up . That leaves two spots . Chances are Bjorn will overlook Sergio Garcia s terrible summer ( he did show signs of life in Greensboro ) and name him to a ninth Ryder Cup team . The Ryder Cup has always brought out the best in Garcia , dating to his debut in 1999 at The Country Club as a 19-year-old the youngest player in Cup history . Garcia teamed well with fellow Spaniard Cabrera-Bello at Hazeltine , which is why Bjorn will probably pick both or neither . In all likelihood , it will be both . The European standings could change this week and if Olesen does n t hang on to the last spot , he s probably not going to be on the team . Bjorn would probably opt for a more experienced player like Fitzpatrick , Pieters or perhaps even Paul Casey . Furyk has no such decisions to make . DeChambeau took care of that Sunday : a ninth-place points finisher who wins against a quality field by four shots after the points race is over has to be picked . So do Woods and Mickelson because , well , they re Woods and Mickelson and have played well this year . Furyk will probably announce on Tuesday that Zach Johnson will replace Woods as a vice captain unless he gets hot and grabs the last spot . That makes sense , too , because it appears likely that , with Woods likely to play for at least a few more years , the U.S. needs to start lining up a captain for the 2022 matches in Italy . Steve Stricker is going to be the captain at Whistling Straits in 2020 . Johnson would come next , followed by Mickelson at Bethpage Black in 2024 and , in all likelihood , Woods in 2026 . Pencil in DeChambeau for 2040 . Just kidding â€¦ sort of . Introducing Golf Digest All Access , a new way to improve WATCH : GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS",

		"paragraph": "Introducing a royal Modern Family ! In a PEOPLE exclusive clip of Wednesday s episode , Mitchell ( Jesse Tyler Ferguson ) and Cam ( Eric Stonestreet ) channel their inner Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in celebration of Halloween . Mitchell , wearing a full military outfit ( resembling Prince Harry s ) , walks into the Dunphy household and immediately makes his way to a visibly upset and crying Claire ( Julie Bowen ) . But in classic Modern Family fashion , he breaks the ice while struggling to hug his sister , who s sporting an impressive spider costume with legs and all . Along with a long brunette wig , Cam ( dressed as the Duchess of Sussex ) wears a pink , off-the-shoulder dress , resembling the one Markle wore during the Trooping the Colour celebrations to mark the Queen s birthday earlier this year . After Cam attempts to hug Claire , Phil ( Ty Burrell ) asks with a huge sigh of relief , Who needs a drink ? In September , co-creator Christopher Lloyd told Entertainment Weekly that a significant character on the series will die in the show s tenth ( and likely final ) season . We re handling some bigger life events in this season , he explained . We do deal with a death , which is certainly a topic that families have to deal with , and on television , it s not easy to do because that s a heavy subject . But at the same time , it would seem unusual for a family not to go through it . While Lloyd did n t offer any more hints as to the identity of the character , he shared that their death will be a moving event â€¦ that has repercussions across several episodes . It s definitely a person , not the dog , Ferguson , 43 , recently told E! News about Jay ( Ed O Neill ) and Gloria s ( Sofia Vergara ) dog Stella . Lloyd also said that while he hopes the long-running series will get picked up for another year , season 10 would serve as a fitting send-off . From our standpoint creatively we ve gotten excited writing this season and changing the lives of the characters some in a significant way and it s made us think , â€˜ Wow , there s a lot to explore in the lives of these characters , he said , adding that they re in many ways such different characters than they were five or 10 years ago when we started . So our standpoint was , â€˜ Well , if we can do another season , we may as well , he said , adding that if it winds up that we tried and just could n t make it work , we will have a great final season for sure .

		"paragraph": "I ve said it a million times lately , to myself , to my husband or to no one in particular . Sometimes I yell it up into the clouds like a scene in a movie where the camera pans straight up above the heroine , she throws her head back and screams , Something has got to give ! and it echoes across the sky . And yet , it seems the last couple years have been all about giving a little here , a little there , but never enough to make a difference . Our lives over the last 12 months have been nothing but changes , both big and small . But here am I again , screaming my plea to the heavens , Something has got ta give ! I thought last year when I gave up my job that things would soon settle down into a gentle routine . My mother had moved in with a friend several hours north and my oldest child finally had a job and a home of his own . I only had my husband and my daughter left to tend . When she came to us a week later and announced she was moving out years ahead of schedule , I convinced myself it was a good thing , her chance to establish independence and my chance to concentrate on myself . I thought my husband and I would bond in ways we never had before with all this quiet time to ourselves . Instead , I found his life went on , with work , with chores at home , with his own hobbies , while mine stood still . For the first time in my life , I was truly alone for hours and hours , day after day . I waited for heavens to open and all these wonderful retired person things to rain down upon me until I looked like a beauteous AARP advertisement . Related : The Importance of Questioning Your Doctor and Being Fully Informed It never happened . The thing you do n t realize when you retire young , due to an illness , is that those hours you dreamed of as a young mother or a busy cubicle worker go by so painfully slowly when no one is dangling a carrot above your head . Watching all the TV you ve missed , reading the pile of novels you had waiting , crocheting that long-planned blanket and volunteering at your local soup kitchen are hard work , but no one is making you do it or holds you accountable when you lay in bed all day instead . Worse even , is when your mind is willing to find work but your body declares a sick day or week , and there is no one there to say , Poor you , can I make you a bowl of soup or hold your hand while you puke ? When the days and months passed and nothing felt calmer , and no spectacular routine had established itself , I began to wonder what else I had left to give up to find a sense of normalcy again . I tried off and on with my failing health to volunteer , at various crafting past times , watching entire runs of TV shows I d missed out on . I tried gardening , making new friends and the senior water aerobics class even though I was 35 years younger than anyone else there . And yet nothing stuck . Nothing made me zippity-doo-dah happy like the old folks on Hee-Haw . Soon I began to fear that the something that had to give was so much bigger than I had ever imagined . Related : When You 're Chasing Life More Than Dreams Because of Chronic Illness , Remember This Last week , I turned to my husband and said the key phrase again , something s got ta give . He frowned , not knowing which argument I was about to resurrect and hit him with . We ve had a year of real doozies . The truth is , I said , that my disease is here to stay and we can not keep going on like this , just waiting for things to go back to normal . Things ca n t go back to normal . I ca n t be your normal version of myself anymore . So , are you saying you re giving up ? Giving up on us ? Giving up on getting better ? he asked , not understanding this huge realization I was trying explain to him . No ! Dammit , this is n t me giving up . This is me saying we can not go on like this . I , for sure , can not go on like this . This is me saying that things are going to have to change , and change big . As the words flowed out of me as hot and angry as my tears , I began to paint the picture for him of what I saw inside my head . I explained I could not be the same hardworking adventurous woman he married any longer or live the life we d planned together just a few short years ago . I had been to hell and back and the journey had changed me deep down to my core . I d had to change to survive this grueling experience , but now I could n t turn back . My empty purposeless days were slowly killing me as I waited for life to return as it was before . Everything I thought I knew about myself had been effectively stripped away , down to the bone , leaving me vulnerable until I figured out who would emerge from this illness-driven cocoon . Related : The Two-Sided Coin of Existing With Chronic Illness As a young mother , my life revolved around my children . I had my first at the tender age of 16 . I went from being a student , a daughter , under my parents care to a single mom , reckless , full of bad taste and a driving need to prove the stereotype wrong . I worked hard at one job , sometimes two . I worked at good marriages , most of which turned out badly . I never considered my husbands would be left behind , that my parents would grow old or infirm , or that my kids would grow up and move away . I never dreamed the day would come where I did n t punch a clock or could n t do it all by myself . I always thought one day that my life would finally belong to me , but not like this . My illness stole those one days I dreamed about , making my fantasy retirement unachievable and rendering me useless to every around me , including myself . This brings me to my realization . You can not live in the past , nor can you live in a future you planned out as a na ve little girl . My life today is not about my family or my once upon a time dreams . My life today , for better or worse , centers around my chronic illness . Whether I like it or not , it may not define me , but it defines how I have to live . My life has to change from the last year of bitter resentment and broken dreams to tomorrow s achievable goals and renewed inspiration . This means when something has to give , it might be more expensive than I can afford , but that the risk of standing still will bankrupt me or worse . I live on a quiet farm in a quiet town . My sleepy little province does n t have support groups for people like me in chronic pain . Our tiny hospital is the pits and I would n t trust them to save a dandelion , much less the life of someone with such complex issues as mine . Our list of doctors are like a revolving door of under-qualified and often overworked professionals . I can no longer work and even if I could , there are so few places that would hire someone as unstable as me . This means six out of seven days , I stay at home , inside my little ranch style house , watching the paint peel . Or maybe instead , I make one of my weekly four hour round-trip journeys to the nearest metropolitan area to visit my various doctors . If their offices offer support groups , this means I need to make that same long arduous journey into the city to attend them and the likelihood of making new friends that understand my country life is small . God help me on the days I can not drive myself and someone has to take off work and chauffeur me . What this means is we are being forced to confront another big change due to my disease . The dream farm my husband and I bought only five short years ago does not suit the disabled woman I have become . The teamwork in running tractors and raising crops is beyond my capabilities . I need a close medical network and support groups of others like me to survive this new life ahead of me . I need him to compromise with me , to take these old dreams and trade them in for a sustainable life . It s unfair and I know it ll take time for him to adjust . I remind him he has a choice , even if I do not . But this is who I am becoming , a woman with different needs , who requires a different kind of support . I know it sucks , I tell him earnestly , but something has to give . I know , he says just like he did last year when I quit my job , or the year before when I underwent several experimental surgeries , or yesterday when we gave up one more luxury I can no longer share with him . He knows this could mean a new town , a new kind of treatment , or something off the wall he does n t even want to entertain . The camera pans up over our heroine and her husband and the screen goes dark . Their words echo across the night sky . No one gets to know what happens next , including us , but something has to give .

It s from 1999 , Dave s Top 10 list of Donald Trump s Campaign Slogans . Huh ? you say . Well , in 1999 Trump began an exploratory effort to become the presidential candidate for the Reform Party . He announced it , of course , on television not descending the Trump Tower escalator as he did in 2015 , but during an appearance on CNN s Larry King Live . Trump employed longtime and still-active weasel Roger Stone as his campaign strategist , but Trump dropped out of the race after coming to the conclusion he could not win with a third-party candidacy . Not before winning the California and Michigan primaries , however a specter of things to come . The list here is remarkably timely ( No. 10 : He ll make our national defense as impenetrable as his hair ) and the No. 1 answer is especially accurate and chilling . These days , the retired Letterman has made it clear what he thinks of Trump , coming out of his old-man cave to declare our new president a damaged human being and a person to be shunned . By the way , that joke Dave makes in 1999 about Oprah Winfrey being his ideal vice-presidential running mate ? Turns out , that was n t a joke , but truth once more : Trump told the press that Oprah would be his ideal running mate .

Mike Ullery Jr. was on his way to a high school football game last Friday in Midland , Mich. , when he spotted the boys . Even though they were already running late for the game , Ullery said the boys came to a sudden halt when they heard the pregame national anthem begin to play . Stunned by their act of patriotism , Ullery snapped a photo of the boys standing with their hands over their hearts . I was impressed by these Bullock Creek boys .

		"paragraph": "Draymond Green s numbers are down to start the 2016-17 season , but his elite versatility has been no less important to the Golden State Warriors than it was over the two previous record-breaking seasons . His ability to run the offense as a big man continues to open up new options for Golden State s league-leading attack , and his willingness to defend all five positions ensures that the Warriors can switch with impunity . The team certainly remains a work-in-progress with Kevin Durant and a new bench rotation , but Green is surely helping that process move along relatively speedily . It s no mistake that they entered Monday s home game against the Atlanta Hawks with 11 wins in a row and the league s best record at 15-2 . [ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry ] Atlanta succeeded in frustrating the hosts and playing most of the game at its preferred slower pace , but Golden State exerted their dominance in a tremendous fourth quarter that saw the visitors score just 19 points . Green was the single biggest reason for that game-winning shift , coming through with two blocks in the final 45 seconds to seal a 105-100 win . Most impressively , he showed his versatility by swatting two different players : These two plays are the perfect examples of why Green is the most versatile defensive player in the NBA . In the first play , he switches onto the very quick Dennis Schr der as a center and manages to keep him in front of him despite several attempts to shake him . In the second , Green meets rangy wing Kent Bazemore near the hoop as the last line of defense and strips him for a turnover on the recovery . There are maybe only one or two other players in the league who could make these plays in so short a time . Add in Green s strengths as a defensive communicator , and it s hard to deny his talents . [ Follow Dunks Do n t Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] The other numbers were not there for Green on Monday ( four points on 2-of-9 FG , seven assists , three rebounds in 39 minutes ) , but that was true for most of the Warriors key players . The Hawks league-best defense frustrated a Warriors offense that had been electric for several weeks with tough interior play from the likes of Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap , to the point where it seemed like this contest would throw lots of cold water on the idea that Golden State was just shy of juggernaut status . The only Warrior to have anything like an excellent game was Andre Iguodala ( 12 points on 5-of-9 FG , five assists , five rebounds ) , whose plus-18 in only 28 minutes was more than double Green s second-best plus-8 . That poor form turned around in the fourth quarter , but it s worth noting that the Warriors are still very dangerous even when things are n t going their way . Stephen Curry ( 25 points on 4-of-11 3FG ) , Kevin Durant ( 25 points on 8-of-16 FG ) , and Klay Thompson ( 20 points on 8-of-18 FG ) all finished with at least 20 points despite long periods of difficulty , and the Warriors still put up 25 assists on 37 assists . These are numbers that many teams would take as evidence of strong balance that the Warriors see them as below average speaks volumes about their current ceiling , let alone what they could eventually become . Plus , the defense showed that it can be plenty stingy when called upon . Green s blocks were the clear highlights , but holding the Hawks to 41.9 percent shooting from the field and a 7-of-29 mark from deep is a mark of strong play over 48 minutes . For all the talk about their iffy defense so far this season , the Warriors have given up the eighth-fewest points per 100 possessions in the NBA . The offense deservedly gets most of the attention , but Golden State has proven it can win in several ways . Opponents will continue to pursue and certainly find new ways of stopping them , but the Warriors are already a serious problem after just one month together .

		"paragraph": " Prepare your complaints . One week after the announcement of the starters for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans , the league revealed the contest 's West and East reserves , as selected by NBA coaches , Thursday night on TNT . The team is the usual mix of established superstars , soon-to-be household names , and first-time selections . Naturally , there are also some snubs and deserving players left off the list . We 'll start with the West , a far deeper conference with more difficult choices to join starters Stephen Curry , Kobe Bryant , Kevin Durant , Kevin Love , and Blake Griffin . The backcourt reserves include Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul ( 7th selection ) , Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard ( 1st ) , San Antonio Spurs mainstay Tony Parker ( 6th ) , and Houston Rockets scorer James Harden ( 2nd ) . The frontcourt boasts Harden 's teammate Dwight Howard ( 8th ) , Lillard 's pick-and-roll partner LaMarcus Aldridge ( 3rd ) , and Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki ( 12th ) . The East , which currently has just five teams with more wins than losses , features a less star-laden list of reserves alongside starters Kyrie Irving , Dwyane Wade , Paul George , LeBron James , and Carmelo Anthony . The backcourt has Washington Wizards point guard John Wall ( 1st ) , Brooklyn Nets shooting guard Joe Johnson ( 7th ) , and Toronto Raptors scorer DeMar DeRozan ( 1st ) . The frontcourt comprises Miami Heat big man Chris Bosh ( 9th ) , Atlanta Hawks forward Paul Millsap ( 1st ) , Chicago Bulls big man Joakim Noah ( 2nd ) , and Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert ( 2nd ) . The vast majority of these selections were reported by Yahoo 's own Adrian Wojnarowksi and Marc Spears before Thursday 's announcement . For those counting , the All-Star Game will have five first-time selections , with only Curry serving as a starter from that group . Kobe has the most All-Star selections with 16 . The Miami Heat are the only team with three All-Stars , while the Indiana Pacers , Portland Trail Blazers , and Los Angeles Clippers each placed two players . Many West players deserved inclusion , with Anthony Davis of the host New Orleans Pelicans , Goran Dragic of the Phoenix Suns , Mike Conley on the Memphis Grizzlies , and DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings standing out . However , it 's difficult to refer to any of these players as snubs in such a crowded field . The silver lining is that Bryant ( and potentially Paul ) could be replaced due to injury , which could give another first-timer a chance to soak in the All-Star experience . Filling out the East roster with protoypical All-Stars proved a difficult task for many analysts , but some of the selections were quite surprising . DeRozan 's backcourt mate Kyle Lowry looked like a more deserving candidate , and the Nets ' disappointing start made most observers argue that versatile Indiana Pacers wing Lance Stephenson deserved inclusion over Joe Johnson . Arron Afflalo of the Orlando Magic was another common pick in the run-up to Thursday 's selection . As reported by Yahoo 's Adrian Wojnarowski , Johnson over Lowry was the closest pick in the conference . The All-Star Game itself will take place on February 16 in New Orleans . The winning team earns nothing of tangible value , because it is a fun exhibition game that proves very little . - - - - - - - Eric Freeman is a writer for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "By Delphine Schrank MANAGUA ( Reuters ) - A thuggish response to weeks of protests has eroded carefully constructed pillars of support in the Church , military and business world for Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega , emboldening calls for the ouster of the former Marxist guerrilla who has dominated politics for decades . More than a month after changes to the Central American nation 's social security system triggered student-led protests , indignation at a brutal crackdown in which at least 77 people have been killed and over 800 wounded has morphed into a daily challenge to Ortega 's rule . Protesters demand he step down , while regional diplomatic body the Organization of American States said last week he should hold early elections . He has as yet shown no sign of heeding that call , which could end one of the longest standing leftist governments in Latin America , a staunch ally for socialist Venezuela . It will be not easy for the loose alliance of students , farmers , politicians and academics to dislodge Ortega , 72 , who was re-elected in 2016 with nearly three-quarter of the votes after limiting opposition participation . But the Sandinista leader , whose office acknowledged a request for comment on this story but provided no immediate response , looks more isolated and fragile than at any other time in his current 11-year tenure as president . Support from the Catholic Church and the private sector is wavering . There is visible discomfort in the military , a solidly Sandinista organization constructed by Ortega 's brother from the original rebel army that overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1970s . Even though the government backpedaled on the social security measures after five days , pent-up discontent exploded . \" This is a civic revolution , unprecedented in my country , \" said Violeta Granera , a sociologist who ran as an opposition vice presidential candidate against Ortega in 2016 . The protests , she said , were nothing less than \" a national demand for a total change in the economic , political and social system . \" The latest sign of fracturing came on Wednesday , when after just four days of talks , Nicaragua 's Episcopal Council of Catholic bishops suspended a \" national dialogue \" that had widely been seen as a chance for Ortega to take the wind out of the protests by making small concessions . The Church had fallen behind its former adversary when he embraced Christianity before his 2007 return to office as a more moderate figure who avoided hostilities with Washington and business leaders . Yet , in a pointed assessment , Silvio Jose Baez , an auxiliary archbishop of Managua , said the government had failed to embrace the dialogue 's agenda of \" democratization of the country . \" On Monday , a smaller group of government , private sector and church representatives restarted talks behind closed doors . Students and government authorities agreed in the first days of talks to a truce that quickly fell apart when groups of youths attacked protesters entrenched at the Agrarian University of Nicaragua , badly wounding at least two people . Dr. Carlos Tunnermann Bernheim , an education minister during Ortega 's first term as president in the 1980s and now a vocal critic participating in the talks , called the violence \" a grave violation \" of terms agreed in the talks . Every day since , flag-bearing Nicaraguans have poured through cities and towns . Thousands took to the streets again on Saturday . At night , protesters hunker behind barricades of brick pulled up from the streets or walls of chairs and desks on university campuses , bracing with homemade mortars for clashes with pro-Ortega gangs whom witnesses and rights groups blame for many of the casualties . PARALYSIS Daily highway blockades have snarled transportation across the country , as students and farmers erect makeshift barricades to damage the economy and wear down the government . The government estimates the turmoil has cost the economy some $ 250 million . Despite the losses , many in the private sector are openly backing protesters and demanding change , turning against Ortega after an uneasy alliance in recent years that has undergirded strong economic growth . In its most explicit move yet , the Superior Council of Private Enterprise in Nicaragua , which represents the private sector , called Sunday on businesses to \" join the clamor of mothers , grandmothers and wives who demand justice for the murder of their loved ones \" in a march on Wednesday . \" Nobody expected this violence to be the way it was and we all find it disgusting , \" said Mario Arana , a former central bank chief and analyst of the private sector . Arana said that as it dawned on business leaders that police were shooting to maim or kill , with rubber bullets aimed directly at eyes , chests , and heads , or even with live ammunition , \" then things began to change for everybody . \" Arana 's version of events chimes with the investigations of two local rights groups and a report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights , which last Monday denounced grave violations of human rights characterized by the excessive force used by state security forces and armed third-parties during the protests . Following the accusations that the initial police response was indiscriminate and disproportionate , agitators in civilian clothing are now behind much of the violence against protesters , observers say . Ortega has publicly lamented the violence , saying that not only opponents , but also Sandinista supporters , bystanders and police have been killed . Ortega has consolidated his rule by neutralizing and co-opting credible opposition and stalling the development of independent institutions . His wife , Rosario Murrillo , is vice president and widely seen as a power behind the throne . But the mass mobilization has allowed politicians such as Granera to forge new alliances between civic and political groups , including her own Broad Front for Democracy , she and others said . Building an effective anti-government coalition could prove difficult , however , said Eduardo Enriquez , editor of La Prensa newspaper , one of a handful of independent media outlets . \" The longer we do n't see results , people are going to start getting tired and disappointed , \" he said . \" And they have the force , the brute force . So we do n't want to lose the momentum . \" ARMY RELUCTANCE Another base of Ortega 's support is the army . But in recent days it has signaled its refusal to appear in the streets . Privately to business leaders and then in a statement through a spokesman , senior commanders called for dialogue and said they would not repress the population . Former officers in mid-May held a meeting in the town of Masaya , southeast of Managua , a former seat of the insurrection in the 1970s against then-strongman Anastasio Somoza and site of some of the most brutal clashes of recent weeks . They spoke to a raucous gathering of protesters , beside a group painting a sidewalk tribute to the recently fallen , and a few feet from a makeshift hospital tent where volunteers treated wounded protesters who they , along with rights group and witnesses , said were denied access to government hospitals . \" All of us fought the overthrow of the dictatorship of Somoza . Then we participated in the defense of the revolution against the Contras , \" said Carlo Breles , a former Sandinista commander . \" Now we initiating a third struggle , against the dictatorship of Ortega-Murillo . \" ( Editing by Frank Jack Daniel , Frances Kerry and Tom Brown )",

		"paragraph": "If you 're heading to college this fall or even just looking to revamp your bedroom at home and are in need of some ~ royally good ~ decor inspiration , look no further than Prince Harry 's dorm room at Eton College , the boarding school near Windsor , England , where he attended high school until 2003 . Actually , on second thought , look much further than Harry 's room , since his decorating style could probably best be described as \" generic bro . \" This week , the Daily Mail resurfaced a collection of photos from Harry 's time at Eton and , though you probably wo n't pick up any style tips from the then 18-year-old , you probably will get a few hearty LOLs out of what the young prince thought constituted as tasteful wall hangings . As seen in the photos , above Harry 's desk and dresser , the royal plastered his walls with a variety of elements : Among the clutter , you can spot a large London flag a brightly colored tapestry with a cutout of a woman posing tacked to the center a snapshot of Harry with a few friends or , perhaps , his older brother Prince William and , of course , not one , but two photos of bikini-clad women . The desk and dresser are loaded with even more artifacts , including a giant stereo , a stack of photography books , a collection of teacups , and an electric toothbrush . All the necessities . Other photos show Harry shining his shoes on his bed peep his blue plaid comforter and doing some schoolwork at his desk . Rather than bikini-clad women , those workspaces are filled with more meaningful imagery , including individual photos of his parents , Prince Charles and Princess Diana , over his bed , and another framed glamour shot of Diana , who died in a car crash nearly six years before Harry 's Eton graduation , sitting on his desk . Perhaps even more striking than any of Harry 's wall hangings , however , are the clothes he 's wearing in these photos . He may look like he 's dressed for the fanciest event of the year but , in fact , that 's not even the entire daily uniform for Eton students . Traditionally , while attending classes , they wear pinstriped trousers , a white button-down shirt , a white fold-over tie or bowtie , and a vest , all under a long morning coat , the Daily Mail notes . Some of the resurfaced photos show Prince Harry exploring other areas of the Eton campus . In one , he perches on his dorm 's kitchen counter while a piece of toast pops dramatically out of a toaster . In a few other shots , Harry wears an apron and stands behind an easel , poses with two abstract paintings , and goofs off with a skeletal school pal . The latter three photos appear to have been taken in the school 's art studio the Duke of Sussex reportedly studied art during his time at Eton , eventually taking his A-level exams in that and geography though his grades reportedly were n't quite as good as those of Prince William , another Eton alum . Perhaps all that wall decor was a little too distracting to keep him focused on his studies . Related : Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Reportedly Got a Dog",

		"paragraph": "Jose Mourinho has done his whining . He has made his excuses . He has pined for more squad investment and better players . And now , after just a half-season of grousing , he has his man . He has Alexis Sanchez who was n t his man until a week ago , but nonetheless now is . He has a versatile , world-class forward in his prime . He has , per most reports , the highest-earning player in Premier League history , and one who is n t being paid for what he could do two years from now one who is being paid for what he will do right now . Mourinho , therefore , is running out of excuses to reach for . And if he were to reach for them , he d instead find his new Chilean jewel , a player whose tenure at Manchester United might just make or break his own . Sanchez , who signed for United as part of a straight-up swap for Henrikh Mkhitaryan , might not be the Red Devils best player . He might not be their most important . He will , though , play a significant role in charting the course of the Mourinho era . Mourinho eras are notoriously short and succinct . They invariably feature success , but never longevity . The Sanchez deal gibes with that timeline . Whereas Mourinho s two other massive signings were brought in as powerful but unfinished products , at 23 ( Paul Pogba ) and 24 ( Romelu Lukaku ) years old , Sanchez is what he is . And he might not be what he is for much longer . He therefore will and should up the urgency at Old Trafford , and the pressure on Mourinho . The Portuguese boss complained just last month that United s $ 400 million of spending on transfer fees over two summers was insufficient . That United was a big club , but not , in its current state , a big team . His comments sparked furious debate . With Manchester City as the reference point , they were n t necessarily wrong but they were misguided . As many pointed out at the time , City had spent more , but Pep Guardiola was doing more with what he had . He had found ways to develop and utilize the players he recruited , but also those he inherited . Mourinho has n t maximized his resources , even if those resources were n t quite as copious or exploitable as Guardiola s . That was the common criticism . The counterargument was that the talent gap truly was restrictive beyond managerial repair . With Sanchez on board , it s no longer justifiable . Mourinho can no longer cry poverty . He has sanctioned , and reportedly advocated for , the purchase of a talismanic attacker . As the Independent â€˜ s Miguel Delaney wrote , Sanchez was assured he would be the main man . He would be the star . This was key . Jose Mourinho had big plans for him . Nobody can be sure what those plans are . Mourinho could use Sanchez as a proper winger as a narrower wide forward as a Romelu Lukaku partner or even as a No. 9 . He can give him freedom or specific instructions . He can utilize him in any gameplan , against any opponent , in any situation . He can drill him into one role , or concoct new ones every week . Mourinho is no longer restricted . Which is why this signing , and the 18 months that follow , will be so telling . Mourinho , as he slips toward the first sophomore season sans domestic title of his managerial career , has been questioned not as a temperamental figurehead or behind-the-scenes decision maker , but rather as a football coach as a teacher and tactician . Sanchez s first few years in Manchester will answer those questions , in one way or another . Henry Bushnell covers global soccer , and occasionally other ball games , for Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "Kevin Costner s lost scenes in the 1983 classic The Big Chill have become a part of movie lore in the years since its release ( the film turns 35 on Sunday ) , heard about but never seen . Unknown at the time , the future Dances With Wolves Oscar winner played Alex , the suicide victim whose death reunites eight college friends ( Tom Berenger , Glenn Close , Jeff Goldblum , William Hurt , Kevin Kline , Mary Kay Place , Meg Tilly , and JoBeth Williams ) . Director Lawrence Kasdan , however , cut all of Costner s scenes from the film . Or at least those that showed his face the actor s slashed wrists are visible in the opening sequence as a mortician maneuvers his corpse . During a recent Role Recall interview with Yahoo Entertainment ( watch in full below ) , Goldblum described in great , Goldblum-esque detail what was originally intended to be a pivotal flashback scene featuring Costner as Alex. We shot this whole flashback â€¦ in Atlanta , and we shot it first , when we re all together in our college days , Goldblum said . We re all making a Thanksgiving dinner . Kevin Costner s character was in the kitchen with a sharp object that finally he did himself in with about to cut the turkey . And he was going to cut this perfect turkey . It was poetical , and metaphorical . He s about to cut this perfect turkey , and we were all there kind of having a good time , and I think Glenn Close s character says , â€˜ Hey Alex. We need you in here . And he s there , and he ca n t bring himself to cut the turkey . It s whole , and it s kind of perfect . And he does n t want to do it . As Goldblum suggested , it was a clever bit of reverse foreshadowing , as well as multidimensional character-building when it came to Alex , who ultimately we re only told about by his friends . Then we saw the movie , and for one reason or another , they decided not to use it , Goldblum said . But [ Costner ] was wonderful .

For a few more nuggets to tide us over during the wait for that Oct. 23 return , we talked to executive producer and Season 7 premiere director Greg Nicotero about the aforementioned season preview , as well as his hot new road trip-sparking restaurant ( co-owned with Norman Reedus and TWD creator Robert Kirkman ) , the new Walking Dead attraction that opened at Universal Studios Hollywood this summer , and the idea he and showrunner Scott Gimple have for a very special TWD movie theater marathon . Nicotero , a 2016 Emmy nominee along with the series special makeup effects team , also shared with Yahoo TV his memories of Rick Grimes s Season 1 home which is now available for purchase for any fan willing and able to pony up a cool $ 629,000 and gave us an update on TWD Glitter Prank War 2016 . The Comic-Con Season 7 trailer is excellent . I think fans knew not to expect any reveals about Negan s victim , but you gave us this other great surprise with introducing Ezekiel and Shiva , and showing a little bit of what we re going to see with the other characters . Was that something you had planned all along as a treat for everyone waiting for that cliffhanger resolution in October?Absolutely . Scott [ Gimple ] and I talked a lot about the trailer , and we compared it to a Star Wars movie . This is very important , because the minute that I say Star Wars and Walking Dead in the same sentence â€¦ I got called an a hole last year , a pretentious a hole , by fans who thought that I was saying that The Walking Dead is as good as Star Wars , which is not what I was saying . I said , You know , the cliffhanger s kind of like the way Empire Strikes Back ended and you found out that Darth Vader was Luke s father . People were like , \" You re a moron . Anyway , what I meant was , it s a promise of new worlds . Every time you watch any of those cool Star Wars trailers , you really do n t get much of a sense of what the movie s about â€¦ it s a promise of new creatures , new characters , and new worlds . We went into this trailer for Season 7 with exactly that intent . That s all we wanted to do , we wanted the promise of new worlds , so you see a little bit of The Sanctuary , you see a little bit of The Kingdom , you see a little bit of The Hilltop , you see a little bit of Alexandria . You start getting a sense of these different worlds . I directed the episode where The Kingdom is introduced , and it was a blast . I was excited . I loved the idea that it was like shooting a pilot . I got to introduce a whole new series of characters and play with Shiva and Khary Payton , who plays Ezekiel . And there s the first half of the trailer , which reminds us again how harsh that cliffhanger resolution is going to be.Listen , shooting that first episode , the Season 7 premiere , was without a doubt the most emotionally grueling and draining nine days . There was nothing fun about it . It was rough , really rough . As far as the way that I looked at it , it was reducing these people at the end of [ Season 6 ] to the absolute lowest point that you can ever imagine them . They re all defeated , they ve lost . We ve never seen Rick Grimes scared in six years . There has never been fear on his face , but we end Season 6 â€¦ Rick is so scared that he is helpless . These are two things that you never see in your hero . Imagine a hero that s scared and helpless . Where do you go from there ? Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead Season 7 Trailer : All the Negan Victim Hints We Found and Introducing Ezekiel The season premiere really redefines grief . It redefines pain , and emotion , and if you think watching the finale that you are already at rock bottom with these people , you ve got a lot further to go . This season s intense . There s not really a lot of let up . The show continues to get darker , and that s something that we had always planned from day one , is that we want the show to be dark , and we want the show to be different . With the introduction of Negan , it gives us the perfect palate and the perfect opportunity to explore something that we ve never explored before . The world is a much , much bigger place . You have a guy like Rick who ends Season 6 with , Oh yeah , if they want to deal , you just tell them to come talk to me â€¦ For him to be in the position that he s left in , on his knees â€¦ it s rough . OK , we re going to be in a dark place a lot with the new season , so for now , back to happier happenings . Congratulations on your new restaurant in Senoia , Nic & Norman s . Norman told us there is sometimes a three-hour wait for a table . Did you expect it to be such a success right away?No . We just had the thought , \" Oh , it would be really fun to have a place that we could go and hang out and have dinner and drink some stuff . It went from that to this place where people wait in line for three hours . How often have you guys been able to go?I go a lot , actually . I go twice a week probably . To check out business , or because it s your local hang now?A little bit of both . The nice thing is there s a lot of fans who like to go there and express their enthusiasm . It s fun , it s a cool place . I own a bar , a restaurant . I mean , come on . Is that something you d always wanted to do?I always used to think I wanted to own a pizza parlor . Like , Oh , it d be a pizza parlor that would have all kinds of cool props from all the movies that I had worked on . This was even before Planet Hollywood had been created . Then Planet Hollywood comes out and goes , Yeah , it s going to be a burger joint with a lot of props and stuff around . I was like , Oh , well , I must have been on to something there . [ This came from ] a conversation that Norman and I had several years ago when we started shooting down here in Senoia . We were like , You know , it would be great to have a place that we could go to where we could sort of pay tribute to the cast and the crew . There were n t a lot of places to eat down here back then . There were like two restaurants . I d shared that with a couple people locally , and when [ this building ] became available , I got a call from [ Raleigh Studios president ] Scott Tigchelaar , who s one of the co-owners , and he said , Hey , I remember you mentioning to me that you and Norman were interested in some sort of venture like this . Is that still the case ? I called Norman and I m like , Dude , I think we might have an opportunity to own a restaurant . Next thing I knew , we were writing checks , and here we are .

I do feel a unique connection to this area . We ve been shooting here for seven years . I ve been doing this since â€˜ 84 . It s been 32 years , so a quarter of my career I ve spent here . Are you hearing that people are road-tripping to the restaurant this summer?People are coming from all over the place , for sure . I ve had a lot of people tell me , I drove three hours . I drove four hours . I drove from upstate New York , Nashville , Texas , Florida . It does n t hurt that we re in production . I think people also hope that they can come by and happen to drive past where we re filming , or people from the show will go to the restaurant . I think when we re in production , there s definitely an increased appetite for the restaurant . Ha ha , appetite . Are you thinking at all about expanding ? Could this become a chain?Yes . I think we ve already talked about opening another one of these somewhere else . Robert Kirkman is also a partner in the restaurant , and a couple of times , he s like , \" What are we waiting for ? Let s go . Start popping these things up everywhere . It s pretty funny . You could open one outside The Walking Dead attraction that opened at Universal Studios Hollywood this summer.It would make sense to walk out of Universal and get a Nic & Norman s burger . Whose is better , by the way , your burger or Norman s ? I have a confession to make : I have n t tasted Norman s yet . From what I understand , people seem to like my burger . It s not a competition , but I m winning . Back to the Universal attraction , people seem to be surprised at just how frightened they are when they go through it , and you ve included so many props and callbacks to the show . Can you envision a point where that might expand ? Could The Walking Dead spark its own amusement park?I would love the idea of a Walking Dead amusement park , how cool would that be ? I was tremendously pleased with the results of the permanent attraction , because we had to deal with the Halloween Horror Nights mazes . You have to figure that we had a little competition amongst ourselves , because people had already seen the maze . Between myself , and John Murdy and his team at Universal , we really had to up the ante . When you re waiting in the queue , and you re going through the hospital and you re looking at all the little Easter eggs that we ve hidden around there , plus the sheer extent of the number of zombies and things that are in there , to me , it s really fun . I was pleasantly , pleasantly surprised at how much fun it was . I wanted to go through it like two or three more times . The beauty of it is that we do have opportunities to expand it . We do n t want the attraction to ever feel like it s outdated . The opportunity to upgrade it by seeing either other characters or walkers from more recent moments in recent seasons , I think would be great . You and I had talked last season about how you and Scott have wanted to show some of the episodes in a movie theater , make it a fan event with a marathon screening and cast Q&A s between episodes â€¦ The Night of The Walking Dead . Is that something that still may happen?It is indeed . I think there was some discussion about it . I think the trick really is , when do you do it ? Doing it leading up to a premiere is one idea . The other idea would be to have fans vote on their favorite episode of a season , and then just do a from dusk â€˜ til dawn kind of thing . That idea was very well received . I just do n t know when it would happen , if it would be during the hiatus , or maybe before we go off the air next season for our Season 7 finale . I do n t know , but it s something that Scott and I love the idea of , and we pitched it to AMC , and they seemed to like the idea a lot . We just have to figure out the logistics of it all . Speaking of the premiere , the show , for the last couple of years , has premiered the same weekend as New York Comic Con . But Season 7 premieres a couple of weeks after NYCC this year . You had also mentioned last year wanting to have a premiere in London at some point â€¦ I think because of the cliffhanger nature of the episode , you ca n t really show it early . The minute you show it early , [ the reveal is ] out . I have a sneaking suspicion anything we do would probably be on the night of the actual premiere . There s a lot of stuff still up in the air . We ve been so busy just making the show . The fact that we all went to [ San Diego ] Comic-Con , we re like , Oh , that s right . Now I remember what it s like to have a life out there for a couple of minutes . It was nice . I ll tell you , the response , the fans â€¦ it was overwhelming . The people were great . I think Norman s glitter prank , it certainly did a tremendous amount for making our actors somewhat even more accessible by the ridiculous childish nature of pulling pranks and how much fun they had . And the fact that Andy [ Lincoln ] tried to prank Norman back and screwed it up and blew glitter in his own face . I was going to ask you about that . Has Glitter Prank War escalated?Oh , yeah . This has been going on for years . I will say Norman is really good at it . Norman will think about a good prank for a long time , and he ll play it all out . Andy did n t really have that glitter thing quite dialed in . It s kind of fun to be in the middle of those two â€¦ I m usually in the middle of it . I kind of hear from both sides what they re planning , so it s hilarious . I m like , Well , that will never work , but that ll work . You re the advisor to both sides?I do n t know if I m an advisor to both sides , but I m certainly a confidante to both sides . With your special effects and makeup skills you could probably put a decisive end to this , could n t you?If I answer that , all targets will be on me . I will tell you that Steven [ Yeun ] is up there , too . He s right up there with some pretty f king great s t. There should be a video documenting the history of these pranks . You know , we do need to do that , as a matter of fact . Norman and I talked last night about a particular idea . Related : â€˜ Fear the Walking Dead Cast Shares Their Ideas on Surviving , Dying , and Pranking in the Zombie Apocalypse In another TWD moment this summer , we found out the house used as the Grimes family home in Season 1 is for sale . Do you have any special memories from that location ? It was the spot where Rick and Morgan s friendship began.It was . Yeah , I m a very nostalgic guy . Every time I drive up to Atlanta or any time I go past somewhere that we shot , I feel a connection to these places . I feel like part of me is there forever . I will never forget standing in the middle of the road and shooting in that neighborhood . I think one of our first zombies we shot in that neighborhood , when Rick sees the zombie and is waving him down , and then Morgan knocks him out . I remember sitting under the trees in the park across the street and talking to the guy about his zombie walk . I remember being outside of all those houses , and we had a couple of zombies that we wanted barefoot , and then realizing that those poor people s feet were going to bake to the road because it was so hot . You re doing the Walker Stalker Cruise again this year . What is the experience of being on a cruise ship with thousands of Walking Dead fans like?I had a really good time . I would say the first night was probably the most challenging , because Norman and I did our panel at 11 o clock at night on the back deck with 2,000 people . People sending shots of tequila on stage â€¦ and I think I learned my lesson that night . It was really fun . For the most part , our fans are so respectful , and they re really happy to say hello and tell you how much they love the show , and they respect your work and admire your work . We had a really good time . This year it s you , Norman , Michael Cudlitz , Tom Payne , Michael Traynor , and Chandler Riggs , as well , right ? Yeah . I think we need some girls . I m not sure who else is going , but I think we need some girls . The Walking Dead Season 7 premieres Oct. 23 at 9 p.m. on AMC .",

		"paragraph": "Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein says we re in a period where the consensus is that things are going to go very well for the economy in the near term . Presently , interest rates , while rising , are low relative to economic growth we re experiencing . Meanwhile , energy prices are fairly low , and more fiscal stimulus has been added to the economy , Blankfein noted . That said , there s still a risk to acknowledge . The risk is and there s always a risk side is that things go a little too well , get a little hot , he said . The Fed , fulfilling its obligations , tries to forestall runaway inflation by raising interest rates faster than anybody thinks . And if they do that â€¦ that will be a little bit jarring for people . It may cause people to seize up . The Federal Reserve mandates include promoting price stability and full employment . But in its efforts , it certainly does n t want to accidentally upset the markets and send the economy spiraling . The delicate balance that the Federal Reserve has to do is kind of get interest rates up while they are simultaneously saying , â€˜ Well , not too fast . Do n t worry . Slow , ' he said . And if the market gets a little upset , they say , â€˜ Well , we can wait a little longer . In other words , it s a delicate thing to ease out of this period where they really , really kind of have easy money policy , and that s what we ve had and still have , but you ca n t do that forever . The Fed has to find a way to normalize and doing so where the cure does n t kill the patient . That s the exercise taking place now . My base case is that it works .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the What Happened on Exile , Stays on Exile episode of Survivor : Game Changers contains spoilers . Wednesday night s episode of Survivor contained some very sensitive subject matter , and it s too important to brush over in a standard recap . So just a warning , this recap wo n t be focused on pizza rewards and gags about Debbie s delusions . It s a topic that requires some proper thought and context , and while as a straight white male I m far from the most qualified to talk about these matters , I m going to try . For those who did n t see the episode , at Tribal Council , Jeff Varner outed fellow contestant Zeke Smith as transgender . Not only did he out Zeke in front of the other tribemates , but in front of millions of viewers across America . His actions were met with such disgust and horror that he was n t even afforded the dignity of being voted out , he was essentially made to leave . It s perhaps the most reprehensible moment in the show s history , and there s a lot to unravel . Survivor â€˜ s LGBT Past Over the years , reality TV has played a significant role in altering the public perception of transgressive sexuality . The warts-and-all convention of the genre has allowed audiences a deeper look into the diverse representations of the LGBT community . While it would be a fallacy to say the portrayals have all been positive , the salient point is that the genre helped increase the visibility of queer sexuality on prime-time television . Survivor itself contributed massively to the public discourse on sexual difference . Back in 2000 , the N.Y. Post declared that Survivor [ had ] dethroned Will & Grace as the funniest show on TV about homosexuality , citing the odd-couple relationship between the openly gay corporate trainer Richard Hatch and 72-year-old Navy vet Rudy Boesch . The cunning and deceitful Hatch would go on to win the first season with over 50 million Americans watching at home . Peter Nardi , a former president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , said that Hatch s involvement in Survivor marked significant changes in television . What strikes me about Survivor is that the talk about Richard has been about his personality not the fact that he is gay , Nardi said , contrasting Hatch s multifaceted depiction to a former Real World contestant whose entire identity on the show was simply the gay character . Survivor had broken new ground when it came to the portrayal of LGBT people on TV . Jeff Varner Arrives It was shortly after Hatch s victory , at the height of Survivor â€˜ s popularity , that Jeff Varner , the man at the center of tonight s drama , appeared in the show s second season . While sexuality was just one part of the conversation in Season 1 , it became a big focus in the fan community during The Australian Outback despite the season featuring no openly gay contestants ( at least not referenced on screen ) . However , the absence of the gay character only ignited speculation from fans about who was the Richard Hatch of the season . Jeff , the snarky Internet projects manager , was one of the players at the forefront of that conjecture . Jeff never broached the subject of his sexuality on screen . In fact , last week s episode was the first reference to him being gay over his three Survivor appearances . There s a lot of people in my life that do n t know I m gay they are learning that right now , he said in a bonus confessional . Jeff never defined himself by his sexuality nor did he need to , yet in Season 2 , people almost felt like they had a right to know . He was even put on the spot on The Howard Stern Show , asked directly by Stern himself , Are you gay ? But we need only look at Jeff s cagey answer to understand the complications of asking someone such a question in such a public forum . It was cringeworthy , awkward , and possibly even dangerous . Regardless of how far we ve come concerning LGBT rights , it s a community that is still stigmatized and maligned in certain sections of society including North Carolina ( Jeff s home ) . We live in a world where gay and transgendered people are still beaten and murdered at an alarmingly frequent rate . So when you out someone on any terms but their own you are committing a reckless act of insensitivity . You re ripping away their protection and throwing them in front of potential hatred and discrimination . There is no telling the damaging consequences it could have on that person s life , their family , friends , relationships , jobs , etc . It s what makes Jeff s actions in this episode so much more complicated , confusing , and ultimately , wrong . What Would You Do for a Million Dollars ? So why did Jeff do what he did ? Jeff s mouth has certainly gotten him into trouble before ( We ve got a rat ! ) , but he s never shown malicious intent . He s always been a compelling Survivor character , a wonderful narrator who peppers his confessionals with wit and humor . Yes , sometimes he can be a little crazed and erratic , but he s never been hurtful . I ve always enjoyed watching Jeff , and I have no doubt he deeply regrets what he did , but that does not excuse the fact that he did it . The expression desperate times call for desperate measures springs to mind when considering his shameful actions at Tribal Council . Jeff has never made the jury phase of the game during his time playing Survivor , and after being swapped last week and losing his closest ally , Sandra , his life in the game was in a precarious position . He was willing to do and say absolutely anything that he thought would help him survive three more days . But it s difficult to comprehend just what was going through his mind when he decided to make this move . Did he suddenly expect everyone to see Zeke as a liar and boot him out ? When a distraught Andrea asked what his goal was , Jeff explained it was to show the deception . It reveals the ability to deceive . There is no earthly way to defend that . It s an utterly invidious act that feeds into every negative stereotype of trans people that they should n t be trusted and have ulterior motives . Former Survivor winner Boston Rob once asked rhetorically , What would you do for a million dollars ? Survivor is definitely not a shining beacon of humanity and togetherness players lie , cheat , manipulate , and backstab all in the name of capital gain . However , those elements are built into the construct of the game outwit , outplay , outlast . When you sign up to play Survivor , you understand that you ll be lied to at some point . But you do n t expect to have your personal life exposed and used against you in the game . Side Note : Some might question whether host Jeff Probst and the producers are complicit in all this by airing what happened . It s a gray area , and I certainly do n t have the answers . According to Probst in an interview with EW , Zeke was aware someone could figure out he was transgender while on the show and said he would deal with it as it arises . The Reactions Thankfully , Jeff was immediately pounced upon by his tribemates . As he tried to backtrack and protect his image , not wanting to be seen as an evil , hateful person , the tribe let him know how wrong his actions were . Andrea and Tai were both visibly upset and vocal . You f *** ing just outed him ! Nobody has the right to out anybody ! Tai yelled . Jeff , while apologetic , still tried to throw in his excuses , claiming that he assumed everyone in his world knew , which is an absurd assumption to make . Debbie , not often one to talk sense ( OK , there s one Debbie joke ) , made a valid point when she said It was for Zeke to decide when he was comfortable discussing it . Even Ozzy , who can often be aloof , looked at Jeff like a disappointed father , telling him , You should be ashamed of yourself for what you re willing to do to get yourself further in a game for a million dollars . It s like , you re playing with people s lives at this point . And he s right , Jeff went way outside the realm of the game and dragged in something deeply personal . Feeling the heat , Jeff desperately tried to take back what he said . I m not saying that transgender people are deceptive , he pleaded , but Probst was n t about to let him off the hook that easy : You re saying that by not revealing it , [ Zeke s ] capable of deception . That s a giant leap of logic . Do you honestly not see that ? While for the most part , Probst let the tribemates lead the conversation , he would interject every time Jeff tried to steer away from what he did , holding him accountable for his actions . Jeff , you ca n t unring the bell , Probst reminded him . Other than Zeke , who I will definitely get to in just a second , Sarah seemed to be most affected by the whole ordeal . After Andrea and Tai had started to soften somewhat , Sarah refused to let it go , calling what Jeff did a malicious attack . She opened up about her own background , living in a conservative Midwest town where there is n t a lot of diversity . The fact that I can love [ Zeke ] so much , and it does n t change anything for me , makes me realize I ve grown huge as a person , she said through tears . This group of castaways should be commended for their thoughtful and truthful reactions to such a horrid situation . The fact they stood in solidarity against Jeff s actions speaks volumes . But of course , the person who should truly be commended , is Zeke . Zeke the Survivor Player Up until this episode , Survivor never acknowledged Zeke s transgender background , and as far as I m aware , it s not something Zeke had announced publicly . Upon the reveal , Zeke did n t explode in anger or break down in tears he sat in silence , composing himself while everyone else around him dealt with the situation as best they could . And to Probst s credit , he did n t hound Zeke with immediate react questions he let him gather himself before broaching the subject . When Zeke was finally ready to speak , he gave a considered and illuminating answer on why he stopped telling people about being trans . When people know that about you , that s sort of who you are . There are questions people ask . It sort of overwhelms everything else that they know about you , he said . One of the reasons why I did n t want to lead with that is I did n t want to be , like , the trans Survivor player . I wanted to be Zeke the Survivor player . Just as Hatch was never defined solely by his sexuality back in Season 1 , it s clear Zeke never wanted his entire Survivor identity to be that of the trans character . Zeke had every right to tear into Jeff and make him feel as guilty and humiliated as he should have felt but that s not Zeke s style . While he admitted what Jeff did was really not cool ( understatement of the week ) , he hugged Jeff on his way out and told him , It s fine . Despite not wanting to be a role model , Zeke decided to see the good in the situation , recognizing that his story could be inspiring to other trans people watching at home . The class , strength , and forgiveness Zeke showed during this atrocious situation was remarkable . Survivor airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on CBS .",

		"paragraph": "The anchor between Brett Kavanaugh s eyes a deep crease that turned upward at the ends as he got angry this was new . At least to any of us who had yet to see the Supreme Court nominee this mad . But liars often attempt to cloak their deceit and faults with anger and volume . Given Kavanaugh s history of falsehoods , the whole thing was alarming and yet not surprising . Few things are as recognizable as the fury of a privileged man denied . I believe Christine Blasey Ford , so yes , I would argue that Brett Kavanaugh lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his ranting testimony on Thursday , in which he vociferously denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers . He may soon be on the court , however , because he used a brand of masculinity fully endorsed by the Republican Party . The GOP celebrates a manhood of excess , embodied in the president , whom Republicans still fear . Now , that same excess may be calcified for decades in the form of a Justice Kavanaugh . The nominee likely knew he had some ground to make up . Trump was displeased with a Monday interview that Kavanaugh did with Fox News in which he appeared , by the president s estimation , wooden . How someone does on television matters a little too much to Trump , so Thursday s performance was seemingly designed to impress him . Kavanaugh had the act down cold . Petulant and entitled , he took advantage of the leeway that his gender affords him . While Ford painfully adhered to standards of female decorum , perhaps in order to be believed note how often she asked Is this good ? Kavanaugh clearly felt that he had license to misbehave . In lieu of exonerating information , he testified as though his belligerence would ensure that he was believed . Even more than denying the accusations , he openly resented having to endure this national disgrace , as he called it . The Supreme Court nominee began his virtuoso performance of Trumpian machismo with a line that the president must have loved . I wrote it myself yesterday afternoon and evening , Kavanaugh said at the top of his opening remarks . No one has seen a draft of it except for one of my former law clerks , he continued . This is my statement . Kavanaugh chose to wing it on what could have been the most significant day of his career , relying more on arrogance than aptitude . A lack of both preparation and editing are two things that have characterized Trump during his political career . So , too , has his petulance . Men , particularly white and privileged men , find that they can get away with acting like colicky children , and they are infantilized when it suits them . ( Witness how Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner , both adult men , are good kids in Trump s eyes while actual boys like the Central Park Five , whom Trump said should be executed , were suddenly graduated to adulthood . ) Even better for Kavanaugh , the subject of Thursday s hearing was his juvenile behavior . He seemed to take license to behave as he once did in his youth . His testimony was a tantrum . I use words like performance and act because in that environment , behavior is theater . Is Kavanaugh the stilted choirboy who celebrated his adolescent virginity on Fox News ? Or is he the belligerent and condescending prep-school brat ? Is he the guy who , as we ve been told by accusers and former classmates alike , was a sloppy and mean drunk ? After yesterday , I think we know him a little better . This is not to say that he was particularly forthcoming . Kavanaugh hid behind his indignation until he no longer could , when Sen. Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) called his tough-guy bluff . If he was so certain of his innocence , Durbin asked , why not turn to White House counsel Don McGahn and demand that these claims be investigated by federal authorities so that he may be exonerated ? Kavanaugh , for once , was struck dumb . He sat there frozen , the anchor between his eyes disappeared into a shocked visage . Wildly swinging all day , he d been hit by the punch he did n t see coming . There was a litany of other questions that the nominee evaded or refused to answer , but Durbin pinned him so hard to the mat that Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , once thought to be reasonable , tried to shift the momentum with a hysterical tirade . Kavanaugh , a veteran of the George W. Bush administration , exposed himself anew as a naked partisan , railing that the resistance to his nomination was about revenge on behalf of the Clintons . I laughed to keep from crying as I imagined him giving a fair hearing to a case involving Planned Parenthood or any other group associated with the left . In normal political times , such a display would have immediately disqualified Kavanaugh from serving on the Supreme Court . But all of that surely helped him . Trump , having already recognized his bond with Kavanaugh as a fellow accused sexual abuser , had to see some of himself in his nominee s showing . Having watched just about all of the testimony from Air Force One and later in his White House residence , the president s praise was effusive . His testimony was powerful , honest , and riveting , Trump tweeted . Adopting Kavanaugh s own characterization of the allegations , he added that Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay , obstruct , and resist . The Senate must vote ! Despite pleas to the contrary from the American Bar Association and others , Republicans have scheduled a vote to advance Kavanaugh s nomination for Friday afternoon . Even Jeff Flake , the outgoing senator from Arizona who enjoys talking tough about Trump , signaled his support for the nominee . Kavanaugh s presentation embodied the malignant manhood that the Republican Party has embraced under Trump . They excuse the boy that Kavanaugh was so that they can use the man he is now . As the voices of #MeToo rise , these powerful white men somehow feel silenced . Kavanaugh is a retort .",

		"paragraph": "Ocean s 8 stole our hearts with its jazzy first teaser , and a just-released new trailer for the all-female reboot of Steven Soderbergh â€˜ s popular heist franchise , aptly set to the tune of Linda Ronstadt â€˜ s You re No Good , confirms its status as one of 2018 s must-see megahits in the making . But do n t take our word for it . Just ask Soderbergh himself , who told Yahoo Entertainment that the film which opens in theaters on June 8 lives up to the hype and then some . I m really , really happy with the movie , raves the filmmaker , who handed off directorial duties on Ocean s 8 to his friend and collaborator Gary Ross but stayed onboard as a producer . I think it s really smart and really funny , and when you see all of these women together , it s incredibly satisfying . ( Watch the new trailer above . ) Casting was central to the appeal of the original Ocean s movies as well , with Soderbergh bringing together such big-name actors as George Clooney , Brad Pitt , Matt Damon , and Bernie Mac in the same frame . ( The franchise was itself a reimagining of the 1960s Rat Pack assemblage titled Ocean s 11 , led by Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , and Sammy Davis Jr. ) Ocean s 8 repeats that magic by uniting a crew of A-list actresses , whose characters received individual social media introductions this week in advance of the trailer premiere . Overseeing the squad is Debbie ( Sandra Bullock ) , ex-con and sister of master criminal Danny Ocean ( George Clooney ) . To get her hands on a stupidly expensive necklace modeled by world-famous celebrity Daphne Kluger ( Anne Hathaway ) , she recruits the talents of her righthand woman Lou ( Cate Blanchett ) , recently retired criminal Tammy ( Sarah Paulson ) , financially strapped seamstress Rose ( Helena Bonham Carter ) , jewelry maker Amita ( Mindy Kaling ) , pickpocket Constance ( Awkwafina ) and surveillance expert Nine Ball ( Rihanna ) . Their target : the Metropolitan Museum of Art s annual Met Gala . Because this is another example of a female cast inheriting what had previously been a male-dominated franchise , comparisons will obviously be drawn to Paul Feig s updated version of Ghostbusters , a movie that was mercilessly ( and unfairly ) attacked by online trolls in the months leading up to its 2016 release . Flash forward two years , though , and the timing seems ideal for a movie like Ocean s 8 . After all , recent success stories like Wonder Woman and Lady Bird to say nothing of larger social conversations happening around the #TimesUp movement have revealed a deep desire on the part of audiences and critics to see women front and center onscreen . Indeed , since the new trailer dropped , Twitter has been all over Ocean s 8 , praising the film s style and its stylish cast . Soderbergh seems to recognize that he s associated with the right film at the right time . I was talking with Gary and said , â€˜ Wow , we may have gotten really lucky here in terms of the Zeitgeist , ' he says . The pleasure of seeing this particular cast share a frame is going to be amplified by what s going on culturally right now . As to what s going on inside that frame , Soderbergh promises that Debbie Ocean will continue to operate the family business with the same style and verve as her brother , Danny . It s a universe that s defined more by what does n t fit than what does , he explains . So an idea would pop between Gary , [ screenwriter ] Olivia Milch , and myself , and there would be a conversation . â€˜ Is that an Ocean s - y enough idea ? Is it slightly outside the sandbox ? In general , they did a great job of re-creating the spirit of the franchise it feels like an Ocean s movie . At the same time , the New York setting gives Ocean s 8 a unique spirit , distinct from the Las Vegas antics of Ocean s Eleven and Thirteen as well as the European locations seen in Twelve . Soderbergh describes how the production team carefully scouted Manhattan locations , trying to shoot in real places as much as possible . That included the Met itself after some careful negotiation with the museum , they were granted access to the entire building for nine nights after the public left . The way we pitched it to them was , â€˜ Do you know how many people go to the Bellagio in Vegas to see where all those guys stood ? ' Soderbergh says , referring to a memorable scene from the conclusion of Ocean s Eleven . You see this movie , and you re gon na want to go to the Met to see where all these scenes take place . Ocean s 8 hits theaters on June 8 . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : Watch the first Ocean s 8 teaser :",

It will literally kick you out if you use the word literally . Continental bar in Manhattan put a notice on its window banning the word literally . The sign s final sentence urges patrons to Stop Kardashianism now . Sorry but if you say the word â€˜ literally inside Continental you have 5 minutes to finish your drink and then you must leave , the sign reads .

The Continental s owner since 1991 , Trigger Smith , is not unfamiliar with negative publicity . He has a strict dress-code policy that some have called racist for allegedly targeting minorities , a claim Smith refutes . In a lengthy statement on the bar s website in response to these accusations , Smith wrote : Anyone that knows me , my character and values knows that racism is anathema to everything that I stand for . I have fought racism , sexism and any other social injustices and ignorant , malicious behavior my entire life . In a recent interview with Grub Street , Smith admits the policy banning the word literally is tongue-in-cheek , but says he really does hate that word . It s not just millennials .

The team recently set their sights on the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk , and the resulting HPE1200 upgrade package is nothing short of spectacular . Powered by a 6.2-liter V8 engine ( the same one used in the Dodge Challenger Hellcat ) , the base Jeep Trackhawk already boasted an impressive 707 hp and mid-11 second quarter-mile performance . But Hennessey Performance clearly revels in pushing the envelope in terms of how it s possible to extend the original hardware . The design team envisioned a modified HPE1200 engine that consists of upgraded pistons , rods , ported cylinder heads , camshaft upgrade , long tube stainless steel headers , and a 4.5-liter supercharger system . That translates to 1,200 hp and 1,100 ft lbs of torque at the motor and 1,003 hp and 892 ft lbs of torque at the wheels . Our team really enjoys pushing the limits and discovering what s possible with the vehicles we build , says company founder and CEO John Hennessey . Some may say that it s pointless to build an SUV quicker than nearly every supercar and hypercar on the market today . I say that is exactly the point . Thankfully , we have many customers who also share our passion . The jeep can now go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.3 seconds flat on its way to a quarter-mile time of 9.66 seconds at 145 miles per hour . That standout speed makes the Hennessey-tuned jeep the quickest accelerating SUV on the planet . Hennessey contends that the HPE1200 Trackhawk is as fast as a Bugatti Chiron , yet has room for 4 passengers and luggage and when you get right down to it , what more could you ask for ? Only 24 units of the HPE1200 Trackhawk will be produced at a base price of $ 179,000 . Available for export to international markets , the Hennessey Trackhawk can be purchased directly from Hennessey or from select Jeep dealers .

Her boyfriend 's father took a series of shots of the 19-year-old lying on her back before a shark bit Zarutskie 's arm , pulling her underneath the water . Nurse sharks are thought to be largely harmless to humans , yet they will bite defensively if they are bothered by divers ( or in this case Instagram stars ) who assume that they 're docile .

		"paragraph": "New Edition fans , if you re planning on tuning in to BET s three-night miniseries about the R&B group , premiering Jan. 24 , be prepared to see a movie that has a lot more in common with recent musical biographies like Straight Outta Compton and the History of the Eagles documentary . Like those fine flicks , The New Edition Story focuses on the music , and , in this instance , uses it to plot a timeline of the group s history . From their beginnings as preteens in Boston s Orchard Park projects and eventual international success to their turbulent personal histories , music industry trials , and changing lineup thanks to various side projects and solo albums , the miniseries features all six New Edition members as producers leading to an honest , warts-and-all story that holds surprises for even the most devoted fans of Bobby Brown , Ralph Tresvant , Ricky Bell , Michael Bivins , Ronnie DeVoe , and Johnny Gill . Related : Review : â€˜ The New Edition Story is a Music Biopic Done Right The New Edition Story executive producer Jesse Collins , who has produced everything from the Grammys and the Soul Train Awards to the BET Awards and Kevin Hart s BET mockumentary Real Husbands of Hollywood , talked to Yahoo TV about how his long history of working with New Edition led to the ambitious miniseries how producers Babyface and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis helped shape the movie s music focus how the cast ( including Empire â€˜ s Bryshere Gray and Stranger Things â€˜ Caleb McLaughlin ) learned New Edition s songs and meticulously choreographed routines during an intense , month-long boot camp and why the seventh member of the group , a previously unsung hero of the New Edition story , will finally share some of the spotlight in The New Edition Story . Yahoo TV : The miniseries is great , and I think the main reason it s so fun is because there was obviously a decision made to focus on the music . We get performances of entire New Edition songs throughout the three nights . Jesse Collins : Thank you . With the benefit of being able to clear all that music , and with Babyface doing the early songs , and then having Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis come onboard and produce everything that they produced for the actual group , it really made the music stand out . It does n t get much better than that . Related : â€˜ The New Edition Story : Where You ve Seen The Cast Before How difficult was it to clear all of that ? I think we got very lucky . New Edition has a lot of love and respect around the industry , and there are people at Universal , where their catalog sits , that were at Universal and MCA when they were signed to the label 20 years ago . People like Jeff Harleston , who were there during their run , did everything they could to make sure that we got that music . The same thing goes for Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , who did the Heart Break album and Home Again album . When we had our conversations about it , they were like , We ll do whatever we can to make this work and make this right , because these guys deserve it . It makes it much easier , because your conversation is , Babyface wants to do this , or , Jimmy and Terry want to do this , and people say , OK . And it s New Edition . The waters start to part . What sparked the idea to do the miniseries ? That started about 10 years ago . I [ produced ] a show for BET , for [ the network s ] 25th anniversary . At the time , I had dealt with New Edition a lot in a lot of different scenarios . But in producing that show , it was the first time I had ever dealt with them where there was n t a buffer in the sense that there was n t a label person and there was n t a manager . I was dealing with them directly . It was the first time that I got to really see how that group functioned or does n t function . I got to see the function and the dysfunction all in one . It was not the way I thought that group operated , and the roles that each one of them has in the group are not what I had thought . When we got through with that show , I called Mike Bivins at , like , six in the morning , and I was like , Nobody would believe that this is the relationship . We should really tell this story , because it wo n t be what people expect . I think people have a really specific idea of what they think the New Edition story is , and they believe that all the crazy stuff was because of Bobby and he s the only one that went through problems . It s just not true . You see all that in the film . Anyway , long story short , they were willing to start the conversation to tell the story and really pull back the curtain and show who they are . That s another aspect of the miniseries that is so compelling it does n t seem like anything was sugarcoated . All six group members are producers on the project , so obviously , it s authorized . But was there any hesitancy at any point by the guys ? The development process was , Abdul Williams , who s an amazing writer , went and sat with each member individually and basically got them to tell the story of New Edition from their perspective . Then , we put all six perspectives together , and that was the basis of the movie . It was interesting , because when they first read the script , for them , they were learning about things , kind of like the audience will . Two people can have the same experience , but it affects them in two completely different ways . These guys did n t communicate how they felt about certain things ever , so a lot of things came out , a lot of warts came out , when they read this script . Then , that was the moment of truth , of , OK , are you guys going to move forward with this story now that you kind of see what happened ? They said , Yes , let s do it . Let s just tell the story . There s that great scene in the miniseries at Ronnie s wedding where Ralph and Mike have a very honest conversation . Was that an example of one of those moments you re talking about ? Ralph and Mike , yeah â€¦ they have pieced together their relationship , so basically , that was a combination of a couple of conversations that they ve had to just come to an understanding of how they each felt when Ralph went solo , which was kind of like a big line was drawn in their relationship in that moment . It took them a long time to get to a place to admit how they were feeling and why they acted the way they did . I think that s the only reason that they re able to stand next to each other today . You said you were surprised when you worked directly with them and found out how their relationships really worked . What was the biggest surprise for you ? What was the thing that most sparked you to want to tell their story ? First of all , I did n t realize Ronnie DeVoe s role in the group , in the dynamic of the group . I did n t realize the power that Ronnie has in that group . Then , when I found out all of the things that Ricky went through and his role in the group , it really kind of made me think â€¦ We knew that Bobby s an attractive character . We knew Ralph is an attractive character . You knew Mike Bivins was an attractive character . I think when I found out Johnny , Ronnie , and Ricky s roles in the group and their dynamics in the relationship between the six as a collective , that s when I really felt like , OK , now we really have a movie . I consider myself definitely a fan and somebody who knows as much about them as anybody else , but I did n t know any of that . That made me think , We definitely have a movie , because when we get into those parts , people will really be blown away . All the cast members have talked about a boot camp they attended before filming , to learn all the songs and dances for New Edition s music . It sounds grueling . Were you there , too ? I was there every day . We called it the Bunker . We got this office with no windows in Tarzana . They were in the warehouse part of the Bunker , and it was just really uncomfortable . That s where they rehearsed all day . It was rough on them , but the purpose of it was also to make them become a group , make them become a unit without having to say , You guys need to become best friends . But that s what happened . Before we went into production , I ran into [ director ] Gary Gray , and we talked about Straight Outta Compton , and he said that he did things in the development of that movie . He would call a meeting with the cast , and then he would n t show up or he d show up four hours late to make them get to know each other and bond and just become a group . I called [ New Edition Story director ] Chris Robinson , and I was like , We have to make these guys miserable . We ve got to put them all together , and they can hate us , but they ve got to become best friends , so we ve got to figure that out . That s what Gary did with Straight Outta Compton , and we want to be on that level . A bit of the boot camp footage is on the BET website , and it s fun to see the kid actors , the adult actors , and the actual group members together . Will you include that boot camp footage on a DVD release , or maybe air it on BET eventually ? It s incredible footage , and I hope that BET does put it all out . You get to see all the guys . Mike working with Bryshere [ who plays adult Bivins ] â€¦ Brooke Payne taught them all the choreography , the guy who created it all and has been not just their manager , but really like a father to all of them . He kind of became a father to our cast , too . He s working with them and teaching them the choreography , but then to have the real guys come in and say , Yes , that is the choreography , but this is the way I twist my hand . This is the way I snap my fingers . This is how I roll my shoulder â€¦ It s all of those little , subtle details that the cast got from the group members , and that is what really makes that choreography hold up . You just mentioned Brooke Payne . As you said , he named the group , he managed them , he is the choreographer , and his priority was always what was best for them , which was definitely not true of all their adult business colleagues . He is incredibly important in their history , but probably a lot , maybe even most , fans have no idea about all that . Look , I do n t think there s a New Edition without Brooke Payne . He is the seventh member . He has been with them through everything . He s taken a lot of falls , and he s still stuck with those guys . He held true to his promise , which was to teach them to be professionals . It was never about the star thing with him . He was just going to teach them to be the best men that they can be , and that s really what he accomplished . I think it s because of him , why they still come back together , because he taught them they re strongest when they re the six . The brotherhood is above everything . The cast had to learn all these songs and dance routines , and they recorded all the songs we hear in the miniseries . The scope of the project is impressive . Did it feel like you were producing a movie , a concert tour , and an album all at once ? We were just really trying to fit everything in . Chris and I and Valerie Sharp , who is a co-producer on the film and handled the production , really helped us try to accomplish everything . We re spanning a huge amount of time , and you re seeing New Edition s growth not only as people , you re seeing them go from kids to adults , but you see them start out performing with no production . Then , they get a [ stage backdrop ] . Then , they re performing in arenas . We really tried to show their growth , which meant that that s a lot of different platforms . It s music videos , it s album covers . We tried to get everything in there . Basically , in the opening sequence , I do n t know if you noticed , but it goes from vinyl to tape to CD . We take you through the music , in the order the music was released in . That kind of takes you through the timeline of the film . You end the movie with a re-creation of New Edition s mini-concert-length performance from the BET 25th anniversary special . Given that that s where the idea for the movie sparked for you , was that important to you to end it there ? We decided to end it there because New Edition , to this day , they re still out there performing . They re still great performers . They re the strongest when they re onstage . It s kind of a theme in the film , an underlying theme , that there can be chaos backstage , but when it s time to line up , it s time to line up . They deliver on that . To end on that big performance , we were trying to , in 11 minutes or however long it is , take you back through the film , and take you through all of the records that you love , and kind of remind you of the journey that these guys have traveled so that they can all stand there , the six of them , together . It was more about a concert that really happened that had the six there , and the six of them standing in a triumphant point of view . One of the first things I did after watching the miniseries was fill in any music my collection was missing from New Edition , Bell Biv DeVoe , and the group members solo albums . Do you expect they ll see a boost in record sales and concert ticket sales after the movie ? I think so . I hope so . I hope the fans buy the music again . From [ fan ] screenings , I m seeing more and more kids at these screenings , and they love the music , so I think they may get new fans , kids that love the music . I remember when I was a kid , La Bamba came out , and I remember that became the only song we were listening to all day . New Edition s music is timeless . It s so infectious , still great pop , R&B music . Oh , yeah . Candy Girl , Can You Stand the Rain , If It Is n t Love , they re just fun . They re fun records . If you listen to what Bruno Mars is doing right now , that sound is coming back . The New Edition Story airs Jan. 24 , 25 , and 26 at 9 p.m. on BET .",

		"paragraph": "The Brooklyn Nets have signed Houston Rockets restricted free-agent forward Donatas Motiejunas to a four-year and likely $ 35 million offer sheet , league sources told The Vertical . The terms of the offer sheet are rife with protections against recurring back problems that have sidelined Motiejunas and could make it even more palatable for the Rockets to match and retain the 7-footer . The contract delivers the ability to void the final two years of the contract , as well as an opportunity to bail on the second season before the end of the 2016-17 season , league sources told The Vertical . The offer sheet has Motiejunas earning $ 5 million upon the signing of the contract , and the team has to decide by Jan. 10 whether to pay him another $ 3.5 million for the remainder of the 2016-17 season , league sources said . By March 1 , the team has to pick up the option for $ 9 million owed to Motiejunas for the 2017-18 season , sources said . The final two years of the contract are non-guaranteed , league sources said , which means the team can cut Motiejunas loose without paying the balance of the contract . Before the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons , there s a July 7 trigger date to make a decision on Motiejunas deal . Each of the four years includes $ 1 million in likely bonuses , and $ 500,000 in unlikely bonuses , sources said . The Nets delivered the offer sheet electronically to the Rockets on Friday night , and Houston has until midnight Tuesday to match the offer sheet and retain Motiejunas . Concerns over recurring back issues which included surgery to repair a ruptured disk in 2015 impacted the interest NBA teams had in signing Motiejunas , 26 , to an offer sheet over the summer . If acquired , Nets general manager Sean Marks and coach Kenny Atkinson view Motiejunas as a power forward playing beside center Brook Lopez . Houston had been offering a deal in the $ 8 million range annually , but talks had been sparse between the sides for months . Motiejunas , who played 37 games a year ago following surgery , and the Rockets had been unable to come to terms on an agreement , causing the 7-footer to miss training camp and Houston s 12-7 start to the regular season . Coach Mike D Antoni has been eager to incorporate Motiejunas into the Rockets frontcourt and join the current No. 4 seed in the Western Conference . The uncertainty around Houston s willingness to agree to a long-term deal with Motiejunas was because of his back issues . Motiejunas was examined by Nets doctors recently , league sources said , and the results gave comfort to Brooklyn to move forward with the offer sheet . For the Nets , this is the third restricted free agent offer sheet executed under Marks . July offer sheets to Portland guard Allen Crabbe ( four years , $ 75 million ) and Miami guard Tyler Johnson ( four years , $ 50 million ) were matched . With a franchise devoid of draft picks and talent , Marks has been determined to find creative ways to improve the Nets roster . Taking a shot at Motiejunas is a pre-emptive move on next summer s free agent market . The Rockets had a three-way trade that would ve sent Motiejunas to Detroit voided last season . The Pistons doctors failed Motiejunas on his physical exam because of the back . More NBA coverage from The Vertical :",

		"paragraph": "Whether or not Ben Affleck remains the Dark Knight could ultimately come down to the cost of insurance . Affleck , a recovering alcoholic who is currently in rehab for the second time in less than a year , could be too expensive of a liability for Warner Bros , according to a new report from TheWrap . Industry insiders told TheWrap that insurers for forthcoming projects starring Affleck will want a substantial amount of the film s budget set aside in escrow as a deductible . More than likely the studio will replace him because the insurance costs are going to go through the roof , a representative for a completion bond company told TheWrap . He would be bondable , but the deductible would be really high , probably the budget of the film . As such , the cost to insure the forthcoming Justice League sequel could exceed $ 150 million on a budget of $ 300 million . Publicly , Warner Bros. has expressed a desire to stick with Affleck , saying in a statement last year : Ben is our Batman . We love him as Batman . We want to keep him in the cowl as long as we can . However , behind the scenes studio executives have reportedly pondered an exit strategy . Already Affleck stepped down as the writer and director of a standalone Batman film . His replacement , Matt Reeves , is hoping to begin production on the project early next year , but has thus far remained coy about Affleck s involvement . However , previous reports suggested Reeves was eyeing a younger actor to play the Cape Crusader . As of now , Affleck is still attached to star in the upcoming Justice League sequel , and has called himself the luckiest guy in the world for having the opportunity to play the coolest part in the universe . How long that opportunity lasts not only depends on Affleck s own recovery , but whether Warner Bros. believes his involvement is worthy of the exuberant price tag . We ll keep you updated .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This postmortem contains spoilers for the Useful Occupations And Deceptions episode of Outlander . When sparks stop flying in the Fraser bedroom , even when a freshly waxed honeypot is involved , you know something is definitely rotten in the state of France . Season 2 started smack dab in the middle of Jamie s shame spiral over being raped and tortured by Black Jack , and thanks to all the political maneuvering , manipulating , and general misogyny of the 18th century and Parisian high society , the rift between the Scot and the sassenach continued to grow in the latest episode of Outlander . Jamie is not in a healthy place when they begin this part of their journey , says Sam Heughan . And France and the mission they are on there trying to infiltrate the Jacobite rebellion and stop the battle of Culloden and a race of people being wiped out has a lot of consequences on their relationship , and love may not be strong enough to see them through . They re not comfortable in this world . Caitriona Balfe ( Claire ) admits that she experienced an adjustment period when they started filming season 2 . Even though we were playing the same characters , it felt almost like a different show . Our characters , in a sense , were also playing characters as well . We re so used to Jamie and Claire being so honorable , honest and forthright . And here , we find them in a situation where they re being quite duplicitous and manipulative . It was an uncomfortable readjustment for us , but they were also feeling that , so it helped us [ as actors ] too . They re people dealing with very personal journeys alongside the shared mission , Balfe continues . Privately , they re both struggling . Together they ve found this common language of this mission , this goal . But it s not exactly healthy ground for them and it really puts a lot of strain on their marriage . But that s what happens in a marriage people have work stresses and evolve at different times and deal with things and we always said the series is the story of how a marriage stays together . It s that constant elasticity that you need to have as a couple . It s so intriguing to explore . Jamie is most certainly battling post-traumatic stress disorder and the lingering effects of what happened at Wentworth at the end of season 1 causes him to retreat inward . Heughan explains , You re so used to Jamie opening up to Claire and telling [ her ] exactly how he feels . Season 2 he s doing the exact opposite of that . He s doing this mission all day and getting drunk all night . He does n t talk about what has happened to him . We miss them connecting , which then pulls them apart , and we re missing that intimacy between them . Ultimately that comes to a head because they re not dealing with those issues . Just like in real life , communication is key to a solid standing , according to Balfe . As with any relationship , lack of communication is never a good sign or a good thing . It drives a wedge between them . I think they re going on very private journeys in the beginning of this season . For Claire , it s quite a lonely time . Claire has also , at least for the time being , decided to keep the possibly explosive news that Black Jack is alive to herself . When she finds out about Black Jack , her biggest fear is that this will send Jamie into a spiral again or make him do something rash . Maybe he ll try and go back to Scotland and kill Black Jack , explains the actress . So there s a lot of fear in her decision to not tell him . She feels a lot of guilt about it . It continues this sort of alienation that the two have from each other . Related : â€˜ Outlander Stars Play â€˜ Outlander or Outlandish ? The disconnect is not helped by the sneaky plan they ve concocted to change her history/his future either . Jamie s forthright , honorable , and speaks his mind so to be deceptive , manipulative , and to lie is not in his character so the way he acts really does n t sit well with either of them , Heughan says . As the season progresses , the pressure on Jamie grows and they do things they do n t want to do and there s betrayal . Just being in Paris is killing their relationship . It forces them into addressing that later on . It also clearly does n t help that they have become two ships passing in the night with Jamie spending all hours in a brothel and at court playing chess and Claire being relegated to looking pretty , being waited on hand and foot , and having frivolous conversations about slang terms for man bits or lady-scaping . He knows what needs to be done . Obviously , he s the one that has to do it because he s a man and can maneuver in the French court , Heughan says . Claire , even though she knows what needs doing , ca n t do more than play the woman s role and that does n t sit well for her . She is not one to sit around and gossip in the lady s drawing room . Claire does not take the conventional corner she is being pushed into well . The feeling is summed up so deliciously in the scene with Master Raymond in which she says , I am an unusual lady . At least I used to be . Ever since I came to Paris , my life has gotten more and more conventional by the day as I suppose have I. Balfe adores that scene . It s a great moment , and Master Raymond is a kindred spirit . Claire had more freedom in Scotland . She was an outsider , yes , and that came with dangers , but she did n t have to live by the rules of Scottish society . She s under more constraints here . Women are supposed to be pretty ornaments relegated to the drawing rooms , drinking tea , and gossiping . She feels frustrated and handicapped because she s unable to [ enjoy ] her outlets for creativity and her calling for healing . So naturally Claire is thrilled to find an outlet at the hospital . She finds her purpose again , says Balfe . She begins to feel useful and like a vital human being again . Unfortunately , as we saw in the episode , her new gig tasting urine and lancing boils and the time it takes her away from the home frustrates Jamie and pushes them even farther apart . Jamie sees that as sort of a betrayal because he believes he s out working on the mission , and she s just going off to sort of almost enjoy herself , Heughan says . I guess if he was to sit down and think about it for a while , he would realize that she needs that . But it s tough , this world , and it s not conducive for a good relationship . But never fear , Outfanders : Heughan promises that there is light at the end of the Chunnel . Spoiler alert : The catalyst to the recovery of their relationship is coming . All this drama and tragedy them brings them closer together again , and [ someone ] turning up fires off all these things and It makes them stronger . Outlander airs Saturdays at 9 p.m. on Starz .",

The former Real Housewives of New Jersey star is currently servicing a 41-month prison sentence for mail , wire and bankruptcy fraud that began in March 2016 . James J.

The newlywed duchess stepped out in yet another creation by Givenchy s Clare Waight Keller who designed her royal wedding dress as she joined Queen Elizabeth II for a joint appearance in Cheshire , England . Having gotten criticism for showing off her shoulders at last weekend s Trooping the Colour celebration , Meghan played it safe but oh-so chic in a high-necked , off-white sheath featuring a capelet-style top that kept her upper arms under wraps . Black accessories heels , a clutch , and a slim belt completed the ensemble . The queen , meanwhile , stayed true to her habit of wearing bold , eye-catching colors . Her acid-green coat , worn over a floral dress , is by Stewart Parvin , with a matching hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan .

And while we all may have been swooning over the iconic duo s first official outing alone , people online could n t help but notice a similarity between 36-year-old Meghan Markle s outfit and the Wimbledon umpire ensembles . The Duchess of Sussex looked stunning in a $ 795 pinstriped Ralph Lauren polo shirt , which she matched with a pair of $ 2,277 white , silk wide-leg Ralph Lauren pants . However , when you look at the umpires , they seem to be wearing near-identical outfits , in the form of a blue and white pinstriped shirt and white pants . It is entirely possible that Meghan was totally aware of this fact , especially considering the official umpire outfits are actually designed by Ralph Lauren . Just a quick look at the designer s page will bring you to a whole Wimbledon-inspire collection . A very similar Ralph Lauren shirt can actually be bought on the Wimbledon official online shop page , costing just $ 114 . The Duchess paired her look with a $ 900 ivory straw hat by Maison Michel , a Altuzarra mini bag and a pair of Sarah Flint heels . Meanwhile Kate Middleton showed how different their styles are by wearing a white and navy Jenny Packham dress . However she did take style tips from her new sister-in-law , by carrying a Dolce and Gabbana satchel bag , which she usually shuns in favour of a clutch bag . Got a story tip ?

		"paragraph": "Spoiler alert ! If you have n t watched Justified s satisfying series finale The Promise , written by Graham Yost , Fred Golan , Dave Andron , and Benjamin Cavell , and directed by Adam Arkin stop reading now . As he s done throughout the final season , showrunner Yost takes Yahoo TV inside the writers room to dissect key scenes . Related : â€˜ Justified Series Finale : Showdown and Shoot - 'Em - Up Boyd lives ! Did you ever think about going the other way?Oh , yeah . We thought about it , but as much as it was about Boyd , it really came down to Raylan . If Raylan was to shoot Boyd , then what does that say about Raylan ? Has he grown at all over the course of this series ? Tim [ Olyphant ] and I , right from the beginning , felt that Raylan should grow just a little bit and I m making a gesture with my hand where my thumb and my forefinger are about a half an inch apart . In Elmore Leonard s world , characters tend to talk about changing , but they keep on doing the same things . But there s usually one character who nudges forward a little , and we felt that would be Raylan s story . So we needed him to not kill Boyd and show that little bit of growth . He went from angry to stubborn , as he says to Winona in the end.From angry to stubborn . As a fan , you expect yourself to be sad that Boyd ends up in prison , and yet , it s nice to see him with a flock again when we flash-forward four years . He s got a captive audience . [ Laughs . ] It was just such a collaborative thing in the final run . Talking to Walton [ Goggins ] about it , he said , What if I m preaching again ? And then when I told Tim that idea , he said something to the effect of , Raylan should say , â€˜ You know you re repeating yourself , right ? It s part of the circular motion that we were aiming for in the final season , bringing things back around . Raylan has taken Boyd down once again , and Boyd has now found the lord once again , and it s just that cycle continued . Their final conversation in the prison will move some fans to tears . First of all , Boyd telling Raylan that he knows he never believed a word coming out of his mouth but he hopes he enjoyed it that s from Elmore.Yes . Very good . That s what Elmore said about Boyd to Walton [ I do n t believe a goddamn thing you say , but I sure do enjoy watching you say it ] . Does Raylan really believe Boyd loved Ava?I could n t say for sure â€¦ I would say Raylan would be willing to grant that Boyd believes he did , but he s really using him . It s interesting . If you deconstruct that scene , the whole reason Raylan is there is to lie to Boyd . He s lying to this guy that he s known for half his life or more all his life , essentially . He s there to lie to him and tell him that Ava s dead , and he has to convince him that he s telling him the truth , and so , to a certain degree , everything Raylan says in that scene is a manipulation of Boyd , and yet , I think that he s also sincere . So he s lying , and he s sincere , and that s really what we were going for . Related : ' Justified Series Finale : Joelle Carter s Instagram Takeover There s that moment in the pilot when Boyd and Raylan first reunite where Boyd tells him that Dewey Crowe said he had to run Raylan off at Ava s . Raylan says , You believe that ? And Boyd says , Not if you say it ai n t so . Boyd believes Raylan . Raylan does n t lie to Boyd , and so that s what Raylan uses . [ Laughs . ] So basically our hero turns out to be a liar . No , no , no . It s for a good reason . Right , because Ava does n t want Boyd to ever know that she had his son . I also forgot until I rewatched the pilot that when Ava and Raylan first reunite , as she tells him about killing abusive Bowman , she says Bowman had blamed her for having a miscarriage after he beat her with a belt and for not giving him a son to go hunting with him and Boyd.Guess what ? I forgot that , too . None of us had gone back and re-screened the pilot . We just thought we knew it . We should ve asked VJ [ Boyd ] because , as StoryTron in the room , he was always very good at remembering all the details . But that never came up . I thought maybe that s why she wanted to get away from Boyd so badly . Well , listen , I think she wanted to get away so badly anyway . The question we had in the room is : Did she know she was pregnant when she ran , or was that something she discovered a month into her fleeing ? And we did n t land on it . We really thought more that she probably did n t know , but maybe on an unconscious level her body knew , and her body was telling her mind , and that was affecting her decision . We just like the notion of these lives going on and the generation to come , and what do you owe that generation ? And the idea of her trying to keep her son out of the web that she got caught in , we thought , was a pretty strong motivation that Raylan would instantly identify with that , having been a child of that world himself , and it was hard for him to get out . I think that as much as he did n t take Ava in for Ava s sake , I think he was really doing it for the kid . Her son , Zachariah , is buttoned-up just like Boyd . [ Laughs . ] That was just our little joke , and everyone gave me such crap for it , but I mean , it may be just sort of a genetic thing that he said , No , mommy , to the top . I do n t know . We thought of having little tattoos on his fingers , just maybe Barney or a Teletubby or something . At the end of the prison scene , Raylan and Boyd s final exchange is perfect : Boyd wants to know why Raylan has come to deliver the news about Ava in person , and Raylan says if he allows himself to be sentimental , there is one thing he comes back to : We dug coal together , Boyd says . And Raylan gets the last line : That s right . That felt like the truth : You go back to the pilot , and after Raylan shot Boyd in Ava s kitchen , Raylan said , I m sorry , but you called it , and he flashed back to running out of a mine with Boyd . Ava asked him why he said he was sorry : Boyd and I dug coal together . Well , as I said , I think he is lying to Boyd and he s genuine . It was Walton s idea to put the We dug coal together line in it , and as soon as he said it , it just felt right . And it was interesting to have him say it this time as opposed to Raylan . Let s go back to the beginning of the finale : Markham ( Sam Elliott ) is pressuring Ava for the rest of his money , and just the way he pulled her chair closer to him â€¦ That was Sam . They re rehearsing the scene , sitting there . How about if I do this ? And he just grabbed the chair and pulled it in . I went up to Adam Arkin and said , You know , we should have a side angle so we can really get that sense of her being pulled in , and he looked at me like , Yeah , I know . Of course we re going to do that . But that is one of my favorite shots in the whole finale , him dragging her closer . Ava tries to call Zachariah , but Boyd answers and agrees to come for the money s sake . You d told us dynamite would come back into play . Boyd used it to keep the marshals at bay , but you just wanted to see him blow stuff up one more time?When we talked to Charlie Almanza [ the show s technical advisor ] , Charlie said , Yeah , if someone started throwing dynamite , you pull back , and you try to create a perimeter . So it actually became almost logical that Boyd could get out of it [ and that Art would leave Raylan on his own ] . And it s logical that Grubes had a phone in his cabin?You know what ? We were talking about that . We found out that there are landlines up in the hills . So there , smartypants . Boyd ultimately shot Markham , including one bullet through the eye . Why the eye?Dave chose the eye , and our brilliant makeup team decided , well , we can put it just below the eye , so that we did n t have to put latex over his eye and an application on top of that . It was really creepy on the set when Sam was walking around with that . Like , Yeah , OK , I ca n t look at you right now , Sam . And one little inside story on that : He actually recorded a line that Dave had written where , as he s dying , he says , There is no light . It was a beautiful line , and it actually played quite well , but then when we were watching the cut , you just felt like with a bullet hole in that position , there s nothing more that you d be able to say . On the page and in the shooting , it was really cool , but in the cut , it just felt like it was a little too much . It s almost the opposite of Mags s death [ Put an end to my troubles . Get to see my boys again . Get to know the mystery . ] She was going into the light , in a way . Yeah . Boyd pulled the trigger on Ava but he was out of bullets . Did he really want to kill her Or â€¦ Did he count the bullets?We do n t know . My feeling is that he counted the bullets and that he was just tormenting her . He wanted to kill her but could n t because it s Ava and he still loved her , but he wanted her to feel like she was going to die . When Raylan showed up at the drying shed , we got the standoff we ve been waiting for : Hearing Boyd was out of bullets , Raylan kicked him another gun.We debated for a long time where the gun came from . I mean , our logic finally landed on the idea of it being Birch , played by Otto Krause , who s our stand-in who got that job we told that story before . Really , Boyd would ve taken his gun from him [ when he walked Birch into the shed ] , but I think in one of the shots , you can see that he s still got his gun in his holster . So we re going to believe that at some point in the melee , he tried to get his gun out , and it hit the floor . But the other thing is , it s Justified , and there are probably guns under every chair in our world . Boyd refused to pull on Raylan , but he wanted Raylan to pull on him . Did he want to take Raylan down with him?I mean , does he really want Raylan to do it , or does he just want to put it all on Raylan ? I think Boyd s point of view is somewhat suicidal , at that point . All is lost : He did n t get Ava . He does n t get the money . Life as he knows it is about to end . He does n t get to go out in a blaze of glory . I mean , he could if he wanted if he wants to pull on Raylan , he can go out in a blaze of glory . But it s not the way Boyd wanted to do it , which would be running down the street and hiding behind cars and taking on an army . So he does n t get to live out the Ballad of Boyd Crowder and go out as an outlaw . At the end of this rope , he s just throwing it back at Raylan s feet . OK , this is up to you . What s it going to be ? Raylan is transporting Ava when Boon ( Jonathan Tucker ) , with Loretta in tow , stops him for their much-anticipated shootout . That location was gorgeous.Just stunning . They picked another location on that road , and then it turned out something was n t permitted or someone else was there there was some complication and one of the location people said , There is this reservoir down at the bottom of the hill . Why do n t we go look at that ? And I went down , and Adam saw it and said , Oh , this is perfect . There s a fence that goes along the road , but just at the area where we shot it , the fence actually drops down out of sight . So you get this clear view of the reservoir the water and the hills behind and it was just a matter of picking the perfect time of day , so the sun s going down . That whole sequence was shot over a Saturday and a Sunday because we get two hours of the perfect light . We got as much as we could and then came back the next day to clean it up . Related : Watch the ' Justified Cast and Showrunner Reminisce at Paley Panel I heard Tim Olyphant say last year that he s occasionally thought Raylan s Stetson , which Elmore was n t initially a fan of , would get shot before Raylan would , and he d have to find himself a new hat . That s essentially what happened.It s just these tremendous writers , all of us working together . In [ episode ] 612 , VJ or Chris [ Provenzano ] put it in the Boon/Loretta/Derek showdown scene , the idea that Boon always goes for the head shot because people might be wearing a vest . So that was a little bit of setup . That was one writer looking out for another writer . And yeah , Tim had wanted the new hat . So if you remember on the Paley Center panel [ last week ] , which you moderated , you d asked what people took from set , and Tim said he had something made and then he took it home , and he would n t say anything more about it that was the hat . Tim had that hat made , and Jonathan [ Tucker ] got to wear it for a couple weeks [ as Boon ] , and then Tim grabbed it from him and said , It s mine because I made it . It s more like the hat Elmore envisioned?It s closer . I ve said this before , because Elmore used to say it : The hat he had in mind was what the troopers who were escorting Lee Harvey Oswald were wearing before Jack Ruby shot him . This is a much hipper hat . Raylan falls , and you know he s not dead if only because there s so much of the finale still to go . But were you hoping to make people a bit nervous ? He stays down a while.I would say that when we watched this with the people in Harlan [ last weekend ] , the most gratifying things were the responses to [ that scene ] because they did n t know what was going to happen . There was laughing when Ava and Loretta dropped down out of sight in their vehicles because the guns were about to go off . There was shock that Raylan falls down and Boon does , too , but their eyes were on Raylan . And Tim did that without a mat . It s hard to do that and not hurt yourself , and he just did it . It looked great , and then Loretta stepping on Boon s arm [ so he could n t fire again at Raylan before dying ] , that got a good response . We were very happy about that , but yeah , there was just that moment : Wait a second ? Have they killed Raylan ? And you know that we have n t . But what if they did ? And that was the goal . Let s talk about Raylan s exit from the Lexington office . He gives Gutterson his copy of The Friends of Eddie Coyle . Why is that significant?Someone commented on the fact that we actually referred to Eddie Coyle at the end of Season 4 , when those thugs are in the nursery with Winona and Raylan , and the scam that they re actually pulling which is they re going to hold Winona while Raylan goes off and kills Drew Thompson that s from Eddie Coyle . The Friends of Eddie Coyle was a seminal book in Elmore Leonard s life . If you see the speech that he made when he accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Book Awards , he talks about The Friends of Eddie Coyle . The first line [ of the book ] is something like , [ Jackie Brown at 26 , with no expression on his face , said that he could get some guns ] and that s where Quentin [ Tarantino ] got the name Jackie Brown , which was not the name of the character originally in Rum Punch . So there is all this circularity in it . But Elmore remembered picking that book up in a bookstore and just reading the first few pages , and it changed his life , and that s the thing that made him make the full switch from Western to crime fiction . So we could n t have Raylan reading an Elmore Leonard book then the universe would ve folded in on itself , and we would ve all been winked out of existence but The Friends of Eddie Coyle seemed right . You mentioned at the Paley panel that you sobbed on set . Was it this goodbye scene?It was the marshals office , yeah . And Nick [ Searcy ] lost it , and Erica [ Tazel ] , and Tim . Here I go again . Thanks . That moment between Raylan and Art does sneak up on you . You can almost see it sneaking up on Tim in the scene.Yeah , and [ Steve ] Porcaro s music was just fantastic under that . That was a beautiful moment as they re having a drink . We wanted to have this moment between them and then just have Nelson walk in . And it was Tim and Nick who said , How about he comes in and breaks the moment , and then we just clink glasses and chug it ? Oh , and the other thing is , when Rachel and Raylan have their little goodbye moment in the office , she says , Nice hat , and he says , I tried it on and it fit that s a callback to the second episode [ of the series ] when she asks him about the cowboy hat . When you flash-forward four years , we learn Raylan is in Miami with Winona and Willa but Winona is now with a man named Richard , played by Jason Gedrick . You got in one last Boomtown alum.We got most of everyone we could from Boomtown and Deadwood , and I got one guy in from Hey Dude , Dave Brisbin [ who played the jewelry store owner earlier this season ] . If the series had gone any longer , we would ve had to go after Full House [ which Yost was a writer on for a short time before he sold the screenplay for Speed ] . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Talks That Moonlit Showdown in ' Collateral , Constable Bob s Return It seems like Raylan and Winona still have a good relationship , which is good . But what happened between them?Well , first of all , in terms of the scene , I would say big credit goes to [ executive producer ] Sarah Timberman . Initially , it was going to be two scenes , one at the playground , and then Raylan was going to take Willa home and we were going to see , Oh my God , it s not his home , and there s this Richard guy ! It was going to take a lot of time , and we needed to get Tim off the set so he could get on a plane overnight to Germany and go be in Oliver Stone s new film about Edward Snowden . And Sarah said , Well , wait a second . What if the whole scene takes place at the playground ? And we have a moment where Raylan and Winona are together , so the audience thinks everything worked out , everything s great , and then have the turn when Willa says , â€˜ Can daddy come for dinner ? and then have Richard walk up . So it was a great idea , and actually , Sarah wrote a bunch of the lines in that scene , but she is not getting any credit on the episode , so hell with her . [ Laughs . ] But yeah , it was just our feeling that Raylan does n t win everything . He stays alive , he gets the bad guy , and he s ultimately going to do a big heroic thing , as it turns out , for Ava but he does n t win on everything . It just felt like the history of Raylan and Winona they re never going to make it work , and yet they re always going to be in love with each other and they re always going to be drawn to each other . When [ executive producer Fred Golan ] saw the scene , he said , Yeah , I still think they re going to end up together at least one more time and then break up and do it again . Well , the way Raylan looks at Winona as she walks away , it s clear he loves her . Again , you d expect that you d be sad , but feeling that lingering chance for them , the disappointment is tempered.Oh , God , yes . He ll always love her . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Breaks Down that Epic Brawl in ' Fugitive Number One Speaking of not changing , Raylan is still a marshal in Miami.A few quick things there : One is it was a joy to get David Koechner back [ as Florida-based Greg Sutter , from the Season 5 premiere ] . He cracked jokes all day , and that was a tough day because that was Tim s last day . We could n t get Matt Craven [ who played the boss who sent Raylan back to Kentucky in the pilot ] . He was out of town . But it worked out right , because we had a limited amount of time , and if Matt had been there , we would ve had to go into his office and do a short little scene there and come out , and it just would ve been really tough . This way , his office was set up , and his name plaque was there , Chief Deputy Dan Grant , but we had Koechner . When Koechner throws the ball and says , Right , Charlie , that s Charlie Almanza . We knew we wanted to get him on camera one time . And when Raylan opens up the envelope and you see the [ newspaper ] picture of Ava in the pumpkin patch , up in the corner of the envelope , it says that it s from the Seattle office of the Marshal Service , and up above that , it says Rachel Brooks . Is Rachel the chief in Seattle?She s either the chief , or , it s only four years later , maybe she s not the chief , but it s a big office , and it s good experience for her . We can assume Art is retired by this point . Where is Gutterson?I think he s in a band that s playing at Coachella this weekend . No . I do n t know . You never know with Gutterson .

Listen , I think cradling Mike in his arms as Mike died in [ episode ] 611 was a wonderful , beautiful moment for Duffy . Of course , his mind immediately goes to dear dead Katherine s tennis bracelet and ring because he is Duffy . The idea [ of him being the one Ava called for help ] , of course he s going to get millions of dollars to do it . It just felt like that was Duffy Duffy manages somehow to survive . How did you decide Ava would end up on a ranch in California , and open her front door to Raylan just like she did in the pilot?We wanted to shoot something that looked like California , and we had a horrendous time finding a place that would work for us . One of the locations people was in the bar that Raylan and Art go into to see the corrupt [ cop ] , and that bar was up in Frazier Park . And as she was closing the deal for that bar , she mentioned that we were looking for a house , and someone said , Well , go talk to those guys at the end of the bar . They re real cowboys , and she went down . The guys said , Oh yeah , I work at a ranch . We ve got a place that would work for you . Showed some pictures , and that s what it was . It s in Lebec , and so we let Lebec play Lebec . The title of the episode is The Promise . When Tim came up with the idea at the end of last season that Ava would say she was scared and Raylan said , Do n t be , everything s gon na be fine to me , that s what the whole final season was about . And it goes back to the pilot , when she says , The minute you walked in , I knew everything was gon na be all right . With Ava , Boyd , and Raylan all alive , you leave the door open for a reunion , a movie , a spinoff ? Is that anything you d consider down the line?Well , we ll see . I mean , it s taken over 20 years for Full House to get another shot on Netflix . So hopefully it does n t take us that long . [ Laughs . ] Yes , we ve left the door open , and it would all depend on story and appetite . But there was no point in killing these guys off . They did n t deserve it . Well , Boyd did , but Raylan had to make a different choice .",

		"paragraph": "Just how far will the Kardashians go to stay in the headlines ? That s a current debate among Kardashian konspiracy theorists who are suspicious about how the family s triple baby news aligns with Season 10 of their E! reality show . We ended the month of September with the news that not one , not two , but three Kardashian-Jenner girls had babies on the way . First , rumors swirled that Kim , 36 , and Kanye West were expecting their third child via surrogate early next year . Then , two more bombshells dropped : It was reported that Kylie , 20 , was expecting her first child with boyfriend , rapper Travis Scott , and Khlo , 33 , also had a baby on the way with her basketball beau , Tristan Thompson . So far , Kim is the only one who has confirmed anything although sources tell Yahoo Lifestyle it s true that both Khlo and Kylie are pregnant . The internet had a field day speculating that momager Kris Jenner orchestrated the pregnancies to coincide with the new season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians . But while the funny memes have passed , the suspicion for some is still there . She did n t actually orchestrate anything â€¦ right ?! As detailed by Vox , the theory goes something like this : Back in 2014 , the website Blind Gossip posted an item suggesting a certain TV maven was trying to get the cast on this show excited about a new story line in which three of the women on the show â€¦ all pregnant â€¦ at the same time ! Fast forward to September 2017 , and here we are . Although Kim is the only one who has confirmed the happy news on a super teaser for the new season , mind you we suspect the other sisters wo n t stay mum too much longer as they tend to like to release bombshell news on their show . But the question remains : How likely is it that Mama Jenner conspired to create three pregnancies timed with the show s 10th anniversary ? Do n t worry , we ve investigated . I think the most common misconceptions is that pregnancy is something you can control , Aimee Eyvazzadeh , a fertility expert and reproductive endocrinologist based in San Francisco , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Like you saw with Khlo , she went to a fertility clinic with Lamar Odom , and she was open about how she has polycystic ovary syndrome , which can make it more difficult to get pregnant . Then there s Kim , who was working separately with a surrogate â€¦ so to think the triple pregnancy was some kind of mastermind by the head of the Kardashian family , it s a nice theory . But no . It s not that easy . Eyvazzadeh , who is n t treating any of the Kardashians , does think it s realistic to assume the timing of the announcement was manipulated after all , it seemed like mere moments after Kim talked about having a surrogate , the announcement came that she was pregnant . It s possible they announced everything closer together for the effect they re trying to get , she says . But while it seems unlikely that the pregnancies were orchestrated , Diane Tober , an assistant professor at the University of California , San Francisco Institute for Health and Aging , says it s possible with some intensive planning . It could very easily be done using fertility medications , hypothetically speaking , Tober tells Yahoo Lifestyle . If they are all getting pregnant through in vitro fertilization rather than through sexual intercourse , they could potentially time their cycles to coincide . The way this could be done is through fertility medications , first using birth control/oral contraceptives to get control over the timing of the menstrual cycle , then start using injectable fertility drugs to control when ovulation occurs , stimulate ovaries to produce more eggs , and then surgically extract the eggs , fertilize them with partner s sperm , and then implant the embryo ( s ) . We know Kim is already using a surrogate , so her cycle or a donor s , if they used an egg donor would already be timed to sync with the surrogate . If they re using fertility treatments with Kim , they all know how it works , I m sure . Tober , who is also not treating the Kardashians , says that once two or more women have synced up their menstrual cycles using birth control , they can then follow up with drugs that can make them more fertile during ovulation . And syncing cycles is n t difficult . Tober , who is currently doing research with egg donors and working on a documentary film called The Perfect Donor about the process , says that this aspect of the process is fairly quick . Egg donors go through it all the time , and it really only takes a matter of a month or less on birth control to sync up with the intended parent , and then she and the intended parent are good to go , Tober explains . It can happen in a short period of time less than a couple of months . It s basically taking the control of the woman s natural cycle away medically , and then syncing control of the cycle so two women can line up and be matched at the same time . Which means , Tober notes , that the Kardashians definitely did n t need three years to pull off this plan . But Eyvazzadeh wants to remind everyone that getting pregnant is n t that simple . If only getting pregnant were that easy , she exclaims . People do n t realize until they re actually trying how hard it is to get pregnant . Each ovulation has a 15 percent pregnancy rate , even in a woman s late 20s and early 30s . Human beings are n t cats , bunnies or mice . Eyvazzadeh continues : Let s say you have Kylie . Her pregnancy rate from IVF is probably 90 percent because of her age . Then Khlo s rate is more like 75 percent . But still , even women like that working through ovulation and medication , to get them to ovulate on the same day , you re still dealing with human biology and a low pregnancy rate . Everyone s ovulation is different . Everyone ovulates on a different day , and you re not going to ovulate on the same exact day as your sister . And as Tober points out , infertility is a serious issue for many women looking to get pregnant . Many , many people have problems conceiving , she says . Especially as people are looking to get pregnant and reproduce later in life , the mother could be facing natural fertility declines with age . Still , both agree the timing of it all is interesting . I do n t know what their sex life is like , but it s very unusual for three sisters to be pregnant at the exact same time , Tober says . It could ve been chance , but it seems like there s a little more planning to it . They all look to me to be at different stages , Eyvazzadeh adds . But there s no such thing as a sister fertility theory , where being around your sister a lot means you sync up your pregnancies . My sister and I were pregnant at the same time , but we were eight months apart . So while we may not have the definitive answer on whether or not Kris Jenner is a fertility wizard at least , not until she admits as much on an episode of her reality show one thing s for sure : If it s true , she may have a lucrative fallback career . Says Eyvazzadeh , For Kris to pull this off , she would have to be God . If she did that , I want to know what hocus-pocus she s got going on , because I want to offer that to my patients . That s pretty amazing . Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle : Follow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed , every day .",

		"paragraph": "The tax cuts Congress is likely to pass by the end of the year will benefit many Americans , harm some and leave others unaffected . Perhaps it s no surprise that Republicans across the country will benefit more from the cuts than Democrats or Independents , according to a new Yahoo Finance analysis of election data . The legislation , likely to pass with majority Republican support and virtually no Democratic votes , will generally provide bigger tax cuts for higher earners , in terms of both the percentage increase in after-tax income , and the dollar value of that income . So the party with wealthier members is likely to enjoy more of the benefits . Anecdotal reporting suggests Democrats have become the party of affluent urban elites , while Republicans increasingly count blue-collar workers and the rural poor among their numbers . While those trends may be legitimate , it is also true that Republican voters are wealthier in general than either Democrats or Independents . Yahoo Finance analyzed data from a comprehensive study of 2016 voters conducted by American National Election Studies , a nonpartisan research group . The survey covered more than 3,900 voters both before and after the 2016 elections . Here s how the parties break down by income : The portion of Republicans with incomes over $ 100,000 is nearly 5 percentage points higher than the portion of Democrats meeting that threshold . At the lower end , the portion of Democrats with incomes below $ 50,000 is 13 points higher than the portion of Republicans . We sliced the numbers another way , to see what percentage of each group had household income above the national median , which is around $ 59,000 . Since the income data is split into $ 5,000 increments , we calculated the portion of each group with incomes above $ 60,000 : So a larger portion of Republicans has incomes above $ 100,000 and above the national median , making the GOP the wealthiest party . Democrats are the least wealthy . Independents generally fall in the middle . So why will tax cuts benefit the Republicans more ? Because the more you earn , the bigger your tax cuts are likely to be . The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has produced the best estimate so far of how the tax cuts will affect individual taxpayers . Here s their analysis of the Senate legislation , which is most similar to the final bill House and Senate negotiators seem to have agreed on as of Dec. 13 . The arrows show where the net effects are for each income group : The size of the tax break increases in both percentage and dollar terms the higher up the income ladder you go . The top 20 % of earners , with household incomes above $ 112,000 or so , would see an average tax cut of 2 % , or $ 5,420 per year . The bottom 20 % would see an average tax cut of 0.3 % , or $ 40 per year . The final legislation may be even more generous to the wealthy , because it would cut the top rate from 39.6 % to 37 % , whereas the Senate bill would only have cut it to 38.5 % . Since there are more Republicans than Democrats ( or Independents ) in the upper-income group , R s would benefit more than D s . That s in addition to another change that will disproportionately benefit people who live in low-tax states which heavily lean Republican and punish residents of high-tax states , which heavily lean Democratic . Capping the total amount of deductions for state and local taxes to $ 10,000 could generate a big tax hit for people who itemize their deductions and claim well in excess of $ 10,000 in state and local taxes today . That s one big reason a package of tax cuts could actually raise taxes for at least 11 million U.S. taxpayers . Some Republicans have even likened their tax bill as death to Democrats , indicating premeditated intent to harm members of the other party . The Trump tax cuts seem overwhelmingly likely to pass . But that does n t mean they ll be permanent . The unpopularity of the overall plan suggests Democrats could dismantle some of the cuts if they retake control of the government in 2020 or later . Until then , we re likely to have a very uneven set of tax cuts improving some people s finances and harming other people s along with a lot of bitterness about the designated winners and losers .

		"paragraph": "Hive One of the worst-kept secrets in Silicon Valley is that it takes a whole lot of human labor to make artificial intelligence ... intelligent . The best example : When Google 's reCAPTCHA pages ask you to identify street signs or storefronts in photos before you can log in , you 're proving you 're not a robot , sure . You 're also providing valuable , human insight into what a street sign looks like , which is extremely useful data when you 're trying to train a self-driving car , or a smart security camera . The whole concept was memorably lampooned in an episode last year of HBO 's \" Silicon Valley . \" Enter Hive , a Silicon Valley-based startup that 's embracing this human element to provide AI-powered image recognition that 's \" orders of magnitude better than Google , \" as cofounder Kevin Guo puts it . Guo 's cofounder Dmitriy Karpman actually dropped out of a prestigious PhD program at Stanford University to make Hive a reality Guo got his Masters degree there before entering the tech industry . The secret of Hive , says Guo , is that it 's turned training an AI into a kind of game one with real cash prizes . Over 600,000 people have signed up for Hive Work , a smartphone app and website , to help train its AI systems . Hive Work asks users to do things like categorize images ( a photo of a car might fall under \" automobile \" and \" transport \" ) , or to transcribe a short snipped of audio , or , like Google reCAPTCHA , to identify all the birds in a photo . The money is n't much , Guo acknowledges , but it adds up to \" tens of dollars \" pretty quickly , and it 's easy enough that you can \" play \" from your phone while you 're on your commute . And , hey , money is money . \" What 's the alternative ? Playing Candy Crush Saga and losing money , \" jokes Guo . The collected human insight is used to train up AI systems for customers like NASCAR , which uses the Hive Data product to track how often and how long a corporate logo is displayed on screen during a race , which is information that advertisers love having , says Guo . Hive also has other AI products , including Hive Predict , an AI-powered tool for helping companies use their data to spot patterns . Hive employs about 60 people , and has raised $ 30 million or so in venture capital from investors including PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel 's Founders Fund . That makes Hive a veritable David versus Silicon Valley Goliaths like Google , which is considered the company at the bleeding edge of what 's possible with AI . Indeed , Guo says that if it just came down to sheer manpower , Hive would n't stand a chance . Google , Microsoft , Amazon , and others have enticed the leading minds in AI to their sides with hefty pay packages that are far beyond what almost any startup could afford . \" If I tried to fight Google with PhDs , I 'd lose , \" says Guo . In fact , in an indirect way , Hive could n't exist without Google . The company 's underlying technology is built on a custom version of TensorFlow , an open source artificial intelligence framework first developed by the search giant , and released to the community . This means that , in terms of raw technology , Hive is definitely behind Google . Hive Instead , he says that the community is a big part of Hive 's edge . The 600,000 Hive workers who help label images are tested before they 're allowed to contribute . The system automatically slips in a few \" known \" tasks to test how well they 're paying attention and keep everyone honest . When a customer has a specific project , like recognizing a certain logo , it gets slipped out to that community in the form of a challenge , with payouts adjusted for difficulty . And so , while Hive 's underlying AI technology is actually built on a customized version of Google 's free , open source TensorFlow framework , Guo boasts that his company has a tremendous trove of high-quality , human-vetted AI training data that not even the search giant can match . Hive takes the data , trains the AI , and provides the tools to its customers to see what it came up with . Guo says it 's the easiest way for companies to get started with AI . Beyond the data , Guo says that it 's a big advantage that Hive has sunk millions into its own server and networking infrastructure . It means that Hive has total control over its technological stack , Guo says , as it continues to refine its technology . But he also says that it 's become a boon when talking to customers , too . As the major tech titans increasingly compete with even the largest , most established corporations , Guo says that its customers are finding that it would be \" foolish \" to trust a Google or an Amazon with the sensitive data that powers artificial intelligence .

And while her Givenchy wedding gown was a departure from the grand ballgown Eugenie wore to wed Jack Brooksbank , their reception dresses were just as dissimilar .

The Princess of York tasked Zac Posen with her second dress , a custom gown in what appears to be a soft shade of blush , rather than bridal white . While Meghan 's second dress designer , Stella McCartney , is best known for her ready-to-wear and eco-conscious design ethos ( leading many to think Eugenie would work with her on something for her big day ) , Posen is best known for eveningwear and not just any ol' gowns . His sculptural silhouettes have graced the world 's best red carpets , his work has been compared to that of couturiers , and he is best known for draping , corsetry , and pleating that forms and shapes the body to flatter each and every asset . His gowns nip waists and accentuate curves while being all about fine detail and Eugenie 's gown did n't fall far from his signature style . Eugenie 's gown , like Meghan 's , was neither beaded nor lace , but it was in no way simple . The visual interest abounded an ethereal chiffon skirt , hand-pleated bodice , strong shoulders , a neckline that hearkened to the folded back detail of her ceremony gown , a subtle basque waistline , long sleeves , and more . Meghan Markle 's second dress was far less intricate and far more body-baring than Eugenie 's , showing off her enviable frame and toned arms in a different way than Eugenie 's fully covered silhouette . Meghan 's second dress called to her ceremony gown only in its simplicity and its shade Markle opted for a crisp , bright white for her two looks , while Eugenie 's gowns were ivory and borderline blush . Eugenie 's bridal looks were all about intricate detail and subtle fashion risks like the daring choice to forgo a veil , opt for a not-so-white reception dress , don emeralds for a pop of color , and work with Peter Pilotto on a custom fabric rather than lace or a matte crepe . Her bridal gowns , some would say , were almost a sophisticated , toned down version of the looks we 've seen her wear in years past . Meghan , however , likes to keep things sleek and chic , and her reception gown appeared to be the epitome of her personal style . Between the two royal brides , one thing is certain each used their second dress as a less fussy , and more adventurous expression of their personal style , while insuring their silhouettes were sophisticated .

		"paragraph": "Imagine if LeBron James left the NBA and took 40 players with him to launch a rival basketball league . That s what Paul Rabil , America s top lacrosse player , is doing . Rabil , the closest thing the sport has to a remotely recognizable star , has played in Major League Lacrosse for 10 years of the league s 18-year history . Beginning next June , Rabil will play instead for the Premier Lacrosse League , which he and his brother cofounded with investments from Raine Group , Chernin Group , CAA , and Blum Capital . Rabil s venture is a shot across the bow for Major League Lacrosse , which bodybuilder Jake Steinfeld founded in 2000 and sold to New Balance owner Jim Davis in 2004 . And MLL is going on the offensive about the launch of the PLL . It is no coincidence that one week before Rabil announced the Premier Lacrosse League , his old league rolled out a comprehensive rebranding effort promising a new look for the MLL logo , website , and all league apparel . MLL also has a new commissioner , former ESPN executive Sandy Brown , who joined in February . Brown says , I ve gotten the owners to agree to invest in digital . I want to create more content that allows for greater sponsor opportunities , greater engagement by fans . Rome was n t built in a day , but I think you re going to see a much different flavor of MLL next season . As for what Rabil is up to ? Brown says : He did n t want to be part of an org chart . But a rising tide lifts all boats . And we have a different model from PLL : they re looking at individual players , we look at things through the lens of our teams and our cities . Rabil says that s exactly right : PLL is laser-focused on making its players into marketable stars . The league s six teams are not tied to cities , but follow a tour-based model where they will roam across 12 venues around the country . By going tour-based , we become national overnight , Rabil says . City allegiance , we saw it with the World Series last night , it s incredible â€¦ this sport is n t quite there yet . But you also look at LeBron James . Look at Cristiano Ronaldo . LeBron has played for three different teams , growing his following , increasing ticket sales with each landing stop . Cristiano Ronaldo has played for three different continents . Millennials and Gen-Z follow the athletes new media has enabled that . The inaugural PLL season starts on June 1 , 2019 , and will culminate in a championship weekend on Sept. 21 . All games will be broadcast by NBC Sports . MLL s games are streamed on the OTT network Lax Sports Network ( LSN ) and , beginning next season , one game of the week will go on ESPN Plus . ( Last season the MLL game of the week streamed on Twitter . ) Many sports fans in America have no idea there is any professional lacrosse league . Does the sport really need two ? Maybe not . If Rabil s PLL is successful right away , it could be very bad for MLL . Rabil says the problems in MLL were player salaries and player marketing . He aims to address both . He s signed 140 players for his league ( most of them poached from MLL ) , and each one is getting a full-time wage ( four times higher than MLL pay on average , Rabil says ) plus healthcare and the same shares in the league that its executives are getting . Rabil looked to the World Surf League ( WSL ) and Professional Bull Riders ( PBR ) as examples of the same structure . We looked at it much like a Silicon Valley technology startup would for their early-stage employees , Rabil says . Our athletes are employees and builders and owners of this business . As for branding the players better , PLL will give players open-source access to digital content like game images and highlight films . In the big leagues , this is unheard of the NFL is especially restrictive of what its players and even its own teams can post on social media . Rabil wants to help the players build themselves into brands the way he has : So we re kind of injecting rocket fuels into their social platforms . There is a huge divide right now between lacrosse s rapid growth at the youth level and the lack of awareness of its professional level . Part of the problem may be the sport s image in America as being mostly white , wealthy young men at elite colleges . Critics could point out that PLL s backers play to that image : Raine Group is full of former college lacrosse players Chernin Group owns bro blog Barstool Sports , and Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini is on the advisory board . The stereotypes are real , Rabil says . We needed to find the right investors that could be strategic across business , sports , and media â€¦ What s been great there is , because of the roots of lacrosse , it was one conversation â€¦ it was n t , â€˜ Tell me how lacrosse functions . ' Rabil says he is n t trying to take down MLL in fact , he says PLL at first considered a partnership . We always wanted to figure out a way to work with them , so we went through a few partnership discovery processes , he says . Business dynamics kick in , and sometimes a deal does n t get done . But Rabil also says the sport of lacrosse requires a professional body that can unlock commercial viability and provide the right distribution , get behind the best players in the world , to bring that exponential growth curve . Translation : Major League Lacrosse has n t done that . Listen to Paul Rabil on the Yahoo Finance Sportsbook podcast below . Daniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance .

		"paragraph": "MEXICO BEACH , Fla. ( AP ) Tom Garcia watched in terror as fingers of water pushed inland across the beach and began filling up his home . His wife handed him a drill and Garcia used screws to pin his front and back door shut . But soon the storm surge from Hurricane Michael was up to his chest . His dogs sat on his bed as it floated . He said it took all of his strength to hold his sliding door shut as the waters outside the glass rose higher than those flooding the house . \" It was life or death , \" Garcia said through tears Friday as he walked amid the destruction in Mexico Beach . Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever make landfall in the U.S. , and this Gulf Coast community of about 1,000 people was in its bullseye Wednesday . While most residents fled ahead of the storm 's arrival , others stayed to face the hurricane . They barely escaped as homes were smashed from their foundations , neighborhoods got submerged , and broken boards , sheet metal and other debris flew through the air . Hector Morales , a 57-year-old restaurant cook , never even thought about evacuating . He grew up in Puerto Rico , where he said \" you learn how to survive a storm . \" His mobile home is n't on the beach . But the canal lined with boat docks behind his home quickly overflowed as the hurricane came inland . Soon , Morales said , his mobile home started floating . \" The water kept coming so fast , it started coming in from everywhere , \" he said as he sat outside on a broken set of stairs lying atop a mattress and other storm debris . \" I had about 3 feet of water in my house . That 's when I decided to jump . \" He got through a window of his home on to the top of his car outside when Morales saw two neighbors wading through the rushing surge . He swam out and grabbed a utility pole , then reached out and helped steady the wading couple . They fought their way onto a fishing boat that had been tied to a palm tree and climbed inside . Morales left his neighbors in a bathroom below the boat 's deck , while he sat in the captain 's chair . He said they stayed in the boat for six hours before the winds calmed and the surge receded . \" I lost everything my clothes , wallet , credit cards , \" he said . \" But I made it . \" Bill Shockey , 86 , refused when his daughter pleaded with him to leave Mexico Beach . He said he did n't want to leave behind his collection of \" Gone with the Wind \" dishes and antique dolls . So he stashed those valuables up high in a closet before heading to his daughter 's newly built two-story home next door . With a pocket full of cigars and his cat named Andy , Shockey watched the hurricane roll in from an upstairs bedroom . The wind shredded the roof of his single-story home . Water rose nearly to the top of his garage door . A neighbor 's home across the street got shoved off its foundation . Was he scared ? \" Worried , I think , is more like it , \" Shockey said . His daughter 's home took in some floodwaters downstairs , but was otherwise unscathed . Shockey 's own home of 24 years did n't fare so well , though his collectibles survived . \" It 's a wipe out , \" he said , adding that he plans to sell his property rather than rebuild . \" Whenever they want , I 'm going to move in with my son in Georgia . \" For years , Hal Summers has managed Killer Seafood , a Mexico Beach restaurant known for its tuna tacos . Michael destroyed the eatery as well as Summers ' townhome on the beach . Summers rode out the storm at his parent 's house nearby . They had evacuated , but an elderly friend was staying there and Summers promised to watch him . Summers knew they had to get out when , about 30 minutes after the storm made landfall , water surging into the home 's kitchen rose up to his neck . He opened the front door and fell in deeper when he tried to step onto front stairs that had washed away . Summers said his parents recently added a large , outdoor bathroom onto their home and he saw the door was open . The large sink was still above the water . He grabbed a bench that was floating by , and shoved it into the open bathroom to give them something to stand on . Then he helped the elderly man inside . \" I knew we could sit on the sink or we could stand on the sink if we had to , \" Summers said . \" I had to hold the door shut or it would just keep flooding . There was a little crack and I could just see everything flying . I thought , ' Oh my God . ' \" They never had to stand on the bathroom sink . Finally , the flooding receded . While Garcia and his wife survived the hurricane 's wrath , he was out Friday searching for his daughter and mother . Kristen Garcia , 32 , and her 90-year-old grandmother , Jadwiga Garcia , were staying in a second-floor beachfront apartment Wednesday as the storm came ashore . Garcia said his daughter called him to say the apartment was flooding and they had taken shelter in the bathroom . He had n't seen them in the two days since the storm passed , and had n't been able to gain access to their apartment . He had tears in his eyes recalling their last conversation . \" She said , ' Dad , get down here , ' \" Garcia said . \" I said , ' It 's too late . ' \"",

		"paragraph": "As backlash mounts over an umpire s sexist treatment of Serena Williams at the U.S. Open final a match that she eventually lost after being penalized three times , including for a coaching violation she wholeheartedly disputed tennis umpires are reportedly considering refusing to officiate her matches . In Saturday s U.S. Open final , chair umpire Carlos Ramos issued three code violations to Williams , including one for verbal abuse after she called him a thief , which cost her a full game she went on to lose to Japan s Naomi Osaka . Williams and other star players , as well as fans , have criticized Ramos s calls as sexist , noting that male players have subjected umpires to far worse without penalty . Now , umpires are reportedly pushing back . In an interview with The Times of London , an anonymous source revealed that before the U.S. Open even started , chair umpires were unhappy with the event s disorganization when Williams accused Ramos of making sexist calls , they became increasingly angry . As a result , per the source , umpires are thinking about refusing to officiate any matches involving Williams . The Guardian reports , similarly , that tennis top umpires are considering forming a union in the wake of the Williams backlash , as they were disappointed that the Women s Tennis Association and the United States Tennis Association were quick to side with Williams , and that it took the International Tennis Federation nearly two days to vocalize its support for Ramos . As one senior figure put it , umpires felt that Ramos was hung out to dry . There is a lot of unhappiness in the umpiring community because no one is standing up for officials , the source told The Guardian . Umpires keep asking : â€˜ What if it was me in that chair on Saturday ? There is a widespread feeling that Carlos was hung out to dry for nearly 48 hours and that no one is standing up for officials . On Monday , after the ITF defended Ramos s calls , the umpire himself made his first public comment as well , saying , It s an unhappy situation but la carte refereeing does n t exist . According to Fast Company , tennis stars Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have called Ramos crap and stupid respectively , and Rafael Nadal threatened Ramos in 2016 . None were docked a point or a game for it . Related Articles ",

		"paragraph": "Dear Polly , I am exhausted , and I feel like everything I do is wrong . First , the reasons I feel like I should n t even write to you : I have a fantastic husband , a sweet dog , a fulfilling and challenging job , a welcoming and warm faith community , and a small but dedicated circle of friends that keeps me sane . I have hobbies I enjoy , I uphold healthy habits , and I m privileged enough to be in good physical and financial health . But I have this undercurrent roiling beneath the surface that critiques , chastises , and abuses me and that awful voice sounds just like mine . I second guess everything I do , and I mean everything . I ve written and discarded this draft 16 times . I feel like I never measure up to this person I should be . I am never a good-enough wife , good-enough dog owner , good-enough job-performer , not healthy enough , not pretty enough , not smart enough , not enough enough . And at the same time , I am too much : I m too sarcastic , too dry , too cold , too analytical , too driven , too independent , too anxious , too serious , too content with being alone . I know this is something every woman faces , but I feel like I m drowning underneath it all . I am , again , not strong enough . I grew up moving a lot and always being the new kid . I played sports and succeeded in school and had friends and boyfriends and all of the trappings that come with small-town high schools . My parents were n t friends , and I do n t think they ever liked each other , but they imploded when I was 15 . My dad had a secret affair for six years , a second family , a whole thing . He and I got back from a dad-and-daughter vacation and he just left his suitcase in the car and drove away . I am certain that I was profoundly altered by that , and I think I am so tired because I hold onto things and hold up things so that I will never be caught off guard again . I hate surprises and change , and it seems like I assign blame to my actions so that I have a paper trail . I always need evidence , I need cause . I go to therapy , and my lovely therapist talks about how traumatic that event was and how I have shaped myself around it , like you might favor a sprained ankle or sore back . I exercise and practice self-care and do all of the things , all of the time . I m writing to you in the hope that your candid , searing words will make it through the muck of my headspace and help me realize that I can stop holding everything up . Things can fall , and I wo n t . Hopefully . All Wrong Dear All Wrong , There s no way to overstate the trauma of spending time alone with your dad and then having him disappear immediately after that . It sounds like you re facing that enormous tidal wave of sadness and loss in therapy already , but I want to say that I feel very sad for you just hearing about it . I m sad for the girl and sad for the woman and sad for every version of you in between , every day since the day your dad dropped you off and then disappeared , up until today . I m crying in the middle of a packed plane just thinking about how bad that must ve been for you and how bad it still must be . I understand feeling like nothing you do is good enough . A few years ago , I went through a rough time when I felt like a messy , embarrassing failure every single day . That s not how I seemed from the outside , but that was my experience of each day . A lot of good and bad stuff happened between then and now , but one central dimension of my life slowly evolved and changed : I resolved not to give myself a hard time every second of every day anymore . I figured I could just shut off that voice , but it was n t that simple . Once I noticed how often and how vehemently I disparaged myself , it felt overwhelming . It sounds like this is where you are now . The full scope of my self-hatred and self-doubt shocked me . It almost felt like I was trying to track down one outspoken , angry ranter who kept yelling at me from a high window or a street corner or a passing car , but when I finally found her , she was hiding out in a church full of angry ranters just like her , and they were all mad at me for different reasons . Easy enough to shut down one voice . But how could I defeat an entire religion built on the foundation of my awfulness ? Standing up at the front of the church and shouting back at the congregation did n t work . They would n t listen to me . They thought I was the worst , why would they listen ? Telling them I forgave them did n t help . Why would they care ? Trying to love them was impossible . They were n t lovable to me . It was depressing to even think about them . For a while I tried to celebrate them . This is funny , really , I would reassure myself . It s amazing how many of them there are . This is absurd and hilarious ! That at least gave me enough distance that I could hear their voices and notice when they were affecting my actions . Sometimes I would even sing their songs along with them without knowing it . Their songs were about this perfect , better person I could become , if I would just get my shit together and be less lazy and be less anxious and be more serene and organized and effective and beautiful and perfect and good . But the more I visited the church , the more I noticed that my choices and ideas about myself mostly came from them . It was as if I was worshipping at the same church every day without even knowing it . What does that mean , exactly ? It means that I walked around looking for proof that my Church of Hating Me was a valid one . Every hint of hesitation from other people , every faint whiff of neutrality or mixed feelings or mild disapproval felt like an outright rejection . And each rejection and perceived rejection added to the enormous pile of proof that I was bad and I should fix myself . Even when I was n t interacting with other people , small glitches in my day always meant that those people in the church were right : Here are bills I have n t paid , because I m disorganized . Here is my misbehaving child , because I am a bad mother . Here is my blank unlovable face in the mirror , because I do n t know how to get a handle on my skin or style my hair or put off aging like everyone else somehow magically does . So I could n t just shut down one voice . I had to go back to the church and study the basic beliefs of my religion in order to overthrow those beliefs . And the central belief was not just that I was selfish and lazy and bossy and I needed way too much just to muddle through the day , but that when people did n t like me or even flat-out misunderstood me , they were catching a glimpse of my rotten inner self that was real . Even when the misunderstanding was preposterous they thought I was incredibly full of myself , say , when I walked around all day feeling jittery with self-doubt I was still beholden to those interpretations . I felt like it was my duty to fix myself based on their misperceptions , even when there was nothing to fix . My sense is that a lot of women in particular feel unbelievably accountable to other people in general . That was one of the horrors of the Kavanaugh hearings . While Kavanaugh himself was shocked and enraged that someone of his standing should ever be held accountable for his past actions ( not to mention held accountable for his lies about those actions ) , Christine Blasey Ford seemed anxious to apologize not just for gaps in her memory or any inability to understand the question . She seemed to wince every time she was misunderstood , as if that was her fault . A lot of us recognized our own shame in her demeanor . We were reminded of how often , as girls , we encountered other people s laughter as a sign we were bad , a sign we were doing something wrong , a sign that we d made some unforgivable mistake that would brand us as unlovable and irredeemable forever and ever . I think lots of women feel accountable for other people s misperceptions of them . But just think about how absurd it is , to collect and make meaning out of every time someone misunderstands you not to mention every time you unfairly misunderstand yourself . That s where all of this praying to a bad religion leads , after all . It leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of your own motives and desires and beliefs . It leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of your own CHARACTER . When you write that you re too sarcastic , too dry , too cold , too analytical , too driven , too independent , too anxious , too serious , too content with being alone , you believe that these things add up to a bleak snapshot of who you are . What I see , as someone outside your weird religious cult , is someone I d love to spend time with . What do I like more than independent , sarcastic , analytical , anxious women who like to be alone ? Nothing ! Everyone I know is sarcastic and anxious . Any of the women I really love could be described as cold or serious or independent . And beyond that , one reason you might encounter yourself as cold or serious hey , why not take the leap to joyless ? is that you feel like you have to use most of your energy and brain power just to ward off surprises or plot twists that could unravel your sanity at any second . Your seriousness comes from the amount of energy you exert every second , just to be good or almost acceptable or not a complete laughingstock or disaster . You are n t even praying along with your congregation you re standing outside the church holding the doors closed so no one will know the truth about you and destroy everything you have . You expect the world to end at any second . Why would n t you ? You spent a great time on vacation with your dad and then he disappeared . Disaster comes without warning . You have to be ready next time . Instead , this is what I want you to do : Walk away from the church and never look back . Will the parishioners at the Church of Hating You leave and tell other people about how awful you are ? Will new people wander in and find out you re bad ? You ca n t care anymore . You do have the option of coming out of the church and telling people what you really think of yourself . I had an era where I liked to announce that I was neurotic and messy and ridiculous , over and over again . I m not as interested in doing that anymore , because I see that it was yet another way of apologizing for myself , and I no longer feel that I have that much to apologize for . These days , I just try to notice where I am without judging myself for it . I notice my moods , which seem to change more often than the weather . I notice how often I feel a little queasy or nervous . I notice when I m getting sad or angry or elated . And I try very hard not to label either my moods or my everyday choices as if they re horrifically embarrassing and wrong . I m analytical and I m also anxious , just to name two of your so-called flaws . I m sensitive and I have a lot of thoughts and opinions about small things . I have a lot of fears . This is just how I m wired , full stop . I experience mild challenges and surprises as very difficult and confusing a lot of the time . I do n t like feeling like my fate is in someone else s hands . But you know what ? I m a human being . Most humans are like me . Everyone has their stumbling blocks and baggage . I do n t know that many easy-breezy motherfuckers , God bless them , and they are n t some paragon of specialness either way . We were all born to be exactly who we are . That s partly why I do n t use words like celebrate the fact that you re a mess as often in this column anymore . Everyone is a mess on the inside , we re just in varying degrees of denial about it . I do n t mind showing some of the things other people hide on that front anymore , at least not most of the time , because I do n t think it s consequential . I do think of myself as slightly broken , but I think most people are a tiny bit broken and I love broken people . The church tells you that you need to try harder . They say that you have to fix this . But they re wrong . You do n t have to do a goddamned thing . In order to finally let go of everything you re holding up , you need to embrace and welcome in all of your fears about what will happen if you are n t prepared . You need to look at them and unravel them . And you also need to let go of this imaginary better version of you who s always a few feet ahead but you can never catch up to her . She might seem close , but you know what ? Forget her . She is n t here , where you are . You are the better version of you , because you re right here . Be who you are now . Be disappointing and cold and solitary if that s who you are . It s not a moral failure to be less than perfect , less than warm , less than social . Yesterday I got a blowout for a reading I was doing in New York ( go buy my new book of essays here ! ) and someone said I looked like Julia Roberts ( not true , but thank you , someone ! ) . Today my blowout looks frayed and crumpled I look like an aging Tesla fan with a pill problem . Who cares ? I m done with this feeling like I m always getting it wrong . I like myself just fine , at last , even as I astonish myself with my changing needs and my changing moods and my fragility . You re strong already and you do n t even notice it because that church full of confused motherfuckers is shouting so loudly in your ear . You ll be able to handle surprises , once you forgive yourself for not handling them well . You do n t have to work so hard anymore to keep the church doors closed . Tell your husband and friends your fears about what s terrible about you , and ask them to tell you directly that it s okay to be angry and cold and sad and weak . Here I ll say it first : It s okay to be angry and cold and sad and weak . It really is . It feels good to admit that you do n t have control over much . It feels good to admit that you re on a wild ride that s yours alone . That s what feeling truly alive is about : acknowledging your powerlessness and taking it all in anyway , instead of fighting it . Feeling alive is all about living in reality , as harrowing as that can be . This lady next to me does n t love me for crying again , but it s okay . This is how it feels to be alive without internalizing other people s misperceptions all the time . I want you to stop trying to catch up with that perfect ghost they sing about in your church , and join me here instead . Let s be broken and cold and anxious and sarcastic together . It s not just okay , it s hot to be old and really fucking weird . Revel in who you already are , effortlessly , and leave your imaginary impossible self behind forever . It s time to leave the church . It s time to close the prayer book that was forever opened to that one reading about the little girl who was waiting , heartbroken , for her dad to come home . It s time to stop trying so hard to prevent the next disaster . Let s walk out of the church together , into the sunshine , into the pouring rain , crying and laughing , old and weird and hot and strange as hell and wide awake . We did n t write these hymns . We can forget them . We are not accountable to other people s misperceptions of us . The world will keep spinning with or without our help . We are free .

[ Follow Dunks Do n t Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] Durant gets the point , too , since the 2014 NBA MVP said as much to Chinese media outlet Sina ( via Bay Area News Group s Diamond Leung ) during a barnstorming tour through Asia on behalf of Nike , when asked how he broke the news of his abrupt departure to his partner in Oklahoma City for eight years . I just told him . I just let him know how I felt . Obviously , our relationship probably wo n t ever be the same again , but it s something I wanted to do and I expressed that to him . Hopefully , he respected it . We go live to Westbrook , probably , wherever he is , mostly likely in the Bat-cave trying on his Bat-suit : For what it s worth , Durant expanded on his new role as the NBA s latest super-villain in Oakland . It s difficult , because I m not used to this much attention , but I m getting used to it . Obviously , people do n t like me right now , but it is what it is . I ca n t please them all . I ve got to still go out there and handle my business . They re not going to get up at 9 o clock in the morning and work on their game for me . I ve got to do all of that on my own , so I ca n t really worry about people on the outside and the noise that s going on , because I ve got ta go to sleep at night , I ve got to get up and I ve got to perform . I ve got to do all that stuff , so it is what it is . Once we start playing games , I ll feel a little better , but right now it s definitely a change . It s a different vibe going around , but I ll get used to it . Forgetting for a moment Durant just said , They re not going to get up at 9 o clock in the morning , as if that s an early wake-up call for his naysayers , the fact remains Westbrook is now among those people on the outside of Durant s everyday existence , so the question becomes : What now for Russ ? An informed Howard Beck attempted to answer that question for Bleacher Report , in one long breath . Well , it s not altogether clear yet . I do n t think anybody knows for certain what Russell Westbrook wants to do or intends to do next summer , but that said : Let s just say there s a very strong suspicion a strong belief among rival GMs that Russell Westbrook is not intending to stay , that he would leave next summer when he hits free agency , and because of that the logical next step is that [ Thunder GM ] Sam Presti , who is always ahead of the curve on these things , will look to trade him . Now , I do n t know that s happening right this moment , but if we know anything about Sam Presti and the Thunder how proactive they ve been in past years , trading [ James ] Harden the year before they had to , trading Reggie Jackson at the first sign of trouble , trading Serge Ibaka on draft night a year ahead of his free agency we know if there s any concern that Westbrook ( will ) leave that they are going to be aggressive . And what I m hearing here in Las Vegas from some GMs is that , not only do they think that Westbrook will get traded , that it will be sooner rather than later , probably before the season starts , and that the most likely destination right now would be the Boston Celtics . Now , that s not surprising . Anybody who s been following the NBA the last couple years , we know Boston has been loading up on assets , a ton of picks including all those great picks from the Brooklyn Nets they ve got a bunch of young players , they have the ability to create a package that could get Westbrook there without giving up key pieces . They could still have Isaiah Thomas , Al Horford , who they just signed , hold onto Jae Crowder , presumably , and add Westbrook to that . Because that s the concern or the challenge for any team trying to trade for Westbrook . Not only do you have to be concerned about his free agency next summer , and you re going to want some assurance that he would want to stay , but you ve got to be able to trade for him while still having enough players for him to play with when he arrives . Got all that ? It s a load to process , because it s a lot of self-described speculation from Beck , who we can safely assume is as plugged in as anyone with general managers at Las Vegas Summer League . The one thing we know for certain is Westbrook becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer . But that creates an issue for both the Thunder and any potential Westbrook suitors . Presti would be wise to acquire something in return for his lone remaining superstar , in order to avoid what happened with Durant again next summer , so long as he s convinced the five-time All-Star will leave Oklahoma City . But he d have to be absolutely convinced , because losing another superstar in his prime does not bode well for the Thunder . After all , if you ca n t make it work with any of three perennial MVP candidates Durant , Westbrook and Harden then your future is bleak , my friend . As for Westbrook s potential suitors , Boston would absolutely be in the mix , and you can be sure Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge will place the call . In fact , I m sure he already has . The Celtics can offer any combination of Thomas , Crowder , Avery Bradley and/or Marcus Smart all talented young players signed to relatively cheap long-term contracts along with some of their picks , which include Brooklyn s next two first-rounders . Presti will try to increase the pot , and Ainge will hold on to as many chips as possible , but few teams could match Boston s best package . But the C s , like any potential Westbrook suitor , would need assurance he would stay in one place , and such an assurance would be hard to come by . Depending on how desperate Westbrook would be to leave OKC , if he wants to become a free agent , there s nothing stopping him from becoming one in a summer when any number of teams will be offering an even more profitable max contract . It s long been rumored Westbrook would like to return to his hometown of Los Angeles , whether it s the Clippers or Lakers , and Ainge would be weary to give up a potential top-five pick or any of the aforementioned players for a one-year Westbrook rental , only to see him leave for the Lakers . Such is the dilemma facing Westbrook , the Thunder and every rumored suitor between now and the time he s either traded or becomes a free agent in 2017 . Get your popcorn ready , because another summer superhero blockbuster could be on the horizon . Only this time Durant is n t co-starring .

The video is somewhat insider baseball in the blogging world , as Cernovich claims a fellow blogger will be remembered for doxxing a 15-year-old , with Cernovich claiming not to care about perceptions . Bautista , who plays super-strongman Drax in the film series , has been active on social media in defending Gunn , who was dismissed by Disney from future editions of Guardians after old tweets of questionable taste were brought to light by Cernovich and other bloggers . Gunn apologized for the comments and said they were jokes made when he was in a different stage of life . His dismissal has created polarized opinions on Disney s actions , among them an open letter from members of the Guardians cast . While Disney allegedly briefly reconsidered whether to bring Gunn back , it ultimately decided against the move . The company has since moved on , but has put production of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 on hold while things are sorted out .

Ir al quiosco m s cercano y comprar el sobre de cromos , colocar las figuritas en la p gina correspondiente del lbum e intercambiar con los compa eros en busca de ese hueco imposible de llenar ha sido , y sigue siendo , parte del ritual cotidiano de muchos infantes . Las estampillas de tem ticas varias siempre han sido muy populares , aunque quiz s , como fiel reflejo de lo que es nuestra sociedad , las que m s xito han tenido han sido las dedicadas al f tbol , a la Primera Divisi n de cada temporada a o tras a o . N tese que cuando se habla de Primera Divisi n se hace referencia a la categor a masculina , la que siempre acapara minutos en televisi n y titulares en prensa . Las editoriales nunca han sacado a la venta figuras del campeonato femenino . Quiz s ese sea uno de los motivos por los que las ni as tienden a sentirse excluidas del mundo de la pelota y rara vez participan en el intercambio de cromos . Pero esta situaci n empieza a cambiar por la iniciativa personal de Mar a V zquez , una madre residente en Montijo , en la provincia de Badajoz . Las dos hijas mayores de Mar a tienen 8 y 5 a os y son muy aficionadas al f tbol , motivo por el que ella tom una decisi n ins lita : ante la falta de cromos del torneo femenino , opt por fabricarlas ella misma . Armada con Photoshop y con mucha paciencia , modific la plantilla de las estampillas masculinas est ndar y fue a adiendo los nombres y las fotograf as de las jugadoras de la Liga Iberdrola . Despu s los imprimi y los plastific , en un proceso totalmente artesanal pero de calidad gr fica innegable . Al principio se centr en el Barcelona y el Sevilla , los equipos favoritos de sus ni as . Como la respuesta fue muy positiva , se anim a hacer la colecci n completa abarcando el resto de clubes ( en la Liga hay un total de 16 , muchos de ellos con correspondencia con equipos masculinos , aunque no todos ) . La mayor dificultad de la tarea consisti no tanto en el montaje , sino en encontrar fotograf as de las jugadoras con calidad suficiente , porque para que el resultado sea similar a los referentes masculinos necesita dos im genes en cada cromo : una de la jugadora en acci n y un retrato de cerca . Seg n cuenta en Verne , ha recurrido a Twitter para pedir ayuda a los propios clubes , quienes , en su mayor a , se est n volcando con ella y le han ofrecido su colaboraci n . De momento , V zquez lleva fabricados ya 250 cromos . Sus hijas est n encantadas , ya que se sienten identificadas . Y muchas jugadoras profesionales aplauden la iniciativa : Marta Corredera , delantera del Atl tico de Madrid y la selecci n espa ola , ha sido una de las que la han felicitado . De hecho , la propia cuenta oficial de la Liga Iberdrola se ha comprometido a ayudarle en todo lo posible para que logre completar todas las plantillas y terminar la colecci n . Le faltan a n futbolistas de clubes como el Zaragoza , el Albacete , el Rayo Vallecano , el Sporting de Huelva o el Madrid CFF , pero la repercusi n que est teniendo su proyecto en la red es enorme , con muchos aficionados ( y hasta fot grafos profesionales ) ofreci ndole ayuda , por lo que es de esperar que lo consiga pronto .

		"paragraph": "Bill Maher s use of the N word in making a feeble joke on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher is having multiple repercussions . Minnesota Sen. Al Franken , out on a book tour , has canceled an upcoming appearance on Real Time , saying that while he considers Maher a good friend , what Maher said was inappropriate and offensive . If you have n t heard , Maher was talking to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse on his show last Friday . Maher said he d like to visit Nebraska more often , to which the senator responded , You are welcome . We d love to have you work in the fields with us . Mr. Maher said , Work in the fields ? Senator , I m a house n ***** . No , it s a joke . In the days following the blunder , Maher has benefited from the whiteness of late-night television hosts . Guys like Stephen Colbert , Jimmy Fallon , and Jimmy Kimmel are n t going to start ridiculing Maher , passing judgment , or opining at length about racially charged language they doubtless feel that this is a topic on which they have little authority to either get serious or to joke . Leave it , therefore , to late-night s sharp observers Desus and Mero to offer a cutting yet funny take on Maher s race problem . On Monday s Desus & Mero , the Viceland hosts , ridiculed Maher s it s - a-joke ! protestation , playing the Real Time tape and observing that theN word rolled awfully easily off Maher s tongue . Desus said Maher has a long history of being publicly racist , specifically against Muslims , and played a clip in which Maher said he was upset at the number of British newborns being named Muhammad . The hosts comments about Maher s dating life which they observe is very choco-laticious are particularly choice . Maher is scheduled to do a new show on Friday . Aside from the now-absent Franken , his scheduled guests are former Florida Congressman David Jolly and TV journalist David Gregory . Maher would be idiotic not to scrap that lineup and make sure that every one of his guests that night is black , and to conduct whatever passes as discussion on Real Time from a posture with which Maher is usually unfamiliar : humility . UPDATE : Well , Maher s lineup has been announced , and he s splitting the difference : Jolly and Gregory will appear ( though heaven knows why ) , and Michael Eric Dyson , Ice Cube , and Symone Sanders have been newly added . Sanders is an activist who was press secretary for Bernie Sanders s presidential run Dyson is a well-known academic and author . Ice Cube is Ice Cube . Whatever Sanders , Dyson , and Cube have to say will be well worth heeding by both Maher and his audience . Desus & Mero airs weeknights at 11 p.m. on Viceland . Real Time with Bill Maher airs Friday nights at 10 p.m. on HBO .",

		"paragraph": "Cut-up grocery store melons sold at popular stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe s are at the center of a multi-state outbreak of salmonella . The fruits which include fresh-cut watermelon , honeydew , cantaloupe , and medleys that include these melons were distributed by Caito Foods to stores in Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Michigan , Missouri , North Carolina , and Ohio , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports . The products were sold in clear plastic clamshell containers at Costco , JayC , Kroger , Payless , Owen s , Sprouts , Trader Joe s , Walgreens , Walmart , and Whole Foods/Amazon . The CDC also says there s a chance they may have been distributed to more states and stores . As of now , 60 people have been infected with Salmonella Adelaide after eating the melons , and 31 of those people have been hospitalized . The CDC is urging people to avoid the recalled products and to throw them away or return them to the store where they bought them for a refund . If you have precut melon and are not sure where it came from , it s suggested that you throw that away too . Salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses , 23,000 hospitalizations , and 450 deaths in the U.S. each year , and food is the source of about 1 million of those illnesses , the CDC says . Most people who contract salmonella develop diarrhea , a fever , and stomach cramps about 12 to 72 hours after they ve been infected . They re generally sick for between four and seven days , and most recover without any treatment , the CDC says . However , some people may have diarrhea that s so severe they require hospitalization . Precut melons are generally risky to eat ( as is other precut produce ) , food safety expert Darin Detwiler , director of the Regulatory Affairs of Food and Food Industries program at Northeastern University , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . He says he avoids precut melons unless he s the one who prepares them . Salmonella can get into your melon a few ways , Detwiler explains . It can be on the rind , and if the melon is n t properly cleaned beforehand , salmonella can be transmitted to the cut fruit cross-contamination is also possible during the washing process . There s also a chance that it could be internalized in the fruit , Benjamin Chapman , an associate professor and extension food safety specialist at North Carolina State University , tells Yahoo Lifestyle and in that instance , there s really nothing you could have done in order to make it safer to eat . Storage matters too , Felicia Wu , a professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Michigan State University , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . If the fruit is stored in a way that condensation can happen on the surface , this can increase the odds that it will have bacterial contamination , she says . And if the precut melon is n t stored at a cool enough temperature , it could encourage bacterial growth . The problem with precut melons is that you do n t know how long it s been since it was cut , Detwiler says . The longer it s been , the more time the pathogens have been allowed to double and double again . It s like a ticking time bomb . While this is a little scary , Chapman points out that it is n t new . The risk is there , day in and day out , and it always has been , he says . There are outbreaks all the time , but there are millions of servings that do n t make us sick . If you want to eat melon , the safest thing is to buy it whole and clean it at home before you prepare it . ( You can dilute a capful of bleach in a bucket of water and clean it that way , Detwiler says ) . Then , cut it up and serve it when you know it will be eaten right away , or within a day or two . All that lowers the odds that any pathogens that might be on it wo n t get to proliferate before you eat it . This does n t mean you re guaranteed to get sick if you eat precut melon ( outside of the recalled fruit ) . While Wu urges people with compromised immune systems to be particularly aware of the risk , she says everyone else should just be aware that it s there . I do not think it should be a looming fear in anyone s minds , she says .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for episode 4 of The Bachelorette contains spoilers . Well , this is awkward . Since we last met , rose lovers , all hell has broken loose in Bachelor Nation , thanks to a lethal combination of alcohol , television cameras , and exceptionally bad judgment . The situation is terribly ugly and sad , and it s hard not to feel like everything under the Bachelor Nation umbrella has been sullied by the scandal . On the other hand , what does it have to do with Rachel , the universally-beloved star of The Bachelorette Season 13 ? Other than the fact that The Incident involved a former Bachelorette contestant , the answer is nothing . So with that in mind , let us forge ahead and support Rachel on her journey to find love . In case you forgot where things left off ( and I sure as hell did ) , a quick refresher : Lee told Rachel that Eric yelled at Iggy . Eric found out and then yelled at everyone . Then producers gave us that annoying To Be Continued card and the show disappeared for two weeks . The action resumes with Eric telling Lee , Do n t talk to me ever ! Of course , the pot-stirring singer/songwriter has no intention of leaving his rival alone . I m not willing to make peace with Eric , he informs us . I do n t care about those other people . Also , is it me or did Lee s hair grow two inches higher since the last episode ? With making trouble for Eric in mind , Lee heads off to talk to Rachel again rudely interrupting her chat with Kenny , I might add . But just when you think he s going to spend his time badmouthing Eric , instead he brings Rachel a block of wood roughly engraved with the word enchanting , which Lee carved with his dead grandpa s knife , or something . Dude , that s not a gift . This is a gift : We interrupt this recap to school three idiot contestants on the English language : Quirk ( n ) : A peculiarity of action , behavior , or personality . Quark ( n ) : A hypothetical particle in physics . Cork ( n ) : That thing that goes in a wine bottle . End of lesson . Here s something interesting : Dean is attempting to explain that Lee does n t like black folks , though he s being a bit too diplomatic for the producer s liking . The only people that I ve seen Lee pick fights with have been people not the people that , uh , he s been used to seeing on a daily basis â€¦ from a cultural perspective . You know exactly what I mean , when I say that , replies Dean , who is not about to be caught on camera calling Lee a racist . ( Just leave that to the Internet . ) Man , will this cocktail party never end ? While Rachel and Bryan make out some more , Kenny confronts Lee about interrupting his conversation with Rachel . Things get heated enough that the Bachelorette can hear the conversation from another room . Lee , who gets tickled whenever he pisses people off , plays dumb with Kenny which only makes Kenny angrier . Rachel , meanwhile , is ridiculously annoyed by all the drama . If I m 100 percent honest , I was disappointed by the guys tonight , she says grimly . The pressures I feel about being a black woman , and what that is â€¦ Rachel , who s getting emotional , stops herself for a moment , and then continues . I did not want to get into all of this tonight , and I already know what people are going to say about me and judge me for the decisions that I m making . I m going to be the one who has to deal with all that . Gah ! I hate seeing Rachel upset especially at the prospect of ignorant people disrespecting her . You are a queen , Rachel Lindsay , and Bachelor Nation loves you . Chris Harrison s Spidey sense must have been tingling , because suddenly he is by the Bachelorette s side , offering to help her facilitate anything . In this case , all Rachel wants is to get the rose ceremony over with . So let s do this . Robot roll call : Will , Dean , Jonathan , Peter , Adam , Bryan , Matt , Josiah , Jack , Iggy , Kenny , and Lee ( sigh ) join Eric , Anthony and Alex in the winners circle . Which means we must say goodbye to Diggy , Brady , and Bryce . Later , gentlemen ! See you at the Men Tell All . After a toast to saying goodbye to the drama and the negativity and moving forward to something better , we rejoin the Bachelorette on a sailboat in Hilton Head , South Carolina . Once the guys are settled , Dean learns he s getting the first one-on-one date of the week . He and his triangle tattoo are very excited . Rachel brings Dean to an open field , where they sit atop the jeep and drink champagne â€¦ until the blimp arrives . Of course , Dean is terrified of heights , but Rachel promises to hold his hand throughout the entire ordeal . But if you puke , she notes , I m not holding the puke bag . Damn right she s not . Relax , Dean . Team Bachelorette has n t killed anyone â€¦ yet . Rachel peer pressures her date into sitting in the co-pilot s seat and working the controls for a few minutes and darn it if the boy does n t have a little fun . Awww , these two are pretty cute , are n t they ? When the blimp flies over the resort , the guys all grumble that Dean is too young for Rachel , and that she only chose him for the date because he s hot . Damn right she did . Of course , though , Rachel knows Dean is the youngest guy in the house , so over dinner she wants to go deeper and learn whether he s actually ready to get married . They chat about their respective upbringings ( both had strict , religious parents ) , and then Dean reveals that his mother died from breast cancer when he was just 15 . When she was in hospice , Dean hoped that his mother who had gone into remission once before would beat cancer again . I leaned over to her and said , â€˜ Hey mom , when are you coming home again ? And , uh , she leaned over to me and said , â€˜ Never . OOOF . Please excuse me while I go hug my child . Aaand we re back . Rachel is of course incredibly moved by Dean s story which , by the way , gets even sadder . After his mom died , Dean says his family fell apart , and he was basically alone from age 15 to 18 . I hate talking about this , he says , with a sad laugh . Despite , or perhaps because of , his loss , Dean is looking forward to having a very close-knit family . And she LOVES it . Of course , he gets the date rose and the season s first surprise concert , in this case by a guy named Russell Dickerson . He seems nice . The next day , it s time for the group date , starring Alex , Anthony , Peter , Bryan , Jonathan , Adam , Matt , Kenny , Lee , Iggy , Eric , Will and Josiah . Rachel s a little nervous about hosting such a big group , but she s optimistic enough to hope that they ll leave the drama behind . And since they re all going on a boat , Rachel suggests they leave their shirts behind , too . The booze is flowing , as is the showboating ( no pun intended ) . The guys show off their dance moves , their push-up prowess , and their freestyling skillz . Kenny s not bad , but Peter is pretty terrible . Still , he manages to keep a straight face while spitting a rhyme about farts . After the boat ride , Rachel brings her boys ashore where Chris Harrison and a crowd of spectators are waiting . It s time for the Bachelor Nation Spelling Bee ! Tell us how well you re gon na do , Iggy . Yeah , this is gon na be rough . But Rachel , who needs her man to have some smarts , is n t afraid to embarrass these dudes in the name of finding a suitable mate . Adam s up first , and naturally his sidekick is there to cheer him on . The early words are easy enough ( squirt , passion , caress ) , and everyone s doing fine â€¦ until we get to Kenny . Ouch , that one hurts . Especially because it makes Lee so happy . Once Kenny falls , though , the guys start messing up left and right . Iggy tanks on boudoir , Eric gets all but two letters wrong in fa ade â€¦ â€¦ and pretty soon the detention area is all but full . Rachel , does this worry you ? Harrison asks . A little bit , she admits . And it only gets more troublesome when Peter spells coitus with a q. At last it s down to Josiah , Anthony , and Will and if you ask me , the final rounds are rigged . Josiah gets stunning , and Anthony gets boutonniere , a word I have to google every single time I need to write it ? That s some BS . Will is knocked out with physiological , and then Josiah secures the W by properly spelling polyamorous . That night , Rachel kicks off the after party by gently reminding the guys to keep the good energy going . And for a while , they do . Eventually , though , things start going wrong for Josiah . First , he spills on himself : Then , Iggy decides to once again use his alone time with Rachel to trash-talk another guy . Josiah , says Iggy , covers up his insecurities with a false sense of bravado . Hey pal , that s kind of like covering up one s insecurities by badmouthing other people , is n t it ? Iggy goes on to call Josiah the pariah of the group , and informs Rachel he s only telling her this stuff because he s so protective of her . If that s not annoying enough , Iggy returns to the group and promptly announces to Josiah that he just told Rachel that nobody likes him . ( Just as he did with Eric , Iggy lies again , saying it was Rachel who brought up Josiah s name , when we all know that s not how it went down . ) Agreed . ( As for Josiah s claim that Iggy confessed to the guys that he shoots steroids in his nuts ? Let us never speak of it again . ) When it s Lee s turn to sit down with Rachel , he explains to her that Kenny screamed at him because he interrupted his chat with Rachel . He was yelling at me and yelling at me , says Lee . There was a side of him that came out that night that was very aggressive towards me , and I ca n t explain it . He gave me the finger . It was aggressive . The Bachelorette ca n t quite believe that things were as bad as Lee claims , so she decides to get the story from Kenny directly . In the interest of keeping it real , Rachel tells Kenny that she heard him yelling at Lee on rose ceremony night , and it s been bothering her ever since . To Kenny s credit , he admits he did n t handle the situation with Lee well . He was dismissing me at every turn , he tells Rachel . And when you re trying to express an emotional point of view to somebody who you think is your friend and again , I kind of feel like he was baiting me , and I m dumb for even allowing that to happen â€¦ I was ashamed of myself . But Kenny also stands up for himself , reminding Rachel that maybe Lee does n t necessarily tell the truth . If only Kenny had left things there . Despite telling Rachel that he s not , in fact , an aggressive person , Kenny ca n t stop himself from confront Lee yet again . Lee , the guy he knows is baiting him . Lee s a liar , a fabricator he s an alternative facts piece of garbage ! Kenny fumes . And it sucks that someone like that has got me in this spot . You guys , I m beginning to think we re not going to see Jack s one-on-one date tonight . Indeed , Kenny finds Lee at the bar , and puts a hand on his shoulder . Me and you need to have a chat , bro . Lee groans , Oh my God and for once , I m in agreement with him . Lee is an asshat , but Kenny is just playing right into it . The guys watch with nervous anticipation as Kenny and Lee head out to the deck . It looks like there s a fight that s gon na happen , reports Adam . Blood s gon na be shed . It s freaking me the hell out . Hold that thought , pal ! Yes , next week Team Bachelorette will not only give us two episodes ( Monday and Tuesday ) , they ll also bring us the Lee-vs . - Kenny two-on-one date we all knew was coming .

		"paragraph": "Not too long ago , I had dinner with a friend who had just recently entered a relationship . As we talked , she confessed to feeling unsure about her boyfriend and to having dinner solo with a single guy friend the previous night . She d tried to tell him she d recently coupled off but could n t . She did n t know why . Two weeks later , she d broken it off with her boyfriend and was still hanging out with her single guy friend . Meet a new dating term that was born in 2017 : cushioning . To summarize , cushioning basically means having prospects that you keep in touch with , just in case your existing relationship ( or budding relationship ) flames out . The term is seemingly a throwback to a 2014 study on back burners , prospects you communicate with now and then just in case you want to open the door to something romantic or sexual later on . When you re in a relationship , though , how do you think of cushions and back burners ? And perhaps more important , how should you think about them ? I d say most people still have them , even when they are romantically involved . In this 2017 study , the researchers talk about boundary crossing and boundary violation . The former , the milder of the two , is brushing up against the proverbial guardrail of non-cheating behavior , like flirting with a casual friend or ex online . While emotional or physical cheating is a violation , even crossing a line has negative relationship impacts . I ve had a lot of people express confusion to me about the boundary lines in a relationship . What is an emotional affair ? What is cheating ? What lines ca n t I cross ? It s interesting that we often ca n t define emotional cheating , but we re curious about it and there is sooo much are-we-aren t-we behavior . In recent survey of 5,000 Facebook users , nearly half owned up to using social media for emotional engagement with potential romantic flames who were not their current partners . All that said , I want to talk about where the lines should be . What s normal . And what s not . We are all exposed to hundreds of people on social media each day , some of whom we could have seen ourselves dating had the chips ever fallen the right way . Maybe even some people who we might see ourselves dating in the future you know , if our current relationship falls apart . So , intentionality means a lot here , because no one is going to be able to monitor your behavior . In all social media situations , the best strategy is to keep it visible , or imagine that it is if you feel you would n t want your significant other to see whom you re interacting with or how you re interacting , then it s best to refrain . Keep all conversations friendly , not flirty . And notice if your reach-outs are in any way reactive to your relationship s health . Are you not getting enough attention from your partner ? Did you just get into a disagreement ? If you re using social media interaction with back burners to fill a hole or gloss over a problem , then go to the source instead . This is a tricky one , because it s very possible there might be a slight layer of chemistry with certain friends especially , in a classic boundary-touching example , between two heterosexual friends of the opposite sex . However , I am not of the school of thought that two friends of the opposite sex ca n t be friends . If you were friends before your current relationship started , then just be transparent about any meetups you may have with this person and discuss any fears/issues/concerns with your partner . That said , I think timing of the friendship matters . Actively seeking out new friends , who might be potential cushions , while you re in a relationship ventures out into dangerous and potentially boundary-crossing territory . Meeting new friends is something you usually have a lot more time and emotional energy for while you are single . So if you feel the urge to befriend potential back burners while coupled , and you do want to indulge some layer of spark or feeling , ask yourself if your relationship needs a satisfaction check-in before pursuing those sorts of friends . Especially in heterosexual relationships , it s often tempting to get the opposite sex s point of view . I still remember , in my youngest dating days , reaching out to my male best friend for advice on my relationship . ( He was insightful , even if I leaned on him a little too much . ) It s not necessarily bad to ask that opinion of a friend or cushion , but it is bad if you are looking for emotional validation about your opinion on a fight or grievance with a partner . If it s advice about something you want to do for your partner , like a gift around the holidays , that s fairly innocuous and others can be helpful . If it s help about resolving a disagreement , never take it to someone you might consider a cushion or back burner this is definitely brushing up against boundary lines , and a form of emotional intimacy that could damage your existing relationship and break trust . Many partners would n t be cool knowing you ve aired an issue to someone you have that kind of bond with , and true resolution will only happen if you go straight to the source anyway . Avoid , avoid . Sometimes , you break things off with a potential partner due to timing issues . Perhaps one of you moved across the country to pursue a career opportunity , or you both had to work through some growing pains on the road to adulthood . Sometimes , those are sparks that never die and it s easy to get curious about that person later . What are they up to now ? It s also not uncommon for someone who fits the former-flame/sorta-friend bill to cross your path in the future . Maybe they moved back to the area , broke up with an existing partner , or are passing through town . In these situations , where the flame never really burned out completely , you should expect to feel some form of chemistry with them . And even if curiosity is killing you , you should not indulge the urge to check up on or meet up with them . In almost all gray areas , what you feel on the inside has to be the litmus test for engagement if there s some layer of romantic chemistry , even if it s light or long past , then seeking intimacy with that person is a recipe for disaster . It can easily break the trust in a relationship . On top of that , this kind of boundary-brushing behavior , or even the desire for it , is usually the symptom of something bigger perhaps it s an issue you need to address with your partner , or perhaps you need to consider a breakup . Feeling chemistry with someone else and wishing you could pursue it can be a sign you re one foot out the door of your current relationship . At the end of the day , if you would n t divulge to your partner the entirety of your interactions with a back burner , opposite-sex friend , cushion , or what have you , you should n t engage with that person . And if you want a long-term monogamous relationship but feel genuinely tempted to cross some boundary lines , you should do some soul-searching and then consult your existing partner with what you find .

From their first , blackmail-induced meeting at a coffee shop through numerous drunken encounters and the occasional dice-induced antics , the couple have been filled with lust and their mutual fear of intimacy for nearly four years . The first time they met , Sheldon was reluctant to get together with a woman Howard and Raj had found for him through an online dating site , but Raj 's threat of a dirty sock drove him to it . Sheldon is shocked to discover the person he 's meeting is there only because she and her mother had agreed she had to go on one date a year . Amy immediately takes any hope of physical intimacy off the table , which so charms Sheldon that he offers to buy her a beverage . \" Tepid water , \" she replies . \" Good God , what have we done ? \" says Howard , appalled that they 've stumbled upon a female version of Sheldon .

		"paragraph": "New York ( AFP ) - Serena Williams vies for a record-equalling 24th major title at the US Open on Saturday , with Naomi Osaka out to deny her idol and become Japan 's first Grand Slam champion . One of the two will make history on Arthur Ashe Stadium court , where Williams won the first of her six US Open titles at the age of 17 . Osaka was not yet two at the time , and the 20-year-old admits it 's \" surreal \" to think she 'll be taking on the woman who inspired her tennis career in her very first Grand Slam final . \" I always dreamed that I would play Serena in a final of a Grand Slam , \" Osaka said . The youngest woman to reach a US Open final since 2009 , Osaka displayed poise and mental fortitude in saving all 13 break points she faced in a semi-final victory over American Madison Keys . Her powerful ground game has carried her to the final with the loss of just one set , her infectious enthusiasm for the peculiar challenges of the US Open earning her a legion of fans along the way . \" I like to sweat , \" Osaka declared of the punishing heat and humidity that has brought bigger names to their knees . And she will against Williams , who is vintage form as she chases her first Grand Slam title since the birth of her daughter Olympia on September 1 2017 . One year ago at this time , Williams was in the midst of four post-natal surgeries . After coming tantalizingly close to equalling Australian Margaret Court 's record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles with a runner-up finish at Wimbledon , Williams says the milestone is n't her main focus . \" I 'm just going to keep trying , \" she said . \" If it does n't happen , I 'll keep trying for the next one . \" That 's not the only record in Williams 's sights on Saturday . With a seventh US Open title to go with those she won in 1999 , 2002 , 2008 , 2012 , 2013 and 2014 she can break out of a tie with Chris Evert for the most ever . Williams says it 's hard to gauge just how close she is to her dominant best , but there 's no question she 's playing far and away above her number 26 world ranking and even the 17th seeding granted by US Open officials . She leads the tournament with 64 aces and has been broken just six times in six matches while Osaka has dropped her serve just four times . The numbers promise a scintillating match up , if the magnitude of the occasion does n't prove too much for the young Japanese . \" I feel like even though I should enjoy this moment , I should still think of it as another match , \" she said . \" I should n't really think of her as my idol . I should just try to play her as an opponent . \" Williams is n't worried that their only prior meeting , at Miami in March , was a victory for Osaka . \" It was good that I played her because I kind of know how she plays now , \" Williams said . \" I mean , I was breast-feeding at the time , so it was a totally different situation . \" I have nothing to lose , \" added Williams , who can join Australians Court , Evonne Goolagong and Belgian Kim Clijsters as the only mothers to win a Grand Slam singles title . \" I 'm going to go out there and do what I can . \" Osaka , meanwhile , will do everything she can to bring the match-up to the conclusion of her youthful dream . \" I do n't dream to lose , \" she said .",

		"paragraph": "When it comes to this year s Emmy nominees , it was a very good year to be either a kid , an old pro , or a political satirist . Netflix s Stranger Things ( the story of a gaggle of youths confronting the supernatural ) and FX s Feud : Bette and Joan ( the tale of the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ) were among the newcomers which racked up the most nominations . Other new shows that did well ? This Is Us , Atlanta , and The Crown . NBC should thank its lucky stars that it has one of the most popular new shows ( This Is Us ) and one of the most popular old shows ( Saturday Night Live ) on the air . At a time when the broadcast networks are frequently locked out of any acclaim in this Platinum Age of quality TV , This Is Us scored a best-drama nod as well as numerous acting nominations , while SNL benefited mightily from the drama of Donald Trump , with nominations for Alec Baldwin ( for his Trump ) , Melissa McCarthy ( Sean Spicer ) , and Kate McKinnon ( Hillary Clinton ) , as well as Vanessa Bayer and Leslie Jones in the Supporting Actress in a Comedy category . Among talk shows , The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , and Real Time with Bill Maher were joined by the equally partisan newcomer Full Frontal with Samantha Bee in the Variety/Talk Series list . ( Sorry , Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers , and by now I almost feel sympathy for the benighted , apolitical Jimmy Fallon . ) I was super pleased to see Donald Glover s Atlanta get nominations for best comedy and best actor . I wish his co-star , Brian Tyree Henry , had also been recognized for this show , but Henry did score a nom for his guest work in This Is Us . Indeed , This Is Us is the gift that keeps on giving for its network ( NBC is now the first broadcast network since CBS in 2011 , forThe Good Wife to get major-category drama nominations ) and for its actors : Much of its large cast was nominated in lead and supporting categories . A couple of days ago , I correctly predicted some big Emmy love for Big Little Lies , Feud , Stranger Things , and Atlanta . But where did I go wrong ? Chiefly in thinking that Issa Rae s Insecure comedy on HBO would be an Emmy breakout , and in hoping that FX s Legion would score some recognition for its acting . Certainly the absence of Game of Thrones as an eligible show opened up a some doors for HBO s other big fantasy series , rookie Westworld . The best surprises for me were seeing Bill Camp get a nomination for his world-weary cop in HBO s The Night Of ( that miniseries did very well , with multiple nods ) , and Pamela Adlon for the FX comedy she co-created with Louis CK , Better Things . Stepping back and taking the long view , this year s Emmy nominations have upped the percentage of nonwhite performers to a gratifying degree . And while the overall list of nominees contains some repetitions from years past did both Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin really merit more Grace and Frankie nominations ? there is clearly an openness to new shows that expand the vocabulary of their genres ( Atlanta , Master of None , and Handmaid s Tale ) that is truly heartening . I m looking forward to cheering on many of these nominees and to seeing Stephen Colbert host these awards . The 69th Annual Emmy Awards will air Sunday , Sept. 17 , at 8 p.m. on CBS .

		"paragraph": "Teenagers have always done dumb things . And now that just about all of them are outfitted with cell phones featuring cameras , we re reminded of as much just about daily . [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] And , because teenagers are capable of being good NBA players , they will ( rightfully ) earn employment in this league . As a result , the league and its older players will have to sit through the same sort of growing pains that come from having to mind a kid that is about to turn 19 into 20 . A report from ESPN early on Wednesday reminded us of that . Allegedly , newly turned-20 Lakers rookie D Angelo Russell reportedly filmed a conversation with teammate Nick Young , who is famously engaged to rapper Iggy Azalea , without Young s knowledge . The clip somehow found its way online recently , and as a result Russell has become a bit of a pariah inside the Lakers ' locker room . From Marc Stein and Baxter Holmes : All of this comes toward the end of the Lakers literal and figurative Worst Season Ever , the most recent example of such coming in the team s embarrassing 48-point blowout loss to the Utah Jazz on Monday . A breach of Bro Trust does n t excuse the squad s insistence on playing wow , really â€¦ and you get paid for this ? - defense in Salt Lake City ( Young sat out the game due to a stomach ailment ) , but our reaction to that malaise was truly telling . It s true that the one-sided scoreboard in Utah on Monday could have been expected the Lakers are the worst team in the West , while the Jazz are a current playoff team just starting to turn into gear . Outside of the lopsided score , though , nothing seemed all that shocking : Los Angeles does not care about defense , and in handing the reins over to a skinflint front office , coach Byron Scott , while making Kobe Bryant the NBA s highest-paid player ( to say nothing of employing Nick Young s shot selection ) , little seemed awry . The saddest part is that the record-setting loss seemed so normal . This is n t to excuse Nick Young s public shaming , though , nor D Angelo Russell s work , and what Young s fianc e now has to unfortunately answer for : Alec Nathan at Bleacher Report reminded us of this quote culled from Byron Scott earlier in the year : That s pretty much how things work with all 19-year-olds , and most 20-year-olds . Russell turned 20 in February , but that s hardly a demarcation point . Just because someone that age can afford the finest dry-aged cuts , it does n t mean they re going to choose it over chicken fingers and two tubs of ranch dressing . Just because the bank account is full , it does n t mean they know how to endorse that check . Just because a dress code is required upon entering the arena , it does n t mean life is n t spent in a series of hoodies and sweats . Which is absolutely fine enjoy it while you can . And , given the opportunity to be cheeky , kids are going to go for it . And D Angelo Russell is still kid , and all the kids have phones with really , really good cameras in them . D Angelo Russell did n t deserve this sort of professional setting in his rookie year , Nick Young did n t deserve being set up , Iggy Azalea certainly does n t deserve having to answer for her fianc e s alleged wandering eye , and Lakers fans ( even after years of long playoff trips into June ) do n t deserve this sort of Scott and Bryant-led season . It s been a waste . What we re just hoping is that any of this can be teachable . - - - - - - - Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "Weight-Loss Win is an original Yahoo series that shares the inspiring stories of people who have shed pounds healthfully . Daniel Shuman is 30 years old , 5 feet 10 inches tall , and currently weighs 184 pounds . In 2017 , after the birth of his second child , he realized he needed to change his lifestyle for the future of his family . This is the story of his weight-loss journey . The turning point I ve struggled with my weight my entire life . One recent low point was when , a few years ago , my family took a trip to Orlando . I was extremely excited to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios , and to go on the rides . However , my excitement turned to shame , as I was kicked off the ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey because I could not fit in the seat safely . My weight was a constant battle . Not a day went by that I did n t hate my body and fear for my health . However , last September my second son was born . I feared that if I continued on the same path , there was a strong chance that I would be prematurely leaving my children without a father , and my wife without a husband . Last Passover while visiting my parents , I watched the documentary Fed Up , which discusses obesity in the United States , and how we are losing a daily battle within a system in which we are designed to fail . Things such as processed foods and refined sugars make maintaining a healthy lifestyle extremely difficult for many Americans . I learned that these foods are almost inescapable , especially if you do not have the proper understanding of how these things are added into our food surreptitiously . I learned that we become addicted to these things at a young age . I was especially upset to learn that the formula that I had fed my boys had processed sugars added to it . It was at that time that I became angry and decided to take action . The changes I began by eliminating processed foods and refined sugars from my diet . I immediately saw results . I read Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman , and finally found what I was looking for a plan of the healthiest food you can eat , backed up by science and peer-reviewed studies . I used the book to design a diet that worked for me and my lifestyle , and the weight began falling off . At the same time , I began walking . My stamina was poor , but I began incrementally , and gradually found ways to add physical activity into my life . I tried to do it in a way where I could experience nature and simultaneously engage in physical activity . I eventually acquired a beach cruiser bicycle to ride on the Rockaway Beach boardwalk . Slowly but surely , my stamina increased and I was able to increase the length of my rides . I found that I loved being outdoors , especially near the ocean . Eventually , a good friend gave me a multigeared hybrid bicycle and I was able to ride faster and longer . Once winter arrived and I could no longer tolerate the cold , I joined a gym and began walking and jogging on the treadmill . I was also able to incorporate some weight training . I purchased a pull-up bar and a kettlebell and began doing different exercises I found online . I m about to begin the last week of the Couch to 5K program , and can already run over 3 miles without stopping . At this point last year , simply getting dressed could leave me winded . For me , the biggest motivation was success . Once I experienced a little success and saw the weight begin to drop , I felt completely empowered and motivated to keep the momentum going . The next and almost equally important factor was the support I received from my loved ones as well as support from complete strangers . My wife , family , and friends could not have been more supportive . That part did n t surprise me . I m lucky to have a wife who has always loved me for who I am , despite my weight . She chose to adopt this lifestyle as well , even though her issues with weight were relatively minor . What did surprise me was the support I received from complete strangers . Almost every time I was out , someone would see me and give me encouragement , and as the weight loss began to be more noticeable , I was getting approached by neighbors and strangers who were always interested to hear my story . The after I feel incredible . I think it s important to not view my journey as complete , as this is something I need to remain vigilant about . It would break my heart to go back to the old me . I am more active and am truly empowered . My emotional state has dramatically improved as well . I am more present with my family , and this state of mind has had a positive affect on my professional life as well . My journey was full of surprises . First , I was surprised at the level of deceit present in the food industry . One example is cooking spray . Cooking spray is sold as a fat free food . However , cooking spray is essentially all fat ( it s oil that sprays nicely ) . There is a loophole in which if the serving size is small enough and the fat content is below a certain level , manufacturers are allowed to market it as fat free . The serving size for cooking spray is essentially the equivalent of spraying just one-third of a second . I challenge you to try to spray cooking oil on a pan for one-third of a second . I was also surprised at how easy it became to maintain my lifestyle once the switch was flipped , so to speak . The maintenance During the week , I eat little to no animal protein ( meat , dairy , fish ) , no processed foods , no refined sugars , and little to no oil . On the weekends , I still indulge in minimal amounts of lean animal proteins . When I do consume meat , it is not the main component of my meal but is added primarily for flavoring . As Dr. Fuhrman says , Salad ( or some form of it ) is the main dish . I try to exercise each and every day . In the past , exercise was a chore . Now it s something I look forward to . One of the the most important parts of maintaining my lifestyle is making sure I have a lot of healthy options . Planning my weekly menus and shopping on Sundays has made maintaining this lifestyle an attainable goal . If I maintain a healthy diet and remain satiated , half the battle is already won . My wife and children inspire me to keep going . I love that I can keep up with my 5 - year-old . I love that I no longer overhear children whispering to their parents in the store , That man is fat , Mommy . I love that I can be a better husband , father , and friend . In the past , my life was defined by limits almost everywhere I went . No more . The struggles I still struggle with cravings , especially at night . If I am surrounded by unhealthy food , there s a strong chance I will eat it . The biggest thing is to just keep going . I view slip-ups not as cheats , but indulgences . In the past , a bad food day would cause me to give up . Now if I have a bad day , I try to make sure to make it right the next day . Advice Keep at it . You can do it . Educate yourself about the science of food and which foods are best for you . Do your homework . Find ways to be active in ways you find enjoyable .

		"paragraph": "The US government has said it will impose fresh sanctions on Russia after determining it used a nerve agent in the attack against a former Russian spy in Salisbury . The State Department said the sanctions will be imposed on Moscow because it used a chemical weapon in violation of international law in the attack on former Russian spy , Sergei Skripal , 67 , and his daughter Yulia , 33 . The pair were poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent called novichok in Salisbury , UK , in March . Following a 15-day Congressional notification period , the new US sanctions will take effect on or around 22 August , according to a statement . Downing Street and the Foreign Office both welcomed the move . The UK welcomes this further action by our US allies . The strong international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message to Russia that its provocative , reckless behaviour will not go unchallenged , a spokesman said . Three months after the attack , Dawn Sturgess , who lived in a city nearby and had no ties to Russia , died from exposure to the nerve agent . The mother-of-three had fallen ill on 30 June and passed away at Salisbury District Hospital . Her death is being investigated as murder . Her partner Chris Rowley , who was also exposed to the novichok , was released from hospital in late-July . Police believe the couple accidentally found a bottle containing novichok . State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said it had been determined Russia had used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law , or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals . Following the use of a Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to assassinate UK citizen Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal , the United States , on 6 August , 2018 , determined under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 ( CBW Act ) that the government of the Russian Federation has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals , a statement said . The sanctions will cover sensitive national security goods , a senior State Department official said . There would , however , be exemptions for space flight activities and areas covering commercial passenger aviation safety , which would be allowed on a case by case basis , the official added . A second batch of more draconian sanctions would be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gives reliable assurances that it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations . If those criteria are not met it is up to Russia to make that decision a second round of sanctions ... will to be imposed , the official said , They are in general more draconian than the first round . UK Prime Minister Theresa May had been quick and unwavering in her assessment of Russia s role in using the nerve agent in the Salisbury incident . She called it a brazen act , expelled 23 Russian diplomats , and cut high-level contact with Moscow . We consider this hostile action as totally unacceptable , unjustified and shortsighted , the Russian Embassy to the UK said in a statement , which denied any claims of an attempted assassination of the Skirpals , adding that all the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-UK relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain . Even former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been fast to call it a really egregious act that appears to have clearly come from Russia . He had called President Vladimir Putin â€˜ s country an irresponsible force of instability in the world , acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens . Mr Tillerson even went as far as saying the poisoning certainly will trigger a response from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( Nato ) . I ll leave it at that , he said . However , Mr Trump s initial comments were more cautious . He said on Tuesday that as soon as we get the facts straight , if we agree with them , we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be . There was not an official condemnation from the US over the attack until the State Department s notice of sanctions today . In the wake of Ms May s accusation and expulsion of several Russian diplomats from the UK , Moscow responded in kind . That same month , Mr Trump expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the US . However , while it had expelled diplomats the US had had yet to make the formal determination that the Russian government had used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals . Several members of Congress had expressed concern that the Trump administration was dragging its feet on the determination and had missed a deadline to publish its findings .

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK ( AP ) President Donald Trump made no mention in his financial disclosure report Wednesday of a $ 130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about an alleged affair , but said in a footnote that he \" fully reimbursed \" his personal attorney for as much $ 250,000 for unspecified \" expenses . \" The head of the nation 's ethics office questioned why Trump did n't include this in last year 's disclosure and passed along his concerns to federal prosecutors . \" I am providing both reports to you because you may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing , \" Office of Government Ethics Acting Director David Apol wrote to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . Apol wrote that he considers Trump 's payment to Cohen as a payment on a loan , and that it was required to be disclosed in Trump 's June 2017 disclosure . Ethics experts said that if that money was a loan and knowingly and willfully not disclosed , Trump could be in violation of ethics laws , a violation for which others have been prosecuted . \" This is a big deal and unprecedented . No President has been previously subject to any referral by ( Office of Government Ethics ) to DOJ as a result of having failed to report an item on their public financial disclosure report , \" said Virginia Canter , a former ethics official in the Clinton and Obama White Houses who is now with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington . How Trump dealt with the Stormy Daniels payment in his disclosure has been closely watched , particularly after his attorney Rudy Giuliani gave interviews earlier this month saying the president had repaid Cohen , a payment that had not shown up in Trump 's report last year . In a footnote in tiny type on page 45 of his 92-page disclosure , Trump said he reimbursed Cohen for \" expenses \" ranging from $ 100,001 to $ 250,000 . The report said the president did not have to disclose the payment but was doing so \" in the interest of transparency . \" Daniels ' lawyer Michael Avenatti tweeted , \" Mr. Trump 's disclosure today conclusively proves that the American people were deceived . \" ... \" This was NOT an accident and it was not isolated . Cover-ups should always matter . \" The footnote appears in a report giving the first extended look at Trump 's income from his properties since he became president . The report shows he took in $ 75 million from his Miami golf course and resort last year , $ 25 million at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and $ 15 million from his golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey . All those 12-month figures are down from the president 's previous report , but that earlier one covered about 14 months so it is not comparable . When Trump took office , he refused to fully divest from his global business , instead putting his assets in a trust controlled by his two sons and a senior executive . Trump can take back control of the trust at any time and he 's allowed to withdraw cash from it as he pleases . Abdollah reported from Washington . AP writer Richard Lardner contributed from Washington .",

The world exhaled , for one of the great unresolved questions of television history had finally been answered . But hold the phone , Sil .

		"paragraph": "Tuesday on Discovery s Shark Week is all about sharks and the city : At 9 p.m. , Sharks and the City : Los Angeles sets out to uncover why a record number of great whites are being sighted in Southern California , while Sharks and the City : New York ( 10 p.m. ) , narrated by Chris Noth , explores the reasons the New York Bight could one day become a new great white hot spot . Here s a preview . Sharks and the City : Los Angeles For 30 years , Chris Lowe , director of the CSULB Shark Lab Right , has lived and worked in California . He never thought he d see the day when he d be able to go out and tag baby white sharks in his front yard . But he knows the increased numbers that have been amazing for him have also been startling to the public . Sharing the information his team is learning , he hopes , will help change perspectives . I think it s a good thing , he says , and people always look at you odd when you say that . â€¦ This is something that I do n t think many people expected because we hear bad news all the time about the environment , overfishing , and things like that . They re not used to somebody coming and saying , â€˜ Guess what . These things are coming back . So I think that s an important part for people to see that conservation can work . It s also important , he believes , for people to see how the science is done and why answers take time . In this hour , the investigation leads him to Guadalupe , Mexico , where a growing seal population is bringing in more great whites . They re seeing more and more juveniles than they ve ever seen before , and that s an interesting part of the puzzle . Historically , they only have seen big animals out there , that s typically what you see at these aggregation sites . And when smaller animals start showing up , things are getting a little crowded , Lowe says . It s kind of like going to a barbecue and having it open and seeing who shows up . You start to see people competing for ribs that may be coming out . You see how sharks react around each other in that case . The reality of it is that s kind of a dangerous place for those younger animals to be , because if you get in some big white shark s way , there s a good chance you re going to get scolded . And a scolding from a big white shark could really be the end . As you see in the video above , the team observed how larger , older sharks intimidate the smaller , younger ones with parallel swimming ( after sizing one another up , the smaller shark gives way ) and gaping ( the larger shark repeatedly opens and closes its mouth as a warning ) . It s Lowe s hypothesis that the smaller sharks that ca n t compete for food at Guadalupe are the ones heading up to L.A. Those 9 - and 10-foot size sharks are the ones that they see occasionally out at Guadalupe , and they re the ones being pushed out . Everybody s gon na defend their plate full of ribs , and they do n t want these youngsters coming in and trying to steal their food . So those youngsters have to find new places to hunt , and Southern California may be the best place because our marine mammal populations , especially on the offshore islands , have just shot up , Lowe says . So if I was a white shark and I was looking for a new barbecue place , Southern California would be it for me . While he still needs to tag sharks around the Channel Islands to help confirm his theory , he wants to reiterate this message : Just because there are more sharks , that does n t mean people are at greater risk . What it does remind us is that it s their home . We ve spent a lot of time and money bringing them back . We pretty much got rid of all the big predators 50 years ago . And we re now just starting to get used to how to act around them , whether it be seals , sea lions , dolphins , whales , or sharks , it does n t matter they re all wild animals . They can all be potentially dangerous . But we have to recognize that we re kind of guests in their home , and we have to learn how to behave that way . His best advice : The safest place to be is at the most popular beach . The reason why I say that is because it s rare for people to be bitten at really popular beaches . My best guess is that sharks avoid those places . People are loud or smelly we chase away all their favorite food , he says . If you re not at a popular beach , the next safest thing to do is stay in a group . Surfers that are bitten are most often by themselves , and if you re in a small group , that reduces your chances . It you re an ocean swimmer , swim in a group , swim with friends . Statistically , that s what the numbers are telling us . Sharks and the City : New York You ve never seen anyone more excited on Shark Week than marine biologist Craig O Connell when his camera traps capture footage of a great white taking bait off Montauk , Long Island . The goal was just to see a white shark , but I knew from doing about five years of research prior to that , that seeing a white shark was a very tough task . I caught one white shark over the span of five years , and so I knew that having to do it while a camera was there would be near impossible , he says . The way it works is you look at all the footage at the end of the day . We saw that silhouette of a white shark , and we just lost our mind because of the amount of work that we put in just to get that moment . It was part of something much bigger . To me , that is what the exciting part was we proved at last that they re there , and that they re there quite frequently . The next step is to continue doing the work and find out why they re here , what they re feeding on . We need to learn as much about these animals as possible so we can continue to protect them . It s another conservation success story : the water of the New York Bight , which runs from Montauk to Cape May , N.J. , is cleaner , which leads to the presence of more prey , like seals , which have been protected since the 70s . I ve actually lived in New York my whole life , and I ve never seen a seal until we were filming this episode and we go to this one site and see 20 of them just hanging out . That s a direct correlation with the fact that we re protecting these animals , O Connell says . He looks at what s happening in Cape Cod , where a colony of 20,000 seals has brought big white sharks into the area , or in Cape Town , South Africa , which has a famous population of 60,000 around Dyer Island . I ve spoke to a lot of seal researchers who ve said that it s quite possible that some of the seals can start residing in New York waters over the summer , he says . If that s the case , we could potentially see some of the larger white sharks here too , because that s what these large white sharks are feeding on . New York is n t quite at the point where South Africa is at , but it could be one day if we continue to do all the right things . For now , it s white pups that are frequenting the waters . O Connell identified nine in Montauk , catching one and bringing it on board to tag it ( another enthusiastic sequence ) . What he learned : these young whites are swimming down to Coney Island . That s the thing that I think is very intriguing about the whole episode , is that we reveal where these animals are going . They re going to places where there s a lot of people going into the water every day , and they re not bothering the people , he says . It s important that people recognize that if they did go in the water in Montauk , or Coney Island , or Jones Beach , they ve most likely already been in the water with these animals . And the fact that they came out unscathed should be a direct indication to them that we re not on these sharks menu . We need to respect the fact that it s the shark s environment and the fact that the sharks are there is a sign that the environment is getting healthier . So it s a very good thing . If you get to see one , embrace the sighting . You should feel privileged that you got to see it . Be happy and consider yourself lucky . Shark Week continues through July 30 on Discovery .

		"paragraph": "KISS got a really bad review in 1974 , and Gene Simmons is still not over it . The outspoken singer and bass player , 68 , from the iconic heavy metal and heavily made up glam rock band has once again shared a terrible review the group got more than four decades ago . Clearly still irked but also inspired by it , he wrote , 44 Years Ago !!! The review is from the Seattle Daily Times and is pretty brutal : I hope the four guys who make up the group , whose names do n t matter , are putting money away for the future . The near future , because KISS wo n t be around long . You ca n t see the author s name or any other unkind remarks from the story , but according to the website Ultimate Classic Rock , it was written by Patrick MacDonald about the group s May 25 , 1974 , stop at the Paramount Northwest , a Seattle venue . It also called KISS a very flashy glitter band that tries to make up in theatrics what it lacks musically and said the songs are strictly on the moron level â€¦ made up of a series of simple chords any child could learn and lyrics that are there because they rhyme . Ouch . Clearly this review stuck with the star , who has shared it at least once before . Ultimate Classic Rock also reported that KISS actually put the putting money away quote on some of their fan merchandise from their 2000 farewell tour . So not only are they getting the last laugh , but also they re making money off of the bad review . In fact , a tee cost $ 30 , and they re still available . So whatever became of MacDonald ? While we like to think that he rocks a T-shirt with his review on it now and then , we do know that he retired in 2008 after 35 years as the Seattle Times music critic and 46 years of covering music in Seattle . In his parting column , he signed off with a KISS quote , of all things : What am I going to do now ? Well , of course , I m going to rock n roll all night and party every day ! Simmons s 44-year obsession with this bad review serves as a reminder , though , that the brash rocker holds a grudge , which comes as no surprise to many in ( and out of ) the biz .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This interview for The Big Scary U episode of The Walking Dead contains storyline and character spoilers . Negan backstory , Rick and Daryl throwing down , a sick Gabriel , a suspicious Eugene , a live helicopter , and a hint at the return of the Heapsters â€¦ The Big Scary U had all that and more . And one of our favorite members of The Walking Dead crew , co-executive producer Denise Huth , broke it all down for Yahoo Entertainment . This is a very packed episode . I love that we re getting these backstories , parallel stories this season , with the larger stories . Like in this episode , where we find out why Negan and Dwight and Eugene and Gavin were gathered right inside the Sanctuary when Rick and his team arrived in the season premiere . Is that how it will continue to play out through the first half of the season ? Yeah , absolutely . It s been really interesting this season with the amount of time that passes over the course of these episodes . This is episode 5 , but it s still the same day as the initial attack from ( the premiere ) . Episodes 1 through 5 are the same day . So , we have a lot of characters and stories to check in on . Once they split up there at the Sanctuary , they all went off to different stories , and , of course , we left Gabriel and Negan trapped in that trailer . So , I love this episode as well , because we ve had so much action the first four episodes , and we still certainly have action in this episode with Rick and Daryl , but we re able to go back in time a little bit , and see what was going on at the Sanctuary before the attack , and find out what happened there after their attack . We also get the first major piece of very specific backstory from Negan , when he tells Gabriel about his first and , as he puts it , his only , real wife . This is the most genuine , non-swaggering we ve seen Negan so far . It s a great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan , and it s powerful when we get that piece of information from him in this circumstance . Yeah , it was really fun to see that side of Negan , because we have n t seen it before , and that little piece [ of info ] that Gabriel was able to get from him , it tells us a lot about him . It tells us a lot about how he was before he got to this point . It is nice to see that moment of real honesty from him because everything is a bit of a show with Negan . He does like to put on the show , and even in the conversation with Gabriel in that trailer , every question Gabriel asked him â€¦ he s always sort of evading the point and dismissing Gabriel s questions , but in the end , when he knows they ve got to get out of there , and the trailer is not going to hold , and they re better off together than trying to do it alone , he actually is able to get very honest and give Gabriel a little bit of truth that he probably has n t given anybody else in his life for a very long time . So , it is a very powerful moment . And he reveals a lot more , in less direct ways . We re getting a bit of the reasoning behind why Negan leads the way he does he says to Gabriel that people will die if he s not there . That might seem like simply arrogance on his part , but by the time the whole episode has played out , we see how that could be true . He tells Gabriel he s going to wait for a bit in the trailer to see if his people can pull things together , which suggests that he knows there s a good chance some sort of chaotic situation will result from his absence , which happens . Yeah , it s really interesting to see both sides . We definitely get Negan s perception of what will happen when he s not there , and then we do see the reality . We see that the lieutenants are caught off guard . They certainly were not expecting this attack , and they do not know where Negan is , and they wonder if he s even alive . They re not comfortable . They do n t have a plan , and you certainly see how when people are angry and scared , how quickly things can fall apart . Negan , I think , certainly has a sense of brutality in the way he does things , but he also does provide order , and that is something people need when they re under great stress and when they [ have ] great fear . And he provides a strict order for how the Sanctuary operates . When there s a question of whether he s still there , you see the lieutenants kind of scramble and fall apart . You see the workers starting to rebel . I do n t think the workers of the Sanctuary are necessarily all that happy generally , but they have been relatively safe in the grand scheme of things , and so to see the walkers surrounding the Sanctuary , and Negan s not there leading everybody , you get the sense that they are moments away from complete and total chaos . And in that regard , Negan is n t wrong . He is capable of keeping people alive , and his whole speech at the very beginning , when he s talking to Gregory about , We save people . That s what we do , he believes that . He s not above killing , obviously , but his intent in his mind is to save people . Negan and Gabriel made for such a great pairing , and it was fun to see what they brought out in each other . Gabriel was n t afraid of Negan . And Negan opened up to Gabriel in a way that he has n t with anyone else . Why do you think there was this chemistry between them ? They were in an extreme situation , and it s one of those things that [ showrunner ] Scott [ Gimple ] and the writers do that I always love , when they take an unpredictable pairing of people and put them in a situation where they have to deal with each other . These are two characters who have n t really spent much time together at all , and obviously there s a great deal of built-in mistrust there . They re trapped in this situation , and how are they going to get out of it ? Gabriel , he s so smart , because I do n t think he is afraid of Negan . He says in the beginning what he fears is a fruitless death , and if he s going to be there with Negan , even if he ultimately were to die in that trailer with Negan , as long as it s for a reason , and as long as he can do something to help his group , he would be OK with that . And that does make him very brave . I think they re such phenomenal actors . Seth Gilliam is just amazing , and Jeffrey , of course , who s always had so much dialogue and stuff , and so much to say , and to be able to crack him open a little bit and see a different side of him , and have these two characters who have spoken two sentences to each other prior to this on the show , spend the bulk of an episode peeling away at each other â€¦ it is really exciting to watch that , and to see the chess game unfold between the two of them as they were trapped in that trailer . That s kind of a theme of this episode , these great pairings . We also get more time with the strange friendship , frienemyship , that s always so fun between Gregory and Simon . But that also leads to some friction between Simon and Negan , the first time we ve seen that fracture in their relationship . Is there maybe more story there ? Is Simon perhaps that hapless previous leader of the Saviors that Negan mentions to Gregory ? You know , I think we ll definitely see a lot more this season of the relationship between Negan and Simon . These two characters have obviously known each other . They had a history that we do n t know . Simon was one of the very first Saviors we ever saw , back at the end of Season 6 . He definitely has a history with Negan , and we see a piece of that . Simon seems very prepared to take out everybody at the Hilltop if he has to , and Negan has a very violent reaction to that . You do get the sense with that moment , and then combined with Negan saying , If I m not in there to save them , people will die , that perhaps there is a little bit of disagreement between Negan and Simon as to how situations like this should be handled . I think it will be interesting to see how that whole dynamic unfolds between the two of them , especially since they re in this extreme pressure cooker , attacked by Rick and our group in a way that they ve never been attacked before . They are caught off guard . I think Negan and the Saviors are used to this kind of rolling and laying down , people just roll over , and Rick has changed that game quite a bit . So , they re back on their heels a little bit , and how Negan reacts and how Simon reacts may not entirely be the same reaction . There s also Eugene and Dwight , who were doing a little dance with each other . Eugene s clearly trying to suss out some information on Dwight when he visits him . Dwight s trying to play it very cool . Both of them know that they ve played against Negan in some ways , but when Eugene sees that bag with the red mark on it , and he knows that it probably came from Dwight s chess piece paint , he also knows though that he s got red paint on his thumb , and that he s going to be the first suspect if anybody notices that . So , do those two guys need to form an alliance right away , or is that too risky for either of them ? I think it comes down to , these two characters are not necessarily on the same side at this point . Dwight , we know , is trying to help Rick and the Alexandria/Hilltop/Kingdom group , but Eugene is always more questionable as to which way the wind is blowing . The reality with Eugene is , he s out to keep himself alive , and we ve seen it time and again with him that he s going to do whatever he has to do in order to survive . I think he is in a very vulnerable position , because everyone within the Sanctuary will assume he is the rat , just based on where he came from , and I do n t think anybody s really looking at Dwight as that possibility , but Eugene is figuring it out . It s going to be a trick of what Eugene does with that information , and how he reacts to it because I do n t think it s black and white . There s a lot of ways Eugene could go with this , so it ll be interesting to see how he ultimately handles those new pieces of information . The other big pairing of the episode finds Rick and Daryl , the last duo we ever would ve thought to see rumbling with each other , getting into this physical fight . Daryl is so full of anger right now , and a desire for vengeance . Is that motivated mostly by his guilt about Glenn ? Is it his memory of the torture he suffered at the Sanctuary ? Or is he feeling a little bit resentful about Rick s plans , and how they have not yet led to Negan s death , or the dismantling of the Saviors ? You know , I really think it s all of those things for Daryl . He does have a lot of history with Negan and with Dwight , and what happened with Glenn . I think all these things are playing into it . I think a lot of it is just frustration . He wants to just go in and kill Negan . That s his only objective , and Rick does have a plan , and the plan is working . From everything we ve seen , the plan is working , but I think it s very difficult to be patient when you have that much vengeance inside of you . So , for him and Rick , these are two characters we have n t seen fight in a very long time . Probably the last time we saw them fight was Season 1 , and there s a really nice callback in there at the end of the episode when Rick says to Daryl , Chokehold s illegal , a ** hole â€¦ it was such a fun callback for the fans [ to when Daryl said that to Shane in Tell It to the Frogs ] . But I think that they re brothers , and I do n t see this being a major divide that will last between them . There s definitely a little bit of frustration with how things are going , and how this plan is proceeding , and I think Daryl s just a little bit more anxious to just go in and finish the job , and Rick wants to continue with the plan that they laid out . So they fight , and they manage to blow up the guns . It does n t work out . They do n t get the end result that they wanted because they could n t agree . It was a fun moment to shoot . It was fun for [ Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln ] to get to do that , but it s also â€¦ of course they would be frustrated . The amount of pressure they re under , and hearing about what happened with the Kingdom group , and knowing that while they are sticking to the plan , they suffered a massive , massive loss among their ranks . That s tough . They know going in they re going to lose people , but when it actually happens , and when it actually happens with that large a number of people , I think it would unsettle anyone , including Rick and Daryl . Especially when , at first , they hear everyone from the Hilltop was killed , which would include Carol . I love the little moment when they hear short-haired psycho woman , and they both know Carol is alive . Yeah , they share that little look when [ Yago ] says , the short-haired , psycho woman , or whatever the exact line was . But , yeah , they re like , Oh , that s our psycho , short-haired lady . Everybody knows who that is , which is an awesome thing . Rick , while he s walking , hears , then sees a helicopter flying above him . He s out in the heat . He probably has n t had a lot of food or water . Is he imagining this , or is this a real helicopter ? You know , there s definitely a helicopter there . He sees it , he hears it , and it s one of those things that , when I got the script , I was like , What ?! It s a helicopter ! He saw one back in the pilot . There was a helicopter we saw , and we never really got the whole story on that one . Again , I think Scott s doing a lot of callbacks this season in honor of it being the season of our hundredth episode , and this war , and the culmination of so much story that s been set up . We ll see where that goes , but , yeah , the helicopter is a pretty exciting little thing there . That could mean all sorts of things . While Rick s walking , a man is on lookout duty and spots him . That guy looks like a Heapster â€¦ I think we know that that s a Heapster . I think we know that , yeah , Rick s walking in that direction . And then at the end , we see Gabriel in the Sanctuary cell â€¦ first of all , Eugene , while knocking on the door , adds another entry on the list of Eugene classics , when he tells Gabriel they re bonded together for life because they both ate dog . They ate dog , yeah ! That was another one of Eugene s moments that I just laughed because it was so perfect . Again , it s a callback to a moment from a few seasons ago . Everyone will remember it , and it s such Eugene logic that , maybe we re not friends , but we did share this experience â€¦ it s just such a Eugene thing to say . More seriously though , of course , Gabriel does look very , very sick . Do we think he s maybe been bitten when he and Negan were trying to make their way through that walker pack ? Or , as Negan described in a much more colorful and graphic way , the stewed walker guts maybe made Gabriel sick ? I think we ll have to wait to see exactly what s making him sick , and how it s all played out , but Negan has a very good point there . It s not something we ve really shown a lot in the past , but that would have to be risky to put dead , rotting guts on your body . It s an effective tool , and we ve used it multiple times in the story , but there has to eventually be a price for that . So , we ll see more with Gabriel , but he is definitely very sick . What can you tease about the next episode , which is already episode 6 , so just two more to go after that for the first half of the season . It s another stunning episode . We get to catch up with a lot of stories that we ve established , and catch up with a few people we have n t seen . We will see Carl , and we ll see Michonne â€¦ it s one of those episodes where we get to check in with a lot of different characters , and find out where they re at on this very , very long day . It s another exciting , action-packed episode of the war . The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : â€˜ The Walking Dead recap : Heeeeere s Negan !

		"paragraph": "Getty Images Chinese stocks , while hardly the under-covered investment opportunity they were more than a decade ago , still have intriguing growth prospects . They still offer exposure to China 's enormous market - according to PricewaterhouseCoopers , China could be the largest economy in the world with about 20 % of world GDP by 2050 . And they still can leverage the country 's expanding middle class and booming Internet presence . China has several companies that operate essentially parallel to big U.S. stocks , especially in the technology sector . However , many of these companies have evolved into massive hybrid beats , catering to their users in both the online and offline space . Several of these stocks are trading on the cheap thanks to ongoing trade-war fears between the U.S. and China . However , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein calls Trump 's threat of slamming tariffs on another $ 200 billion of Chinese imports a negotiating tactic . \" That 's what you would do if it was a negotiating position , and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much firepower you had to bring to the negotiation , \" he said . With this in mind , we used TipRanks ' unique market data to pinpoint five trending Chinese stocks with big Wall Street support . The following is a look at these stocks , analysts ' average price targets and an explanation as to why Wall Street is so bullish right now . Here 's a look at these five \" Strong Buy \" stocks from the \" Middle Kingdom . \" Getty Images Market value : $ 91.7 billion TipRanks consensus price target : $ 296.75 ( 13 % upside potential ) TipRanks consensus rating : Moderate Buy * Baidu ( BIDU , $ 262.11 ) , also known as the \" Google of China , \" is a Chinese search operator that also offers everything from maps to cloud services to artificial intelligence . And it 's undervalued , top Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein ( view Helfstein 's TipRanks profile ) recently said . The valuation is particularly compelling among Chinese stocks when you compare it to the stock 's impressive core growth rate . Helfstein lauded BIDU 's valuation of 11 times estimates for 2019 core EBITDA - too low for China 's leading search engine , and too low for a company that 's estimated to grow at 25 % annually between 2017 and 2020 . He reiterated his \" Buy \" rating on BIDU on May 21 with a $ 295 price target , believing that the market overreacted to news in May that COO Qi Lu was leaving the company , especially given that Baidu still has a disciplined budget system in place . Baidu also is investing heavily in a several new technologies , including AI , the cloud , self-driving cars and online video . According to Helfstein , Baidu is in prime position to benefit from the growth of internet advertising in China . \" We think key drivers include increasing number of paid clicks , higher conversion rates , and higher cost-per-click ( CPC ) \" he writes . The penetration of smartphones in China provides another strong revenue stream for BIDU as it starts to monetize mobile search separately . * BIDU garners a consensus \" Strong Buy \" from TipRanks-designated \" Top \" advisers .

		"paragraph": "The acceptance of body hair on females and femmes has become increasingly widespread over the last few years . We have bloggers , social media influencers , and celebs like Bella Thorne , Miley Cyrus , and Paris Jackson all of whom have repped their body hair loud and proud to credit for the newfound ( relative ) tolerance . The attitudes around stubble , fuzz , and fully grown-out hair are finally starting to change when it comes to women . Despite this promising progression , not everyone feels at home with their body hair , and children afraid of being teased by their peers are at the top of the list . For example , the Irish Sun reports that a distressed mother turned to the parenting forum Mumsnet to seek advice about what to do with her 6-year-old daughter , who hates her leg hair . The mom , who goes by TellerTuesday4EVA on Mumsnet , wrote a detailed post about her dilemma of whether or not to let her daughter , who she calls \" DD \" , remove her leg hair . \" A big part of me knows this is ridiculous but there 's another part that wants DD to make her own choices , \" she writes , before adding that DD has always had very hairy legs and a hairy back . \" I presumed it was baby down & would go away in time , but it has n't & it 's gone darker as she 's gotten older . \" She reveals that she thinks it could be linked to hormones and then goes on to explain how insecure it 's made her daughter . \" In the summer , she became aware of it & that the other girls at school did n't have the same [ and ] she asked me if there was a way to get rid of the hair . \" After having a discussion about everyone 's bodies being different , DD 's doubts were allayed for a while however , her mom says they returned once school started up again . The mom also addressed the fact that none of her classmates have mentioned the hair or teased her because of it , and that it 's really DD herself who has the issue . \" Now that the weather 's getting colder , she 's into tights and trousers for her uniform so that 's pacified her again , \" she added . \" However , she 's now getting upset about swimming and not wanting to go because she says when her legs get wet it looks worse the hair [ is ] quite long , so when it gets wet & lays flat she is right in what she 's saying . \" She says that she would never use hair removal cream on her skin or let her attempt anything herself , but that a part of her feels like she should help her daughter remove it if she 's going to continue to be so adamant about it . She concludes by asking for advice before writing , \" No bitchy comments please , I do realise she 's very young but just want to do my best to help her . \" Luckily , the comments were kind and compassionate , including messages from other moms who shared similar stories and gently suggested taking DD to the doctor for a consultation . Some advocated for letting her remove the hair , as they argued that nothing is worse than feeling self-conscious , while others praised the mom for being so supportive . \" I think you re a great mum supporting her with this ! \" wrote one user . Whatever she decides , it 's encouraging to see moms support one another in parenting and not resort to the all-too-common ( and uncalled for ) mom-shaming we see so often stateside .

Just hours after Jenner whose home was reportedly accessed by an alleged stalker slammed the gossip website TMZ for putting her at risk by publishing photos and details about where she lives , her close friend and fellow catwalker Gigi Hadid has posted her own rant . According to Hadid , 23 , a paparazzo threatened Wednesday to sue her for posting a photo of herself on Instagram without crediting the photographer . Hadid removed the pic in question , but the legal threat set her off and inspired her to lash out against people [ making ] money off us every day , legally stalking us day in and day out . Hadid s two-page note pointed out the absurd irony of the paparazzi taking legal action while putting the general public in danger in pursuit of a photo , including driving dangerously close and recklessly . She acknowledged that celebrity photographers have a job to do and that being photographed in public is part of being famous but insisted that there is a line . We are human beings , Hadid wrote , noting the mental/emotional toll of being pursued by the paparazzi . Her message got tons of support from fellow celebrities , including Kylie Jenner , who commented , We re â€˜ public figures and it s legal for them to invade our privacy . It s pretty disappointing . We got ta change this . But while the likes of Khlo Kardashian , Emily Ratajkowski , and Gisele B ndchen had her back , some unsympathetic followers accused Hadid of making a big deal out of nothing . Oh yawn . Cry me a river , one commenter said . Another defended the paparazzi as trying to make a living and insisted that Hadid was wrong in not crediting the photo as she supposedly benefits from having her photos online . The commenter added that 99 percent of the time it is your PR agency that actually calls paps to keep you and your boyfriend [ Zayn Malik ] relevant in the industry . The model was quick to fire back . You are terribly uninformed , she wrote to the commenter . 1 . I do n t get paid to be in magazines . 2 . A photographer that shoots me for a job can use that image for that job only , it is illegal for that photo or any photo I do not consent to to be reused anywhere outside that publication by the photographer , both parties have rights . It should be the same here . And your final comment shows you know absolutely nothing , what you see is what you see â€¦ me leaving my house , me entering my boyfriend s building . â€¦ I ve never called a pap . Am I just not supposed to go anywhere ever again ??? Lol . If you can figure out a way for them to leave my house I will pay you ! But for all the days I ve stayed inside hoping they ll leave that does n t always happen . â€¦ We do our best to not lock ourselves inside and sneak out when possible , but that s no way to live life . Even if I were to hire one pap and give pics to fans like you re saying , it does n t stop other paps from showing up , suing fan accounts , etc. so does n t really help the issue . Hadid s paparazzi drama comes just months after Ariel Winter faced a similar copyright complaint from a celebrity photographer when she posted a photo of herself on social media . They violated my space so I should at least be able to post it when I want to or just not be f *** ing photographed , the Modern Family star responded .

Price lasted just 1 2/3 innings in Boston 's 6-2 loss on Saturday night , giving up three runs and three hits , including home runs to Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez that cleared the Green Monster . He dropped to 0-9 in 10 postseason starts . Price 's postseason ERA rose to 5.38 , including 6.03 as a starter , as New York evened the best-of-five series 1-1 . '' Just another game . Do n't treat it any differently than any other game , '' he said of his mindset on Thursday . '' I just do n't have an answer for you guys . I 've been asked that quite a while now . I ca n't really put my finger on it . '' Price trudged off the field to a chorus of boos from the Red Sox fans who had cheered him when he took the mound just an inning prior . It was the shortest of Price 's 10 postseason starts . Of 70 pitchers with at least 10 career postseason starts , only Price does n't have a victory . Sanchez 's home run made him 7 for 14 with six long balls against Price , who has allowed 11 homers in 17 1/3 innings against the Yankees in five starts this year . In the third season of a $ 217 million , seven-year contract , Price has never seemed completely comfortable in front of Fenway Park 's demanding fans . He has the right to void the remainder of his contract after the World Series and become a free agent again , forfeiting $ 127 million in guaranteed money . When asked on Thursday if getting his first victory might endear him the Boston 's fans , Price insisted it was n't something he dwelled on .

A statement released by royal officials has also revealed that the bride and groom will include a nod to Princess Diana by having Lady Jane Fellowes do the reading during the ceremony at St. George s Chapel in Windsor . And just who is Lady Jane Fellowes ? She s the groom s aunt and one of his late mother s two older sisters . Born Cynthia Jane Spencer but formally known as Baroness Fellowes through her marriage to Robert Fellowes , the onetime private secretary of Queen Elizabeth II , the 61-year-old has played a key role in royal history . It s rumored that Diana s visit to Scotland for the birth of Fellowes s first daughter , Laura Jane Fellowes , in the summer of 1980 sparked a courtship with Prince Charles . They were married the following year .

		"paragraph": "While Lady Gaga stripped down in minimal makeup for her role as Ally in A Star is Born , Bradley Cooper s rock-star character , Jackson Maine , required a heavy dose of self-tanner and bronzer . Lead makeup artist for the film Ve Neill , whose credits include Pirates of the Caribbean and Edward Scissorhands , tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she and Cooper agreed to transform him into a rugged , tan cowboy for the film . I ve always had an affinity for doing men s looks , and I love the Westerns I m a Western fan , and that whole cowboy theme played out since he was supposed to be a country-western rocker . To get Cooper into character , Neill says , I would have him get a spray tan every other week , but I used Vita Liberata pHenomenal 2-3 Week Tan Mousse ( $ 54 ) on him every day . The makeup pro mixed the sunless tanner with Epicuren Kukui Coconut Moisturizer ( $ 32 ) to get the perfect shade of cowboy tan . It would build up as the week went on , and he always had a nice smell . He looked rugged but smelled good ! In the scenes where Cooper is shirtless , viewers may wonder how his character , a drug-abusing alcoholic , could have such a chiseled set of abs . The answer : It was all natural , no Hollywood magic or body double . He would sit in my chair with his shirt off , and I would tan his entire torso , arms , chest I did n t even have to contour anything , says Neill . She also reveals that getting Cooper to look really messed up required a little bit of makeup magic . I darkened around his eyes using Glazing Gels from Premiere Products . The gray-green shade looked gray on him and made him look very tired , she explains . On days when he was really supposed to look bad , I used those same gels on his bottom lash line and all over the lid in the red color , so he really looked damaged . She also layered an old shadow from Mac called Ashbury over the gels at the lash line to finish off the ashy look . When it came to close-ups , Neill used menthol to make over Cooper s Windex-blue eyes . I also used a menthol blower in his eyes a lot to create that glassy-eyed effect , she says . Anytime you see a close-up , I likely blew menthol in his eyes to give him that look , which also made his eyes look bloodshot . Looking haggard on camera is n t easy , but a rock-star tan is n t complete without a scruffy beard and greased-up hair . His hair is much lighter normally , so I darkened his beard and his eyebrows using Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow ( $ 23 ) in number 30 and 40 for a richer look but kept his gray hairs . As for those noticeable wrinkles and the leathery skin , Neill reveals that all it took was a bit of extra bronzer courtesy of a matte Tom Ford Bronzing Powder ( $ 70 ) . I would have him scrunch his face , and I would stipple the bronzer on high points like the bridge of his nose , the top of his nose , his crow s - feet , and on top of his brows to give him that extra sunny , baked look that made his fine lines more pronounced . The leather jacket , the greasy hair , the tan , and his nice sheen I used Alba Botanica Clear Spray Sunscreen ( $ 10 ) it just made him look very sexy , she adds . Cooper s extensive tanning and makeup transformation did n t take hours on end , says Neill . It did n t take long I m fast about half an hour .

		"paragraph": "By Marwa Rashad RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia 's crown prince wants to build a mega-city with the latest robotics under his grand plan to reform the kingdom . Civil servant Amer al-Ghamdi has a simpler dream : to buy an affordable home . Whether Ghamdi and some 1.2 million Saudis in a similar financial position manage to do so will be vital if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is to convince his people that the reform plan will benefit not just the super-rich . Ghamdi , 35 , spends most of his $ 2,670 monthly wage paying back loans he took to get married and buy a car . He and his wife , Hanan , now have three children and struggle to save money . Buying a home is out of the question . A 250-square metre ( 2,691 square feet ) house in Saudi cities costs from 700,000 to 850,000 riyals ( $ 186,000 to $ 226,000 ) , said Ibrahim Albuloushi , head of U.S. property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle in Saudi Arabia . That is up to 10 times the annual salary for a low-income family in the Gulf Arab state . \" I tried to look for one of my relatives in Saudi to pay off my debts and give me a down payment to apply for a house at one of the commercial banks , but the interest will be very high and I am already paying a lot , \" said Ghamdi , who lives in the capital Riyadh . Saudi Arabia , the world 's top oil exporter , was once awash in petrodollars . This helped it provide a cradle-to-grave welfare system for its citizens with almost no taxation . But a slump in oil prices has made fiscal discipline and diversification away from oil vital . Prince Mohammed 's Vision 2030 plan sets out to modernise the economy and reform the deeply conservative country , the birthplace of Islam . The young prince , 32 , has moved forcefully and rapidly where earlier leaders moved gradually and achieved moderate results . AFFORDABLE HOMES Some Saudis , however , are sceptical . Western media have reported extravagant purchases by the crown prince , including a $ 300 million French chateau and a $ 500 million yacht . In response to a question about these reports in an interview with U.S. network CBS in March , Prince Mohammed said his personal life was \" something I 'd like to keep to myself \" but that he was a rich man who also made donations to charity . The first contracts awarded for the NEOM business zone mega-project in the northwest of the country were for five palaces for the royal family . Some critics say the pace of reform is too fast . They cite cuts to a generous subsidy system and the introduction of value-added tax early this year , moves that have hit some Saudis hard and eaten away at savings . Compounding problems , the population has grown . It reached 32.55 million in 2017 , a rise of 44 percent from 2004 , and Riyadh 's boundaries are growing rapidly . The housing minister says there are plans to build 1 million houses in five years with an investment of over $ 100 billion , mainly through public-private partnerships . Deals have been signed with South Korean and Chinese firms and U.S. companies have expressed interest . \" Real estate is the mirror of the economy . You can not build homes if people can not afford to buy them , \" said Abdullah al-Sudairy , chief executive of mortgage finance company Amlak International . \" Affordable housing means cost is five to six times annual income ... We are not there yet . \" The ministry wants 60 percent of Saudis to own homes by 2020 . It is working with local banks to facilitate financing and help developers increase the supply of affordable units by reducing red tape . WAITING LIST Some 500,000 Saudis are on a waiting list for the Saudi Real Estate Development Fund ( REDF ) , an arm of the housing ministry which offers Saudis interest-free loans to buy state-backed houses which cost around 650,000 riyals . This can be paid in long-term monthly instalments of up to 2,500 riyals each . Khalid al-Amoudi , REDF general supervisor , said most could have access to finance in the next three years . Ghamdi has been on the waiting list since 2011 and relief is nowhere in sight . He has asked his wife to look for a job . But the last offer she received at a food factory offered only 3,500 riyals a month , most of which would have been used to put her infant daughter in nursery and for transportation costs . Ghamdi is worried about taking out a new bank loan because of fears the government may make further cuts in state spending . Salman al-Shedoukhi , a 30-year-old engineer with a monthly income of 15,000 riyals , also wonders if he will ever receive a government-backed house . \" To get bank financing for an average 900,000-riyal home , you will end up paying double this amount . It means I would spend 20 years using half my salary to pay off the loan , \" he said . To save money , he has moved into his father 's house with his wife and two daughters . But he is still burdened by a loan taken out four years ago to get married . NO ROOM FOR ERROR Members of the Shura Council , a government advisory body , have criticised the housing ministry for slow progress in solving the problem and fulfilling citizens ' aspirations , questioning the number of land plots handed over . \" The housing ministry 's biggest achievement is chaining the citizens with a big loan from commercial banks and a bigger monthly instalment , \" Abu Yazid Al Huwaiti , a Saudi citizen , wrote in a Twitter post in April . Some housing officials have been replaced in recent years for failing to tackle the affordability issue . There is no room for error as Prince Mohammed is counting on people like Ghamdi to support his reforms . \" Will they achieve 100 percent of the very ambitious goals they have set for themselves ? Probably not , \" said David Dew , who is managing director of SABB bank and monitors housing and unemployment . \" But will they make serious progress ? Absolutely yes , they have to and they will . \" ( Reporting by Marwa Rashad Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin Editing by Michael Georgy , Ghaida Ghantous and Timothy Heritage )",

		"paragraph": " In the span of just 90 minutes on Tuesday , the United States men s national team managed to be embarrassed by Costa Rica 4-0 , drop to an 0-2 record in the final round of World Cup qualifying for Russia 2018 , worsen its competitive record in San Jose to 0-9-1 and in Costa Rica overall to 0-9-2 , and extend its qualifying losing streak in the Central American nation to 31 years . In a frustrated , error-strewn and disheveling performance , the Americans followed up their narrow 2-1 loss to Mexico last Friday in Columbus , Ohio , with a disjointed and disheartening beating at the hands of the Ticos , who had a dead-simple time of capitalizing on endless defensive mistakes . [ Costa Rica vs. USA : Klinsmann must go | Goalkeeper mess | Match tracker ] A goal on the verge of halftime from Johan Venegas put the visitors backs against the wall . And in the second half , Costa Rica ambled off with the game as Christian Bolanos scored and Joel Campbell got a pair of goals to worsen the pain . The game was testy from the first whistle , with Venegas getting in John Brooks face . And the Costa Rican , like just about every single one of his teammates , would be getting the best of his American opponent . The U.S. mustered almost no possession of consequence and were shaky in the back once more , leaving giant gaps for the Ticos to lope on through . In just the seventh minute , Venegas nutmegged Brooks , stayed ahead of Timmy Chandler , but Brad Guzan came up with the big kick save . Bryan Ruiz attempted an overhead kick from a few yards out and nearly fooled Guzan a little later , but the goalkeeper saved it with his face . What little danger the USA managed to create tended to come from Christian Pulisic , the 18-year-old who ca n t help being the best player on the team . But as the game wore on , he faded from view as the total inability by his peers to connect passes isolated him entirely . Only once did the U.S. go close . Just before halftime , Bobby Wood reached the back line . But his square ball past the beaten Keylor Navas and across the empty goal did n t find a friendly foot . Pulisic was boxed out and arrived late . Then , a bad pass from Jermaine Jones forced a turnover from Brooks . Costa Rica calmly worked the ball to Bolanos , who swung in an uncontested cross as Omar Gonzalez took his sweet time closing him down . Venegas beat Brooks to the header and then Guzan with his finish . Unlike in the Mexico game , when the U.S. was also resoundingly beaten in the first half , things did n t get much better after the break . The Yanks remained wasteful in possession and on set pieces . And , seemingly inevitably , Ruiz was dispatched down the right after Matt Besler was caught out . Ruiz s splendid cross with the outside of the boot found the head of Bolanos , who ran by Chandler and headed past Guzan . That s when Campbell got involved . A routine 74th-minute high ball to Brooks was completely misplayed by the shaken defender , who misread the bounce . Campbell picked the ball up , nutmegged Brooks again , ran off with it and simply poked his finish past Guzan . Four minutes later , Campbell strolled through the offside trap and got a simple second to make it 4-0 . And so the USA has taken no points from its first two games in the hexagonal round , which will send three of six teams to Russia directly after a double round-robin and a fourth to a playoff . Qualifying resumes in late March , giving the Americans an awfully long winter to stew over their humiliating night . Leander Schaerlaeckens is a soccer columnist for Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "Anita Hill , whose testimony against Clarence Thomas riveted the nation and sparked a nationwide conversation about workplace sexual harassment , offered a verdict on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court . I would n t confirm him , Hill said in remarks at Fortune s Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel on Tuesday . I would n t , because I saw a demeanor that I think was inappropriate for a judge . Hill said Kavanaugh offered unsupported facts , avoided answering questions and seemingly blamed Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar for asking pointed questions about his drinking habits as a high school teenager , when he is accused sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a party . Anyone who lies in a Senate Judiciary committee hearing should not be on the Supreme Court , said Hill , who was asked to reflect on Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing and whether she drew parallels to her own testimony 27 years ago . The Kavanaugh hearing , in which Ford detailed her allegation of a sexual assault from when she and the judge were teenagers a charge he denies has brought Hill back to her own testimony . Hill said that while the process felt familiar , but it did n t feel like me . Although her testimony elevated awareness of workplace sexual harassment , Hill said that was not her intention . I was testifying about the character of a person who was being considered for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court , she said . The question remains : whether the senators weighing Kavanaugh s appointment care about his character . I have to say , for at least some of the senators , it did n t seem to matter , Hill said . It did n t matter then and it does n t seem to matter now . Hill had been living a quiet academic life at Brandeis University when reports that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had allegedly sexually assaulted and harassed scores of actresses brought her back into the spotlight . She now leads the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace , an initiative spearheaded by some of Hollywood s most powerful players , which is searching for a way forward . The commission is working to establish best practices for an industry rocked by sexual assault and harassment allegations creating a safe reporting process for people to come forward , one that is well-resourced and has well trained investigators , and is transparent We believe we can set up a framework for reducing the amount of harassment , Hill said . And , we hope , will advance equality in other ways . We know greater diversity and greater equality in general will lead to a reduction in sexual harassment .

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) Melania Trump is heading back toward the southern border of the United States . And this time , she 's not wearing any particular message . The first lady boarded her plane wearing a black shirt and white slacks for the flight . She was expected to visit centers Thursday housing migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border . Mrs. Trump 's spokeswoman declined to immediately release details about her planned stops . The visit comes a week after Mrs. Trump traveled to the border town of McAllen , Texas , to meet with officials there dealing with detained families . She also met with children at one of the facilities . But that trip was overshadowed by a jacket the first lady wore to and from Texas that said on the back : \" I really do n't care , do u ? \" The first lady 's spokeswoman said it was just a jacket , with no hidden message , but interest in her baffling fashion choice was a distraction from Mrs. Trump 's trip . Her husband , President Donald Trump , undercut the no-message message by tweeting that his wife was saying she really does n't care about the \" fake news \" media . This time , Mrs. Trump travels amid upheaval over her husband 's hard-line approach to immigration and evidence of increasing urgency over how that 's playing out . More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents at the border in recent weeks and some were placed in government-contracted shelters hundreds of miles away from their parents . The president last week signed an executive order to halt the separation of families at the border , at least for a few weeks , but the order did not address the reunification of families already separated . A federal judge on Tuesday ordered that thousands of migrant children and parents be reunited within 30 days and sooner if the youngster is under 5 . The order poses logistical problems for the administration , and it was unclear how it would meet the deadline . Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman",

And that means it wo n t be putting any of its newly-released content on Netflix ( NFLX ) starting in 2019 . So what s the fallout ? Well , it wiped a couple billion off of Netflix s market cap . The news also took a toll on other media giants . Viacom ( VIAB ) shares lost 2.5 % , CBS ( CBS ) fell 1.6 % , and 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) dropped 2 % . But parting ways with Disney is n t such a terrible thing for Netflix . It only struck the deal to stream Disney movies a year ago , and it had a strong base of subscribers before that deal even began . Netflix has also been upping the ante on its original content . That s been a sore spot for investors as Netflix s free cash flow has taken a hit ( burning more cash than Tesla in the 12 months ending in March ) . But so far , its strategy has paid off . Plus , as we learned , it s probably more risky to rely on partners like Disney . Netflix could see the writing on the wall , which helps explain why the company made its first ever acquisition in its 20-year history . It s buying Millarworld , a superhero comic book studio , which could serve as a potential replacement for Marvel . So Netflix wo n t be left high-and-dry as Disney launches a competing service .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap contains spoilers for the Trompe L Oeil episode of Westworld . Westworld has been playing its cards close to its vest since it launched seven episodes ago , which , in turn , has prodded audiences to try and actively decode what s going on behind the show s poker face . With Sunday s episode , Trompe L Oeil , the series finally flips over a narrative card , and it s a doozy : Bernard Lowe , Westworld s stalwart head of programming , is as artificial as the hosts he s tasked with overseeing . Now that s a twist that seriously attentive fans probably saw coming : It s certainly been discussed with great frequency online . But to have it confirmed is still a pretty big deal , especially as it potentially holds the key to unknotting other plot threads as the freshman season heads into the homestretch . Here s our update on five of Westworld s big storylines in the wake of Sunday s revelation . Related : Our Westworld Recaps and Postmortems The Hunt for the Maze As we learned back in the pilot , the Man in Black has been a fixture in Westworld for three decades . And during that time , he s explored virtually every nook and cranny of this simulated world , save one : a Maze , whose entrance is presumably buried somewhere amid the yawning canyons and rugged mountains that dot the landscape of a re-created American frontier . He s embarked on this mission under the impression that the Maze is a physical thing yet another level of Westworld s open-world gameplay that had previously been known only to the hosts . And that s why he s conscripted various hosts to assist him in his progress , from outlaw Lawrence to lovestruck cowboy Teddy , discarding them when they ve outlived their usefulness . But as the series has progressed , we ve been receiving signals suggesting that we re dealing with a metaphorical Maze one that might describe a host s journey from programmed automaton to genuine consciousness . That s the path that the show s other Maze-hunter , Dolores , has been walking ever since she fully abandoned her predetermined loop and accompanied new guest William on his own adventure . Dolores first became aware of the Maze in the fifth episode , when Bernard implanted the idea in her artificial mind during one of their face-to-face counseling sessions . Early on , these meetings appeared to be happening in the physical world but now that we know that Bernard is a fellow â€˜ bot , it seems more likely that they re engaging with each other in some kind of shared consciousness , as he guides her through a mental maze where self-awareness waits at the center . Arnold : Lost and Found Stay with us while we take Bernard s role in Dolores s journey a step further . It s been pointed out that Bernard Lowe is an anagram for Arnold Weber , the man who co-created Westworld with Robert Ford some three decades ago . But Arnold did n t survive to see the park become the wealthy tourist destination it is today , opting instead to vanish into his creation under still-mysterious circumstances . As Robert himself has implied , though , Arnold undoubtedly left a small piece of himself behind in the robots he had a direct hand in creating robots like Dolores , who is one of the park s longest-serving hosts . In that case , the Bernard she sees in her mind might actually be Arnold s way of informing her that she s on the right track to completing their original mission : destroying Westworld . Why destroy Westworld ? Because Arnold viewed the entire place as a corruption of his chief interest : creating artificial life . The thought that his children were to become mere sport for flesh-and-blood humans no doubt pushed him to lead the near-cataclysmic charge that resulted in the destroyed offices Bernard visited in last week s episode and the fragments of horrifying memory specifically something involving a church that float through Dolores s mind . Even if Arnold is dead in body as Robert presumes , his ghost is still very much present in his machines . Whose Timeline Is It Anyway ? When William and his soon-to-be brother-in-law , Logan , first disembarked in Westworld back in the second episode , sharp-eyed viewers noted a discrepancy between the clunky park logo the new arrivals saw versus the sleeker one present throughout the premiere . That spawned the hotly debated theory that young William would grow up to become the grizzled Man in Black , and that each episode thus straddles the present and the past . We still do n t have confirmation one way or the other , but Bernard s awakening , at least , is very much happening in the present day , with the future of the park on the line . You Say Maeve Wants a Revolution Independently of Dolores , bordello madam Maeve is also approaching heightened consciousness , albeit with the help of two hapless park employees rather than a mythical maze . The discrepancy between their two approaches is most likely rooted in the fact that Maeve appears to be a more recent model , created after Arthur s heyday when metal faces still hid underneath fleshlike exteriors . It s worth noting that Dolores did trigger Maeve s awakening in the second episode via the words , These violent delights have violent ends . But that never led to visions of Bernard dancing in her head . Instead , Maeve has used Westworld s laboratories as her school , retaining the memories of what she sees . And in this episode , what she sees is the casual murder of Clementine , her friend and employee , who was pulled out of the bordello on the orders of Theresa and Charlotte Hale , the board director of Delos , the corporation that has a controlling interest in Westworld . They want to illustrate to Robert and Bernard that the most recent code update has left the robots capable of remembering the violence visited upon them and responding in kind . Having served her purpose , Clementine is then lobotomized and permanently retired , remembered by no one except Maeve , who now has a very personal reason for vengeance . The Deal With Delos Tensions between Robert and the Delos board have been lightly simmering for some time , escalating after he seized back control of the park s creative direction from self-aggrandizing Narrative Director Lee Sizemore . With Ford literally moving mountains to make his grand new idea a reality , the corporation is understandably a bit concerned about its real interests in Westworld : the intellectual property that makes the park run . Firing Bernard over the code mishap was intended to help ease Robert out the door , but Theresa s subsequent death at Bernard s hands which Ford chillingly calls a blood sacrifice shows that he s instead choosing to view this as a test of his authority â€¦ one that he plans on passing . Westworld airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO .",

		"paragraph": "Apple s next smartphone is almost here . The company is expected to launch three new devices next month , as part of its fall lineup of flagship iPhones . But while newer normally means more advanced , the new devices could also prove a better value prospect than its predecessors . The new phones are expected to come in three flavors , all of which use the same face recognition and home button-free design of the iPhone X . The cheapest is a 6.1-inch LCD model , rumored to ditch high-end features like 3D Touch and the second rear camera lens . The middle phone is likely a 5.8-inch OLED model , bearing similarities to an upgraded version of the iPhone X . The third is a 6.5-inch OLED model , acting as a large-scale version of last year s phone . CEO Tim Cook shocked observers last September when he announced that the iPhone X launching two months later would cost a staggering $ 999 . This was the highest price ever for an iPhone , aping even the original device that launched in 2007 ( but which did , in all fairness , require a minimum length carrier contract ) . Fortunately , such a shock is unlikely this year . Here s what to expect : Ming Chi-Kuo , a former KGI Securities analyst with a strong track record of accurate predictions , has detailed Apple s likely lineup : The 6.1-inch model , in particular , offers an attractive price for the technology on offer . A report last month claimed Apple has managed to include an LCD screen into a design with relatively thin bezels , creating a 0.3 t chip that improves on the 0.4 t ones found in most phones by reducing the screen connectors from 4-4.5 mm down to just 2-2.5 mm . However , be sure to keep an eye on the used market prices if you re looking to sell your old phone . Analysis from uSell found that old iPhones lost about five percent of their value one week after the next device launched , dropping 20 percent by week four . Apple has launched its last several flagship phones on the second week of September , releasing in the second half of the month . A leak from German site Macerkopf claims pre-orders will go live on September 14 , suggesting the phones will launch two days prior . However , previous reports suggest the 6.1-inch model could launch in October due to the new LCD chip . All will likely be revealed soon . Photos via Unsplash / Drew Coffman",

		"paragraph": "Following close behind the controversial news of a Kentucky woman shooting and killing a black giraffe comes a story in which the hunters become the hunted . South Africa s Sibuya Game Reserve shared a press release on Thursday regarding the mauling death of a group of poachers . The park reports that between Sunday evening and Monday morning , three poachers entered the reserve , likely looking for rhinos . They were armed with , amongst other things , a high powered rifle with a silencer , an axe , wire cutters and had food supplies for a number of days all the hallmarks of a gang intent on killing rhino and removing their horns , reads the park s press release . Around 4:30 a.m. Monday morning , the reserve s anti-poaching dogs began to act agitated , but when a handler heard a loud commotion coming from a nearby pride of lions , they figured it was this ruckus that caused the dogs to act out . It was n t until Tuesday afternoon that park officials found human remains near the lion pride that had been making noise the day prior . At about 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday 3rd July one of our field guides on game drive alerted the Anti-Poaching Unit that there appeared to be human remains as well as other items in the immediate vicinity of the lions . I was immediately called to the scene where along with the APU we found the high powered rifle , gloves , wire cutters and the remains of a back pack with food , water and other supplies , Sibuya Game Reserve owner Nick Fox wrote in a statement . Based on this evidence , Fox thinks it is clear that the dogs responded to the poachers presence , but that the poachers unknowingly walked into a group of six lions , causing the commotion the handler heard , before the canines could respond . The lions likely attacked and ate at least one if not all of the poachers . Authorities are currently examining the scene where the remains were found to get more details . As it was already dark it was not possible to investigate the area until first light at which time we arranged for our vet to dart the entire pride of lions so that Police forensic teams assisted by our Anti-poaching unit could comb the immediate area for clues , Fox wrote in his statement about what happened after the remains were found . At this stage it is not clear exactly how many poachers were killed but the Police forensic team continue to investigate . The only body part we found was one skull and one bit of pelvis , everything else was completely gone , Fox told Newsweek . There is so little left that they do n t know exactly how many people were killed , we suspect three because we found three sets of shoes and three sets of gloves . BBC reports that police are also patrolling the area to ensure that the poachers if any survived do n t return to hurt any of the animals in the reserve . Fox also shared with Newsweek that he hopes this incident sends a message to other poachers , even though he is saddened by the loss of human life . As one of the most popular game reserves in the country , Sibuya is unfortunately familiar with poachers and their efforts to kill and defile rare animals . In 2016 , three of the park s rhinos were shot and killed by poachers for their horns .",

Early in the month , Ford unveiled the fourth-generation Focus an all-new design inside and out that took the compact car more upscale . A few weeks later , Ford announced it d be stopping the sale of several cars in the U.S. , including the Focus hatchback and sedan leaving only the Focus Active crossover and Mustang . So , this video from Autogef hl is more of a tease than a look at anything we ll get in the U.S . The video takes an in-depth look at the Focus ST-Line hatch and wagon two models U.S. consumers can only dream of driving . The video meticulously covers just about every new detail regarding the new fourth-generation Focus over its 45-minute runtime . There s a design overview of both the hatch and wagon before looking under the hood . The new Focus has a much more elegant and aggressive design than the outgoing model , with a wider front grille , bigger headlights , and some bold design lines down the side of the body . At the rear , the host points out similarities to the new Mercedes A-Class . Moving inside , you get to see the sportier interior that comes with the ST-Line , such as the contrasting red stitching on the cloth seats and the flat-bottomed steering wheel . The hatch is equipped with a six-speed manual while automatic-equipped vehicles receive a dial gear selector . There s also a new head-up display . There are a ton of features covered in the video if you want to get in-depth with the new Focus . While the U.S. wo n t see the hatch , sedan , or wagon version of the Focus , we will get the Focus Active , which will have many of the same design elements and features inside and out when the vehicle reaches dealerships .

Smith signed on with the Raiders in 2015 , but played in just nine games before violating the league s substance abuse policy for a second time . He received a year-long suspension . At some point , Smith s suspension was made indefinite until he resolved his court case from his 2015 incident . Smith pleaded no contest to a hit and run , and had his DUI charges dropped .

		"paragraph": " McNulty ( Dominic West ) and Stringer Bell ( Idris Elba ) could only be there via videotaped messages , but a big lineup of The Wire castmates , series creator David Simon , and producer Nina Noble filled a Paleyfest NY stage for a nearly 90-minute anecdote-filled discussion about the HBO drama that many fans consider the greatest TV series of all time . From a panel that included John Doman , Lawrence Gilliard Jr. , Seth Gilliam , Jim True-Frost , Jamie Hector , Michael Kenneth Williams , Sonja Sohn , and Wendell Pierce , we discovered which actor was once so worried the show might be contributing to the problems it focused on that he considered quitting we learned about the cast 's ritual for when an actor or actress was about to be killed off The Wire and about which beloved character was going to be killed off in Season 1 until an HBO exec intervened . Photos : Check Out More Pics From This Year 's PaleyFest New York Read on for those and seven more revelations at The Wire cast reunion at PaleyFest NY . Then , watch the entire panel video for yourself ( although , not that we really need to mention this to The Wire devoted , but , expect plenty of four-letter words in said video ) : 1 . Turkish Fans Doman , speaking about being recognized as a star of the show , said he was once in Istanbul when a fan came up to him and began talking about The Wire in another language . \" Wire \" was the only word he understood . 2 . Is Elba the Next 007 ? When a video greeting from Elba was introduced , Simon said , \" Is n't he James Bond yet ? \" We have been wondering the same thing â€¦ 3 . Meet the Real Bunk ! Fan favorite Pierce The Bunk ! can be seen in the clip below recalling how unimpressed Rick Requer the real-life Baltimore cop who inspired the Bunk character seemed to be when he first saw Pierce . Today , the two are pals , and even have plans to attend a New Orleans Saints game together . 4 . \" I Was an Angry Black Man \" Williams was not initially a fan of Season 2 's shifting storylines , which moved some of the action to the docks of Baltimore 's ports and away from the projects . \" I got real bitter . I was the angry black man , \" Williams said . \" I approached David , and I was like , ' How come we made this show hot , and then you want to give it to the white people ?! ' \" Co-star Gilliam said he and co-star Dominick Lombardozzi were also displeased at what they worried were diminishing roles for their characters in Season 2 , and even had an angry sitdown with Simon about the situation . Lombardozzi was pacified by Simon 's explanation and his advice to channel their frustrations into their performances , prompting a must-see impersonation of Lombardozzi by Gilliam , now a cast member on The Walking Dead . 5 . Sorry , D'Angelo Another Wire star who 's moved on to The Walking Dead Gilliard said he knew the moment he read his first script how special the show was , which prompted Simon to apologize for killing off his D'Angelo Barksdale in Season 2 . A Gilliard-Simon hug ensued . 6 . A Wire Tradition Simon said J.D. Williams , whose Bodie was killed off in Season 4 , handled news of his character 's impending death better than any other cast member who received similar news . Pierce added that the cast developed a tradition for dealing with co-star deaths : They would make plans to show up and watch them film their final scenes , even if they were off that day . 7 . How Kima Was Saved Sohn 's Kima Greggs was originally going to be killed off in Season 1 . But former HBO entertainment president Carolyn Strauss talked Simon out of the character 's demise , and Greggs became not only a fan favorite , but she remained with the series for all five seasons . 8 . Pierce Almost Quits Pierce said he once considered quitting the show , when he began to worry the violence and focus on dark topics on The Wire was accentuating the problems instead of simply shedding light on them . He reconsidered , and said he came to see that the series ' examination of the public school system was actually the best representation of what 's going on in our society . 9 . Close to Home Sohn said the show 's subject matter forced her to deal with some painful family history : memories of her real-life drug dealer brother . 10 . Not a Wire Fan He did n't mention him by name , but Simon confirmed Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley among the politicians who inspired Aidan Gillen 's Tommy Carcetti is not a fan of The Wire , which he believes inspired O'Malley 's decision to cut film incentives for Hollywood productions in Baltimore in 2008 .

		"paragraph": "This has been a big month for Social Security and its more than 62 million recipients . On Oct. 11 , 2018 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) released its September inflation data , which provided the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) with the final data point needed to calculate the 2019 cost-of-living adjustment , or COLA . Think of COLA as the \" raise \" that beneficiaries receive from one year to the next . The result , thanks to higher energy and shelter prices , is a healthy 2.8 % increase in benefits for 2019 , which marks the largest bump since 2012 . Considering that Medicare Part B premiums are only rising by a little over 1 % , this should result in a genuinely higher net payout for a majority of beneficiaries next year . Image source : Getty Images . However , the annual COLA release is just one of many data points that gets adjusted each year by the SSA . In addition to the 2019 COLA , the SSA also announced changes to the payroll tax earnings cap for the following year . In essence , it means wealthier workers will be paying more into the Social Security program in 2019 . Of the three funding sources for Social Security -- the payroll tax , interest income on its asset reserves , and the taxation of benefits -- the 12.4 % payroll tax on earned income unquestionably does the heavy lifting . Last year , $ 873.6 billion of the $ 996.6 billion in revenue collected for the program was generated by the payroll tax on earned income . But the interesting thing about Social Security 's 12.4 % payroll tax is that not all income is subject to it . In 2018 , earned income up to $ 128,400 is subject to the payroll tax , with any earnings above this amount exempted . This allows a small percentage of working Americans ( less than 1 in 10 ) to escape paying into Social Security with some , or most , of their income , depending on their earnings . Why not apply the payroll tax to all income ? The straightforward answer is because the SSA also caps the maximum retirement benefit at full retirement age each year . In 2018 , regardless of whether you average $ 150,000 in income a year during your lifetime or $ 10 million annually , your maximum retirement benefit at full retirement age is $ 2,788 a month . Since there 's a cap on what an individual can be paid from Social Security at full retirement age , there 's also a cap on what amount of earned income is taxable by Social Security 's payroll tax . Image source : Getty Images . Assuming COLA is positive -- the earnings cap remains unchanged in years when no COLA is passed along -- the payroll tax cap is increased on par with the National Average Wage Index ( NAWI ) . With the NAWI having risen 3.45 % in 2017 ( $ 48,642.15 in 2016 to $ 50,321.89 in 2017 ) , the payroll tax cap will increase by 3.5 % , when rounded to the nearest 0.1 % , in 2019 . This works out to a new cap of $ 132,900 next year , up from $ 128,400 in 2018 . This means that the less than 1 in 10 rich workers earning above $ 128,400 will have to pay more into the program next year . Of course , there is a difference between being a well-to-do employee and being self-employed . Regardless of how much you earn each year , if you 're employed by someone else , your employer will cover half of your Social Security payroll tax liability up to the cap ( $ 132,900 in 2019 ) . Rather than paying 12.4 % , you as an employee would owe 6.2 % , with your employer picking up the other half . Thus , if we 're talking about a well-to-do employee , he or she could owe a maximum of $ 8,239.80 in 2019 , or up to $ 279 more than they paid in 2018 . If you 're self-employed , you can expect a bigger bite out of your pocket . That 's because the self-employed are responsible for the full 12.4 % Social Security tax up to $ 132,900 . Next year that 'll work out to $ 16,479.60 , or $ 558 more than in 2018 , assuming a self-employed worker hit the cap in both years . Image source : Getty Images . Despite this increase in the payroll tax cap , it 's worth pointing out that a lot of earned income escapes taxation each year . According to data from the SSA , approximately $ 300 billion in earnings escaped taxation ( i.e. , was above the taxable cap ) back in 1983 . However , this figure had quadrupled to $ 1.2 trillion by 2016 . Even with annual increases to the tax cap that are commensurate with average wage growth , the rich are seeing their money grow at a substantially quicker pace , thereby allowing more income to escape taxation . Now , here 's where things get interesting . If the cap were removed completely and , like Medicare , all earned income were exposed to program taxation , then it would almost certainly erase the $ 13.2 trillion cash shortfall Social Security is facing between 2034 and 2092 . The reason the cap has n't been increased substantially to ensure that less income escapes taxation has to do with the aforementioned cap on monthly payouts at full retirement age , as well as the inability of Republicans and Democrats to agree on an amicable solution to the program 's cash shortfall . In other words , even though the cap is rising , more income than ever is likely to escape Social Security 's payroll tax . More From The Motley Fool The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .",

		"paragraph": "In 1993 , after taking a summer off to attend film school at NYU , Daryl Hannah wrote , directed , and produced the short film The Last Supper , which won a Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival . But it took until now for her to make her full-length feature directorial debut : Paradox , a lo-fi , sci-fi western musical starring her boyfriend Neil Young , Promise of the Real , and Willie Nelson , which premiered Thursday night at the South by Southwest festival in Austin , Texas . I ca n t even tell you how many years I told my manager I wanted [ to direct ] , Hannah tells Yahoo Entertainment . I have been working on actual , real scripts and stuff for years , and have things that I ve developed over the years that I wanted to make as narrative features , and I never even could get a meeting . I even had production deals , but they were always kind of like vanity production deals , ultimately . Hannah , who has spoken before about being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein ( including one scary encounter when he burst into her hotel room ) , pauses when asked about her struggles in Hollywood . There s so many stories , but I actually never got a meeting on a movie after Kill Bill , not one not an offer , not a meeting , not an anything . The next thing I got was Sense8 , and that was accidental . They called me for a phone number for somebody else , and they were like , â€˜ Why do n t you come in ? I have no idea why . [ Kill Bill ] was a big , successful movie , but I never got even a meeting , nothing . I think it was â€¦ maybe tied slightly to the Harvey thing , because that was part of it . He was telling people I was â€˜ difficult , because I kicked him out of my room ! Interestingly , in Paradox , a movie made far outside the Hollywood machine , Hannah envisions a utopian future when the womenfolk had rightfully just about given up on men , in which a band of male outlaw prospectors led by Young s grizzled character , the Man in the Black Hat work for a tribe of frontierswomen . Every once in a while , I think probably almost every woman has fantasized about just living in a commune or something with their girlfriends and making art and raising babies and growing food , and just letting the guys come visit once in a while , Hannah chuckles . [ Paradox ] was just sort of a little exploration of that fantasy , that in the future women have just said , â€˜ You know what ? We re done with the mining , the plundering , the pillaging , the fighting . We re just going to go over here . We ll take care of the land . We ll take care of the kids . You guys try to stay alive . We ll come and visit you once in a while . The women [ in the film ] still have a good feeling about the men , though it s not like they ve written them off completely ! The real man in Daryl s life , Neil Young , says he was delighted to be part of Hannah s quirky vision . Daryl did everything . She wrote the script , she went out to the thrift shops and bought all of the costumes herself , he marvels . She is a real artist , and she knows what she wants . She wrote what everybody said . She gave us good direction throughout the whole thing . â€¦ Daryl is great at what she does . She s a true professional , and a joy to work with . [ Neil ] has such a natural communication with the artistic process that he does n t question it , ever , Hannah adds . He just was like , â€˜ Oh , yeah , right . We re making a movie . It was very natural . Young says he trusted his partner s vision so much , I never read the script . â€¦ I said , â€˜ Why do n t you just tell me my lines ? She told me about the story , and so I wanted to see it develop . There s one amusing line in the Paradox script , uttered in the outhouse , that stands out : Love is like a fart . If you have to force it , it s probably s *** . Hearing that line recited back to him , Young chuckles . That sounds about right . Young speaks glowingly of Hannah , and he says nothing about their romance has ever felt like a struggle at all even when working together on a movie set . She says I m unruly , and I think she s too tough , but aside from that , we re great ! he laughs . More seriously , he continues , We re pretty real . As artists , we support each other and understand , because we both have an element of fame . We understand what that means . It seems like Young is referring to the media scrutiny that exploded once he and Hannah went public with their relationship , following his divorce from his wife of 36 years , Pegi . But he insists , We did n t pay any attention to that . It does n t matter . We do n t give a s *** . We do n t care , because they do n t know what they re talking about . And if they do know what they re talking about , we still do n t care , but we re happy for them . It does n t matter . What matters is us , not the press . It was n t just the press that had opinions on the Young/Hannah romance : Young s onetime CSNY bandmate David Crosby also had some nasty words ( for which Crosby later apologized ) . When we got together , even some of my good friends were negative about it , and I could never understand it , muses Young . [ Daryl is ] a wonderful human being , and I m very lucky to know her . That s all I was thinking . Nowadays , Young seems in great spirits , with a slew of forthcoming new releases including the Paradox soundtrack , which features six new musical interludes with Promise of the Real and it seems Hannah has a lot to do with the 72-year-old s zest for life . She s helped me physically to be stronger she s got a really intense physical regimen she follows , and I crawl along behind her , Young reveals , laughing . We do Pilates twice a week , sometimes three times a week , and get in the pool with weights . We have routines we do in the pool , a lot of stuff together like that . There s always something . â€¦ I m very lucky . We re very lucky to have found each other . I m eternally thankful for the opportunity to share my life with her , and she feels the same . That sense of joy permeates Paradox , a freeform romp shot over two days in the Colorado mountains on a shoestring budget . ( It was more of a no-string budget , jokes Hannah . It was like a Velcro budget , quips Young . ) It was just for fun . We wanted to make a movie , so why not ? Young says . We had all these people , everybody s capable of doing it , and we had some time to kill . We started talking about it about a week before we did it . â€¦ We said , â€˜ Do you really want to do this ? Yeah ? OK , let s get the tent . There was a lot that was just sort of improvised , or you did n t even realize we were filming . â€¦ We just did it for a couple of days , by ourselves , Hannah says . We just made it . We did n t go around asking anybody for permission or organizing . Most of these guys were wearing my clothes , or stuff I got at the thrift store . We did everything ourselves . It was just like , â€˜ Let s make a movie ! We had no limitations . We just did n t have any money , adds Young . Ironically , Paradox was n t even supposed to be Hannah s full-length directorial debut she d only written a 10-page script . But she , Young , and Promise of the Real were having so much fun , We just kept shooting , says Young . We d get up in the morning and shoot all day and never stop . Eventually , Hannah ended up with enough footage for a 73-minute feature , which will make its Netflix debut March 23 . It was n t made like a normal movie . That s why it is n t a normal movie . â€¦ If you go in expecting an ordinary movie , you re going to be confused , Hannah laughs . Hannah still has plans to make a more conventional film , based on an old Irish folk tale that was adapted by the poet W.B. Yeats , though she is n t sure when that will happen . I m going to need an actual budget and an actual crew for that one , she chuckles . But with Young by her side , she says , I will always do creative stuff . That s just the way it goes .

		"paragraph": "When 28-year-old Diana Andino walked across the stage at Loyola University s Stritch School of Medicine a week ago Sunday , she became one of the first group of DACA recipients in the nation to graduate from medical school . In June , she ll become the first ( and only ) DACA recipient to start a residency in neurology . When I asked her a few days after graduation how this felt , she let out a triumphant sigh : Amazing . Formally known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , DACA allows children brought to the United States by their parents illegally as minors ( in Andino s case , from Ecuador ) to apply for a renewable , two-year protection under the law . Since its inception in 2012 , the program has paved the way for more than 800,000 kids of undocumented immigrants to obtain work permits and go to school . As a relic of President Obama , DACA has come under significant fire from President Trump and his base disapproval that has manifested both in vitriolic tweets and legitimate attempts to rescind it by Congress . While the program still stands , threats to its existence have n t ceased . So what does all of this mean to Andino and the other five DACA recipients who just graduated from med school ? It means their experience has been unlike any other . As the first six DACA medical students ( all at Loyola ) , they were forced to weave activism into academics , squeezing meetings with senators into interviews at hospitals . Not to mention they had to endure a series of overtly racist speeches ( which , Andino tells me , always seemed to happen the night before big exams ) . The fact that they prevailed despite it all is a master class in resilience , and a victory for undocumented immigrants everywhere . Now the next hurdle will be making it through residency , after which Andino and her peers will officially become the first DACA recipients to become doctors . But for now , at the finish line of a four-year long journey , Andino has just one thing on her mind : Sleep ! Yahoo Lifestyle : Take us back to the beginning . Where were you before America ? Diana Andino : I m originally from Ecuador Quito , which is the capital city . I was there until 2001 . When I moved to Houston , Texas , where I grew up , I was 11 . My dad had moved there about a year before that . There was a lot of stuff happening in Ecuador at the time . The economy , there was bankruptcy , and a lot of businesses were closing down . We got hit with that . So he saw the situation was really hard , and was able to get a visa to come to America . My mom and I came on tourist visas to join him . What grade were you in at the time , and were you aware of your legal status ? I came for a couple months of seventh grade but my full first year was eighth grade . I was n t really aware . At that time , Houston was very immigrant friendly , we were able to get IDs and I was able to enroll in school , and once you graduated from school in Texas , then you could continue right to college and get an undergraduate degree , so all of that was OK . But just trying to get a job once you turn 16 , that s when you start noticing OK , maybe this is n t that easy . I always knew immigration was an issue , but I did n t realize how much until I needed to get a job and a driver s license . When did you decide you wanted to be a doctor ? It was n t until I went to college [ at the University of Houston ] that it all clicked . I was undeclared at first , but by my sophomore year I had started volunteering at a county hospital , and started taking some science classes at the same time . Houston is very diverse , and at that hospital 50 to 75 percent of people were Spanish speakers , so I volunteered there as a Spanish interpreter . That s how I learned that medicine was my calling . Did you feel like there was adequate medical care in that community ? Not really . Growing up , the only [ medical ] care that I knew was taking my parents to free clinics or health fairs that the church would put out . We never got to see a doctor or anything like that growing up . So you graduated from the University of Houston in 2011 with a biology major and chemistry minor . Then President Obama passed DACA the next year . What happened then ? I applied right away and got my permit and everything by September of that year . Then I applied the following cycle for medical school and got in the first round , so I was able to start in the 2014 year . By this time I had taken all my prerequisites and done volunteer work and already taken the MCATs . I had just been waiting to have a work permit to be able to apply . Once you got into Loyola , were you able to apply for student loans ? As undocumented , DACA does n t grant us our status yet so we can not access those funds . The way that we pay for school is we have an agreement with Illinois Finance Authority , which is with the state , where they lend us the money to pay for school and then we ll pay it back and serve in an underserved area here after we ve finished residency . So that was their agreement and that was how they give us the loans . We have to pay it back but we also have to fulfill the requirement of working in an underserved area . But that s what you wanted to do anyway , right ? Yes , that was never an issue . For me , I want to practice in hopefully a Spanish-speaking community hospital , where I can probably make the most impact with people who are underserved . I think that s where I feel most at home and where I can have a better impact . And your experience at Loyola , how has it been ? It s been amazing . There have been a lot of really hard times , obviously , because it s med school and it s not easy , but they have made it an extremely supportive environment since day one . The admissions people , the dean , they have been super open and receptive . Whatever we need , they ve been able to give us . They were the first medical school to admit DACA students and we were the first cohort ( six of us ) . So it s their first time going through something like this too . It s kind of new for everyone . The six of you must have been close . Since day one we did n t have to explain to each other what DACA meant . Our lives were very similar since we all moved to the states at [ as young kids ] . We had the same struggles , so we all knew exactly what each of us were feeling basically at every press conference . Our stories were very similar to each other . When people in the government were discussing DACA publicly , did you lean on each other for support ? Any big announcement , any DACA news , we knew exactly what that meant . We all had each other s backs as we went through it . Same with the interviews and applications for match , we did n t know how it would work out for us given that we did n t have a status , so we all relied on each other to see how we were doing and be that support system . [ All six were matched ] . Now that you ve cleared this hurdle , what would you say was the biggest challenge ? Just navigating the way as the first [ DACA recipients to do this openly , that was very challenging . We were put at the forefront of it , and Loyola has given us a platform , unexpectedly , over the last four years . But we re also still medical students , so trying to have a balance between those two roles of being medical students and trying to figure out what speciality we want to be , while at the same time bringing a voice to the rest of the undocumented community and being a role model for the other students . Some of us would go talk to senators in Washington , D.C. , or do other things like that , so it s kind like having two parallel growth processes you re going through . I think trying to balance that out the past four years has been challenging , but I think we did a really good job . I imagine one particularly tough day was when DACA was temporarily rescinded . Do you remember that day ? I was in surgical rotation that [ day ] , but I knew something was going to happen because we had heard about it from insiders . So that day I did not bring my phone to the operating room , I left it , and I was just a normal medical student that day . But at the end of the day I opened my phone and I had all these missed calls and messages , and then I went back to being a DACA person . It was scary , but we knew it would happen at some point , so I think we were mentally ready but still in shock . We took 48 hours to mourn and then were like , We have to get back to it again . In January the program was revived , and apparently the renewals will be issued soon . Where are you in the process ? We have to submit to get it renewed every two years . I submitted my renewal but I m still pending . I have n t received anything and it s been three months . My permit expires in 2020 , and I m supposed to start residency . I m thankful that I have a job to go to , but it s all contingent that I get my approval . So I m hoping for that to come sometime soon , hopefully this month . What is the hardest part now about being a medical school graduate who is also a DACA recipient ? Just not knowing what s going to happen . This does n t give us any permanent residency or give us a pass for a green card , so always knowing that we re still not safe is hard . I think that s always in the back of our minds . We try not to worry about it , but some days are worse than others . But we just manage to get through and so far it has worked out so I think we all feel like things will be OK at this point . That we ll be able to finish our residency and go from there .

		"paragraph": "In the late 1970s , New York City was electrified and petrified by a serial killer who snuck up on people sitting in parked cars and shot them most of his victims were women . A new documentary , The Lost Tapes : Son of Sam , gives you a vivid sense of what it was like to live in Manhattan or the Bronx in those days , wondering whether the man who signed his letters Son of Sam was going to creep up behind you with his trademark .44 caliber pistol . We now know that Son of Sam was David Berkowitz , a postal worker who claimed that a demonic spirit named Sam spoke to him through his neighbor s dog . Dubbing himself Son of Sam , Berkowitz made himself into a media figure by sending messages to the police and the public , taking credit for some of the killings and warning that he d soon do it again . The killer sent Jimmy Breslin , then a star columnist for The New York Daily News , a letter that was not without some small literary merit . It began , Hello from the gutters of N.Y.C. , which are filled with dog manure , vomit , stale wine , urine , and blood . This bloody saga is made vivid and engrossing by Smithsonian Channel s The Lost Tapes series , which does something ever more valuable on television these days : It s a true-crime show without voice-over narration and , most important , none of those awful dramatic recreations that make so much true-crime TV look cheap and unconvincing . The Lost Tapes method sounds simple use local TV footage of man-and-woman-on-the-street interviews , press conferences , and period interviews with the principals but it gives the resulting narrative a stinging authenticity . For its Son of Sam entry premiering July 30 , The Lost Tapes summons up the spirit the Manhattan media of the 70s : the TV-news reports and newspaper coverage that was at once solid shoe-leather reporting and tabloid-exploitive rabble-rousing . Anyone who lived in New York City at the time will be pleased to see the faces of once-familiar reporters like Dick Schaap , Dave Marash , Geraldo Rivera when he was just beginning his career of exploiting tragedy for melodramatic self-promotion , and , above all , Jimmy Breslin , with his gravelly Queens accent and surly pugnaciousness . In that era , before the Internet leveled the playing field , a newspaper columnist like Breslin spoke to his readers in so intimate a way that even an addled murderer like Berkowitz understood that , if you wanted to scare the daylights out of the citizenry , your best bet was to get Breslin to serve as your mouthpiece . Breslin shared his Son of Sam communiques with the New York City Police Department , which had placed no fewer than 75 detectives on this one case full-time , to maintain contact with Berkowitz until the latter s arrest in 1977 . Berkowitz is now in jail and in his 60s , an evangelical Christian who has re-named himself Son of Hope . Forty years on , pop culture has been overrun with serial-killer movies , TV shows , and books . ( Spike Lee made a Son of Sam movie called Summer of Sam in 1999 . ) But if you want to know to feel in your bones the fear that gripped New York City 40 years ago , this Lost Tapes entry will probably send a shiver up your spine . The Lost Tapes : Son of Sam airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on Smithsonian Channel .

		"paragraph": "Since his debut more than 30 years ago in the original Donkey Kong , Nintendo s Mario has appeared in more than 200 different games , become an international icon and turned Nintendo into a household name . And now he s coming to your smartphone . Launching Dec. 15 for Apple s iPhone and iPad and coming to Android devices in the near future , Super Mario Run is the first Mario game for any smartphone platform . Available for $ 9.99 , Super Mario Run features three game modes : World Tour , Toad Rally and Kingdom Builder . I played a 30-minute demo of the game and spoke with Mario s creator Shigeru Miyamoto about how the game came together , what it means for Nintendo and how he hopes it will bring Mario to even more people around the world . How about this : Super Mario Run is n t your typical Mario game , which let you use a controller to manipulate where Mario runs , jumps , and shoots fireballs . Rather , Run simply lets you control when and how he jumps . The thought processes behind this , Miyamoto explained , was to allow people to play the game with one hand , while commuting for instance , and to make it more approachable for first-time gamers . That s especially important considering that Super Mario Run will be available in some 150 countries this year . Compare that to typical Mario games for Nintendo s traditional consoles , which are released in about 30 countries , coupled with the massive number of smartphones on the market , and you can understand why the company worked to ensure Super Mario Run is as accessible as possible . During my playthrough I ran through five World Tour courses , which see the titular portly plumber run from left to right until he reaches the flagpole marking the end of the level . Along the way Mario will automatically vault over small barriers and enemies like Goombas , those sentient mushrooms with teeth . If you want him to jump to reach coins , you simply tap the screen . To jump higher , you long press the screen . It s all very simple really , but that s just scratching the surface . The real fun begins when you realize that you can double jump , bounce off walls , and fly backwards off special platforms that send you rocketing backwards . Mario s animations are smooth and fluid and look as good as anything Nintendo has built for its 3DS handheld and Wii U home consoles . The ultimate goal of each World Tour level is to grab as many coins as possible and finish with a high score in order to gain rally tickets to play Super Mario Run s Toad Rally mode . Toad Rally is where things get really interesting . Using the tickets you earned by playing World Tour , you race against friends in an effort to outscore them by grabbing coins and jumping on enemies . You do n t compete directly against friends in Toad Rally , though . Rather , you compete against their previous records . As you dash through each timed course , you ll see a ghost of your friend s character competing the same run . The ghost player ca n t interact with you at all , but it does give you some extra incentive to get a move on . Nintendo has always had a problematic relationship with online gaming , but the company has really figured it out with Super Mario Run . To challenge a friend to a Toad Rally match , you can simply text or email them from the game . You can also lay down the gauntlet through Facebook and Twitter . The main objective of beating your friends in Toad Rally , beyond bragging rights , is to sway as many toads those mushroom hat-wearing guys that run around Mario s world to join your personal kingdom . Super Mario Run s Kingdom Builder lets you create your own Mario kingdom . The idea , Miyamoto said , was to give gamers the opportunity to create their own versions of the kingdom maps found in virtually every Mario game . From here you can purchase tiny mushroom houses for your toads , decorations such as giant bushes and trees and special rooms that unlock specific characters . Buying a Luigi house , for example , unlocks Mario s brother Luigi as a playable character . You can do the same to get a Yoshi hose , Mario s faithful dinosaur friend . Additional characters will be available to unlock , though Nintendo does n t want to spoil the surprise by telling us whom we can expect to see in the game . Super Mario Run is expected to be a huge hit for Nintendo , and Apple , when it hits the App Store Dec. 15 . According to Sensor Tower , the game could rake in as much as $ 71 million in its first month . That s a lot of coin . But when you take a look at the payment model for Super Mario Run , it s clear the Nintendo could have milked its fans for millions more if , instead of charging $ 9.99 up front , the company chose to go with a traditional free-to-play mobile model . Free-to-play games , like Candy Crush Saga , are free to download and play for a certain amount of time , but often push you to pay small fees to play longer or get special in-game items . Companies like Zynga and Supercell have used the free-to-play , or freemium , model for to varying degrees of success for years . Why did n t Nintendo do the same with Super Mario Run ? Because , as Miyamoto put it , Nintendo wanted to make sure a lot of people could play Mario Run by paying a little up front , rather than give few people the ability to play more by paying a lot over time . Miyamoto says he hopes the model catches on among consumers , as many companies are unable to fully recoup the development costs of their titles through free-to-play games , leaving just a small number of successful companies . Charging a set price , Miyamoto said , will also help parents , as they simply have to pay one time to get the full game and not have to worry about their kids spending hundreds of dollars on in-app purchases . If the success of Pok mon Go is any indication , Super Mario Run should prove to be a huge hit among both current fans , those looking for a trip down memory lane and newcomers alike .

		"paragraph": "A 60 Minutes interview with President Donald Trump airing Sunday promises severe punishment if it is proven that the Saudi Arabia government was behind the disappearance and presumed murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi . The Trump interview at the White House with Lesley Stahl touched on a number of subjects , including China , North Korea and his treatment of Christine Blasey Ford , the accuser of Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who almost derailed his nomination . The interview airs Sunday at 7:30 PM ET/PT on CBS . An initial clip of the interview saw Trump admitting the Saudis could be behind the disappearance of Khashoggi , a critic of the kingdom who entered the Istanbul consulate Oct. 2 and was not seen again . Last Friday , news broke that Turkish authorities claim they have tapes proving he was murdered , according to a Washington Post report . His disappearance has sparked worldwide outrage and led a number of prominent media companies and journalists to pull out of a planned major media conference set for Saudi Arabia later this month . A transcript of the Khashoggi talk was released by CBS : Stahl : Jamal Khashoggi , the journalist , the Saudi journalist . Was he murdered by the Saudis ? And did the prince give the order to kill him . Trump : Well , nobody knows yet , but we ll probably be able to find out . It s being investigated , it s being looked at very very strongly . And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case . As of this moment , they deny it and they deny it vehemently . Could it be them ? Yes . Stahl : Jared , your son-in-law , got on the phone and asked the prince . Did he deny it ? Trump : They deny it . They deny it every way you can imagine . In the not too distant future I think we ll know an answer . Stahl : What are your options ? Let s say , they did . What are your options ? Would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed ? Trump : Well , it depends on what the sanction is . I ll give you an example , they are ordering military equipment . Everybody in the world wanted that order . Russia wanted it , China wanted it , we wanted it . We got it , and we got all of it , every bit of it . Stahl : So would you cut that off ? Trump : Well I ll tell you what I do n t want to do . Boeing , Lockheed , Raytheon , I do n t want to hurt jobs . I do n t want to lose an order like that . And you know what , there are other ways of punishing , to use a word that s a pretty harsh word , but it s true . Stahl : Tell everybody what s at stake here . You know â€¦ Trump : Well there s a lot at stake , there s a lot at stake . And , maybe especially so because this man was a reporter . There s something you ll be surprised to hear me say that , there s something really terrible and disgusting about that if that was the case so we re going to have to see .

While Prince Harry was best man at the wedding , Prince William did n't have an official role , so it was less crucial for him to attend the nuptials . And even though the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expected to put in an appearance at the ceremony , they did n't make it to the event . According to Hello ! magazine , the reason that Kate and William missed the van Straubenzee wedding is likely because \" the couple may have always planned to shun the spotlight and slip into the reception later this evening . \" The publication cites their recent trip to Mustique as a possible reason for the no-show , noting that \" Harry and Meghan were always sure to attend , with the Prince 's best man duties a poorly kept secret . \" One of the reasons William and Kate were expected to attend the wedding is because Charlie van Straubenzee 's brother , Tom , is one of Princess Charlotte 's godparents . It 's also believed that both Charlie and Tom were members of the wedding party in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's wedding on May 19 . Clearly , the van Straubenzee 's are extremely close to several members of the royal family , but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge managed to avoid being photographed this weekend .

		"paragraph": "Police in Canada have told people to stop reporting their neighbours for growing cannabis after the country lifted a ban on the drug . Authorities in Toronto also urged the public not to report adults for smoking a joint as Canada becomes only the second nation in the world to fully legalise recreational use of marijuana . The city s police have launched an awareness campaign in a bid to prevent time-wasting calls as new laws come into force on Wednesday . This change represents a significant transition , not just for members of the Toronto Police Service but for all Canadians , said police chief Mark Saunders . Going forward it is important for everyone to take the time to educate themselves on legalisation . In a series of tweets , Toronto police urged people to no longer contact officers about your neighbour s pot plants , smelling weed from your neighbour s home , or an adult smoking a joint . Cannabis is no longer illegal , the posts said . Do not call police for this . Growing up to four cannabis plants will be allowed per household in Canada , which is the largest country in the world to legalise recreational use of the drug . Consumption will be legal anywhere where smoking is permitted except in motor vehicles for people aged 19 and above . Legalisation follows a decision by the Canadian parliament in the summer , when the Senate voted 52-29 in favour of the move . The lower chamber , the House of Commons , had voted in favour of the Bill C-45 , otherwise known as the Cannabis Act , the day before . Uruguay is the only other country to have fully legalised the drug . Canada s move towards legalisation marks the completion of a pledge made by Justin Trudeau during his victorious campaign for the premiership in 2015 . He argued criminalising the drug was ruining the lives of young people convicted of minor crimes such as possession and boosting organised criminal gangs . But while Canadian police are keen to stress cannabis use is no longer illegal , officers themselves have been advised to refrain from sparking up . Toronto police officers will be banned from serving on active duty within 28 days of consuming the drug . Mr Saunders said : The science we have relied upon warns us that cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can continue to affect a person s ability to make good decisions , concentrate , control impulses and rely on memory for up to several weeks after last use . Members need to rely on these very abilities every day . ",

		"paragraph": "WHAT MATTERED MOST A subjective ranking of the results that mattered most to the playoff bracket . 1 . Golden State Warriors 110 , San Antonio Spurs 98 Playoff seeds and berths ultimately matter most to the extent they determine a champion . So a game in which the team with the league s best record comes back from a 15-0 hole and 22-point deficit to dominate the second half against the team with the second-best record one night after controlling proceedings against the team with the third-best record ! is always going to show up near the top of this list . When that elite team also opens up a 3 1/2 - game lead for homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs with only seven left to play , they re going to get the top spot . [ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Baseball : Get in the game and join a league today ] Yes , the Warriors did all that in just 48 minutes . What looked like a banner night for San Antonio after just four minutes became something very different by halftime ( when the Warriors trailed by three points ) and turned around completely after a few possessions of the third quarter ( when the Warriors took the lead and went on to never trail again ) . The defense was great , the offense was nifty , and everyone from Stephen Curry to David West ( in the year 2017 ! ) looked like a potential playoff difference-maker . Oh , and Kevin Durant is still on track to play before the end of the regular season . The Spurs are still six games ahead of the Houston Rockets for the No. 2 seed , so they do n t have much to worry about when it comes to facing an acceptable playoff opponent . On the other hand , the Warriors tore apart Pau Gasol and David Lee in the pick-and-roll and could have exposed a severe matchup problem against any functional NBA offense . But maybe it s best not to worry about that now . We are here for explanations of playoff scenarios , not real basketballular analysis . 2 . Milwaukee Bucks 103 , Boston Celtics 100 The good news for the Celtics is that they re still in a virtual tie with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the East s top seed . The bad news is that they held sole possession of that No. 1 spot for all of two days and lost it by dropping a home game to the kind of squad they re going to have to handle to win a playoff series , let alone impress over several rounds . A solid night for Isaiah Thomas ( 32 points on 9-of-17 shooting ) could not overcome a 39.8 percent teamwide performance from the floor with 16 turnovers , and the Bucks shot 52.6 percent at the other end to keep up a steady stream of offense . Even then , the Celtics had a chance to tie on the last possession of the game , which ended in an off-balance , low-percentage miss for Marcus Smart . They could have had a chance to win with a two , but rookie guard Malcolm Brogdon knocked down this big jumper at the shot-clock buzzer to stretch the margin to three : That dagger capped off a stellar night for Brogdon , who finished with 16 points and nine assists . His play was part of an impressive showing for the Bucks , now winners of 13 of their last 16 games . The Bucks remain tied with the victorious Hawks ( who hold the tiebreaker via a 3-1 season series win ) and stuck in the No. 6 spot , but there s no question which squad looks like the tougher playoff opponent right now . Draw Milwaukee at your own risk . 3 . Oklahoma City Thunder 114 , Orlando Magic 106 ( OT ) With five minutes left in the third quarter , Orlando held a 21-point lead , stunning the Thunder behind the hot shooting of guard Evan Fournier and a sound enough defensive effort to hold OKC to just 37.7 percent shooting as a team . With 6:01 remaining in the fourth , the Magic held a 14-point lead , as swingman Terrence Ross had cranked up his shooting and the rest of the Thunder continued to struggle to get on track . And then Russell Westbrook happened , and nothing else mattered . Well , nothing else except what the win meant to OKC , officially our newest postseason participant . The sixth team in the Western Conference to clinch a playoff berth , the Thunder now sit at 43-31 , one game back of the Clippers , who beat the Wizards at Staples Center on Wednesday , in the race for the No. 5 spot in the Western Conference . The Magic fell to 27-48 , hanging onto their hold on the fourth-worst record in the NBA , and thus the fourth-best odds of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft . Tight game , Russ goes nuts , home crowd gets entertained and home team loses a real win-win-win-win in Central Florida ! 4 . Memphis Grizzlies 110 , Indiana Pacers 97 This result is n t going to help the ever-worsening mood around the Pacers . One day after Paul George called out his teammates for lacking winning pride , Indiana trailed 72-53 at the half and only made a cosmetic comeback after to make it four losses in its last five ( and they were n t world-beaters before then , either ) . But , hey , at least they re stuck with Lance Stephenson for three seasons . This particular defeat puts the Pacers under .500 at 37-38 , bad enough to drop them into the East s No. 8 spot via a lost 2-1 season series tiebreaker with the surging Heat . The Pacers are still 1 1/2 games up on the equally depressing Chicago Bulls , and at this point I do n t think anyone would complain if the East s top seed gets a bye in the first round . The Grizzlies are very likely headed for the West s No. 7 seed no matter what , but they at least ended a four-game losing streak and kept pace with the Clippers and Thunder ahead of them . Perhaps most importantly , they looked good doing it while Marc Gasol missed his third-straight game with a left foot strain . Mike Conley dominated with 36 points and seven three-pointers , and Vince Carter added 21 on only eight attempts from the field . 5 . Atlanta Hawks 99 , Philadelphia 76ers 92 What s the cure for what ails a team that has lost seven straight games to cast their playoff positioning in doubt ? Well , you ll be shocked to learn that it s Back-to-Back Matchups with Two of the Six Worst Teams in the NBA . After getting off the schneid against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday , the Hawks traveled to Philly and mostly took care of business , knocking off the Sixers behind a monster outing from center Dwight Howard : 22 points on 8-for-17 shooting , 20 rebounds , four assists and a blockin 36 minutes of work . The 76ers made an early fourth-quarter push , rolling up an 11-2 run to draw within two points , 83-81 , with just under 8 1/2 minutes left . But a big 3-pointer by Atlanta wing Tim Hardaway Jr. , a couple of stops , and some Howard free throws kept Philly at bay , and a driving layup by point guard Dennis Schr der with 1:44 remaining sealed the deal for the Hawks , who improved to 39-36 to stay in fifth place in the East , keeping pace with the also-victorious Milwaukee Bucks , over whom they own a 3-1 head-to-head tiebreaker . Atlanta got a big boost from the return of swingman Kent Bazemore , who had missed the previous five games with a bone bruise on his right knee and returned with a flourish against Philly . Baze knocked down six of 10 shots and four of five 3-point tries to score 19 points in 20 minutes , adding four rebounds , four assists , two steals and a block . Nice to have you back , dude . Now just get your friend Paul healthy , too , and maybe the Hawks might be able to make things interesting come the start of Round 1 . 6 . Los Angeles Clippers 133 , Washington Wizards 124 Why does a game between two confirmed playoff teams sit so low on this list ? Because both the win and loss merely allowed these squads to tread water in their seeding fights . The Clippers home victory allowed them to keep pace with the No. 4 Jazz ( 1 1/2 back , but with a tiebreaker ) and No. 6 Thunder ( one game ahead ) , but they re still stuck in the middle at No. 5 . Meanwhile , the Wizards defeat means they neither opened up more than their one-game lead over on the No. 4 Raptors nor closed any of their two-game gap behind the No. 2 Celtics . Also , boy , maybe reconsider planning on either of these teams to stop anyone in the playoffs . The Clips and Wizzies combined for 67 points in all but one quarter the fourth , when everyone must have been tired of running from end to end . We would list individual stat highlights , but how can you pick just one ? ( John Wall had 41 points in the loss . ) 7 . Miami Heat 105 , New York Knicks 88 Even without shooting guard Dion Waiters , who missed his sixth straight game as he continues to tend to a severely sprained left ankle , and even on the second night of a back-to-back after an emotional last-second win in Detroit , the Heat just had too much firepower for the circling-the-drain Knicks . Goran Dragic became the latest in a long , long , long line of opposing guards to torture New York s perimeter defenders , scoring 20 points with nine assists , seven rebounds and two steals . Ace reserve James Johnson continued to turn in his best Peak Spurs-Era Boris Diaw impression as a top ball-handling big man off the bench 18 points on 11 shots , seven rebounds , four assists , three steals and two blocks in 27 minutes to help pace the Heat , who improved to 37-38 and moved up to seventh place in the East by virtue of holding a 2-1 edge in the head-to-head tiebreaker over the slumping Indiana Pacers . [ Follow Ball Do n t Lie on social media : Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ] Miami s also just two games back of the Hawks and Bucks , owning the head-to-head advantage over Milwaukee and having split the season series with Atlanta , so it s possible the Heat are n t done climbing just yet . Left for dead amid injury and inconsistency somewhere after New Year s , Miami is now 26-8 since Jan. 15 , with the NBA s seventh-best offense and third-best defense in that span . Erik Spoelstra for president , or prime minister , or grand vizier of dark magicks . Whichever you prefer . 7 . Charlotte Hornets 110 , Toronto Raptors 106 Though they could n t have known it at the time , the Raptors could have drawn into a tie with the Wizards had they not given up 44 points in the fourth quarter and blown a six-point lead after three . The Hornets made eight three-pointers in the period and managed to keep their very slim playoff hopes alive . They re three games back of the No. 8 Pacers but would have to jump several teams to get there . Then again , there s always a chance that the Pacers , Bulls , and Pistons will decide its not worth it to slog through a few playoff games and forfeit the remainder of the season . One can hope ! 8 . Utah Jazz 112 , Sacramento Kings 82 Congrats to the host Kings , who dropped the first and fourth quarters by a combined 39 points to avoid the win . Utah can maybe look for areas to improve after making a terrible sandwich with amazing bread , but at least they got the win . They stay 1 1/2 games ahead of the Clippers for the No. 4 seed and its all important homecourt advantage in the first round . 9 . New Orleans Pelicans 121 , Dallas Mavericks 118 The Pelicans win was notable in that Anthony Davis ( 30 points and 13 points ) and DeMarcus Cousins ( 29 points , 16 rebounds , six assists ) both excelled at the same time , which is a good sign for their playoff prospects next season . Alas , they are still 4 1/2 games out the No. 8 spot with only seven left on their schedule . Still , we include them here , because this post is nothing if not comprehensive . MVP OF THE DAY A subjective choice for the player most valuable to his team , on just one day and determined by the NBA playoff picture . Look , this section exists so we can talk about big-time performances from players who are n t in the NBA MVP discussion . But what Russell Westbrook did on Wednesday means this bit ca n t go as planned . Nineteen points in the final 6:01 of the fourth for the NBA s most irrepressible force to erase the deficit and force overtime . Seven more , plus four rebounds and two assists , in the extra session . Another triple-double in a season full of them , and this one especially remarkable 57 points , the most in a triple-double in NBA history , to go with 13 rebounds and 11 assists to key the biggest comeback in Thunder franchise history , and to make Oklahoma City the sixth team in the West to clinch a playoff berth , and to add yet another set of highlights to an already-full-to-burstin MVP sizzle reel . THE MOMENT OF TRUTH A subjective choice for the most important play of the day as determined by all the same stuff listed in the last section . Yeah , sorry , we re going to talk about Westbrook again . The guy hit a 31-foot three-pointer to send his team s game to overtime . That s pretty damn important . We swear tomorrow s blurb will be about a crisp bounce pass . Dan Devine ( @yourmandevine ) also contributed to this post . Eric Freeman is a writer for Ball Do n t Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the Manna From Heaven episode of The People v. O.J. Simpson : American Crime Story contains spoilers . Assuming for a moment that you probably are n t a despicable racist , could you ever imagine sitting down and listening to 13 whole cassette tapes of Mark Fuhrman casually using the n-word several thousand times while bragging about beating up innocent black people ? That feels like a tall order for anybody , let alone people with consciences . One assumes that these tapes miiight ve included less horrible topics Mark Fuhrman s preferred food item at Wendy s or his favorite Seinfeld episodes perhaps ? but the worst and most disgusting parts of those tapes certainly overshadow everything else . Go ahead and label those tapes Bad Times and use a Sharpie . Depending on whether you sided with the defense or the prosecution in the O.J. Simpson trial , those tapes may have just been Manna From Heaven . In fact , that s what this week s episode was titled ! It s worth pointing out that in the Old Testament s version of events , the manna from Heaven did not involve so many uses of the n-word , at least not in any Bible I m familiar with . Yet here was Johnnie Cochran , praising the Lord for 13 cassette tapes worth of abject hate-speech . See , these were n t just recordings of a bad cop saying bad things , they were a confirmation of the darkest fears anyone s ever harbored toward law enforcement . So , uh , thanks , Mark Fuhrman ? Like , jump in a grave , but also thanks in a way ? Guys , this was a very upsetting episode of TV ! But sometimes necessary things are upsetting , and Manna From Heaven felt necessary and essential . Let s talk about it ! In a show ABOUT iconic moments of the â€˜ 90s , we began with perhaps the most iconic of icons : THE A CURRENT AFFAIR LOGO . You know that spinning pyramid and synth whiplash sound-effect , it is seared into your memory . And on this particular segment , courtroom O.J. was pretending to be too arthritic to be a double murderer even though he d filmed an aerobics video two weeks prior : Man , journalism has never been the same since A Current Affair went off the air . Bring it back ! Anyway , this TV was owned by the woman who d made the infamous Mark Fuhrman tapes . She was played by the girl from Wet Hot American Summer and she d been a failed screenwriter who d once interviewed Fuhrman for 13 hours about what it s like to be a total piece of s t ( plus also cop stuff ) . Even though we did n t see her much after her initial outreach to the Simpson tip hotline , I have to call into question ANYBODY who would willingly hang out with Mark Fuhrman after even the FIRST time he dropped the n-word . What was this lady s problem ? The episode did n t really get into it . Just to set the tone for what had been going on in the courtroom at the time the tapes were brought to light , a witness who d once claimed to have heard the raised voice of a black man arguing with another man shortly before the murders ended up getting almost completely overshadowed when Chris Darden and Johnnie Cochran began shouting at each other about whether or not such a claim was racist . Like , obviously it was kind of racist , sure , but this WAS first-person testimony and all the biases that implies . The scene ended up being very illustrative of the two sides opposing objectives : The prosecution wanted to keep things limited and factual while the defense wanted to turn the whole thing into a larger referendum about systemic racism in the criminal justice system . In other words , it was all just A LOT . So this was why the Defense seemed particularly , uh , stoked that the tapes existed . Because racism in the LAPD just seemed A LOT more verifiable now . But obtaining these tapes would not be easy ! Johnnie Cochran and F. Lee Bailey would have to travel to North Carolina and convince the local legal system that the tapes were important to their case . But as you might guess from a state that litters its courtyards with statues of Confederate soldiers and plasters its courtrooms with murals of Confederate flags , Johnnie Cochran s flair did n t quite go over so well . Honestly I m not sure if I bought this scene . For someone so savvy about racial politics in the courtroom , how did Johnnie Cochran honestly believe that he d be better at arguing a case in the South than F. Lee Bailey , who resembles Colonel Sanders drunk uncle ? Get real . Fortunately F. Lee Bailey was especially good at laying it on thick , like when he spent about 10 minutes quoting scripture and using dog whistle phrases that amounted to basically the South will rise again . And so , before we knew it , the lawyers were granted full access to 13 tapes of Mark Fuhrman talking about planting evidence and occasionally beating innocent minorities nearly to death ! Let the good times roll . If this episode was any indication , the full contents of the tapes were truly stomach churning . There s been some speculation and even suggestion by Fuhrman himself that he was talking â€˜ in character to some extent , or at least exaggerating his claims and using racist language in order to embody a worst-case-scenario cop . But uh , no thank you to that excuse . There was no excuse for this , and the quick montage of everybody listening to it looking like they wanted to vom was a pretty big sign that Fuhrman was actual human garbage . Worse , he seemed to validate every assumption people have ever held about police corruption , and this was an especially bad time for that . But putting aside all the hateful , racist claims in these tapes ( if such a thing were truly possible ) , probably the wildest moment in the recordings was when Mark Fuhrman began actively slagging Judge Ito s WIFE , a female police officer ( and superior ) about whom he had particularly nasty things to say . Insane ! Now , this episode did n t really mess around with this : Judge Ito and his wife were straight-up corrupt in their handling of this situation . She had obviously lied when she signed the affidavit claiming she d never met Fuhrman , and this was probably because she d just wanted her husband to attain the fame he was now experiencing via hilarious Jay Leno bits and signed Arsenio Hall headshots . But even when this conflict was discovered , Judge Ito clearly did n t want to declare a mistrial or remove himself from the bench , so he kinda bent over backward to let other judges give him the go ahead to stay on the case . The whole thing was a mess and nobody looked good . A mistrial was honestly very deserved in this case , but nobody wanted to pull that trigger I guess . Both sides were feeling tons of turmoil over the tapes themselves , as evidenced by back-to-back scenes in which everyone shouted at each other in elevators . Shapiro was still super steamed that his beloved Los Angeles had become a hotbed of racial animosity , and Chris Darden was just really ticked at Marcia Clark for not having listened to him when he d advised her that Fuhrman was Bad News . Fortunately they were able to kinda come together during another very stressful and upsetting scene in which Darden lost his temper toward Judge Ito . Ito had just ruled that the defense should be allowed to present the tapes to the Court ( without the jury present ) just â€˜ cuz . So Darden started shouting at everybody until Judge Ito threatened him with jail time . But the best was when Darden requested that his lawyer speak for him , and then Marcia Clark stood up and began yelling at everybody also ! They were like Bonnie & Clyde â€˜ 95 up there ! And when Ito began threatening HER with jail time she replied , Should I take off my jewelry ? like a BOSS . Anyway , everything ended up getting sorted out and apologies were exchanged , but the prosecution s passion definitely shifted our sympathies back toward them . Nobody can deny there d been a need for America to deal with racism and corruption in the legal system , but in attempting to make that happen during THIS case , Johnnie Cochran had now totally destroyed the chances for a fair outcome . Like , we all know what that outcome will end up being , but at least from a character standpoint , it was nice to see Chris and Marcia finally make up again . At least there was that . Ultimately Judge Ito decided that the jury should only hear two snippets of Mark Fuhrman s racism , pretty much only to prove that he d committed perjury when he claimed he d never said the n-word . It was a lose-lose scenario for everyone except Judge Ito , who could now claim he never hid any evidence from the public ( who by now had been stoked by Johnnie Cochran into demanding the tapes release ) . But again , typical of this show , we were then presented with a quietly compelling scene between Johnnie and his wife in which our sympathies again returned to Cochran and his wish to shine a light on police racism and corruption . He may have failed to get the full and brutal truth of the tapes out into the world , but at least everyone knew it was realer than they d imagined . Finally the time came for Mark Fuhrman to take the stand again , and he arrived at the courthouse greeted by a hundred angry protesters and also 100 % of everyone in the courtroom staring DAGGERS at him . Seriously , a slow-motion montage of everyone mad-dogging him , and that alone was pretty satisfying . [ Hey , quick shout-out to Steven Pasquale for agreeing to play one of the most irredeemably loathsome TV characters in history ! Like , just having to record his voice for some of those excerpts must have been a real day-ruiner . Respect , sir . ] Anyway , in this scene Fuhrman got on the stand and repeatedly pled the Fifth for every question . Seeing an opening , Cochran asked Fuhrman whether he d planted evidence , and because Fuhrman could n t budge from his tactic he pled the Fifth again , which we all know is shady as hell and implies yes . So that was a smart move on the defense s part , credit where credit s due . Now everyone knew that Mark Fuhrman was both a racist and had possibly planted evidence in this case . THIS GUY was still pretty bummed about everything though . Yet another hard-won victory that threatened to lead to an actual travesty . Robert Kardashian , we feel you . But this episode was n t just shouting and n-words . It ended with a slightly positive thing ! Marcia Clark won full custody of her kids . A clerk joked that in getting full custody , she d gotten everything . That was a cute sentiment , but I m pretty sure Marcia would also liked to have won a Trial of the Century . Just my opinion ! Manna From Heaven was an unflinching and sometimes disturbing hour of television , but like the original conversation surrounding this case , it felt essential and even cathartic . Sometimes there s no right time to broach important topics , and that even includes within the context of a murder trial . Let s not mess around here , a murderer got away with it . But one hopes that the ripple effect from the Dream Team s tactics and the renewed awareness of racist cronyism within the ranks of law enforcement had SOME benefit to society . I guess at this point we d have to think this just to sleep at night . But the beauty of The People v. O.J. Simpson is that there was no correct answer here and it does n t claim to offer one . What it does offer is insight and humanity wherever the camera s pointed . And that ll always be valuable to us . What did YOU think of Manna From Heaven ? The People v. O.J. Simpson : American Crime Story airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on FX .",

According to a new study published November 6 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , using the words really or incredibly reveal your stress levels . According to Nature , researchers wanted to analyze the biology of people whose physical heath was affected by negative factors such as poverty or social isolation to provide insight into the body s evolutionary response to a threat . However , due to a disconnect between how people described their anxiety and how their bodies reacted to it , scientists turned to speech for clarity . After wiring up 143 people to audio recorders for two days , scientists noted which function words words that pop out without much thought were used during times of stress . Yahoo Lifestyle could not reach study co-author Matthias Mehl of the University of Arizona for comment however , he told Nature , By themselves they do n t have any meaning , but they clarify what s going on . Researchers determined that those under stress not only talk less , but they also often use words such as really , incredibly , certainly , and very . What s so obvious about these buzzwords ? Mehl told Nature they act as emotional intensifiers and indicate that our bodies are in a heightened state .

		"paragraph": "A few months ago , I noticed I felt more sluggish than usual when it came to using the bathroom . Let me be frank : Things were not smooth sailing with my bowels . After getting firsthand feedback and doing research , all roads led me to getting my first colonic . It literally turned my poopless situation into a better , plentiful one that I m so happy I had the chance to experience . One of my best friends told me her mother had a colonic , also known as colon hydrotherapy , and that it instantly made her feel lighter and all kinds of amazing . Obviously I was all ears , and asked if she could share more details , because I was eager and sort of desperate . Her mom put me in touch with certified hydrocolon therapist Tsila Trager of Alist Wellness Center . Trager briefly explained to me that a colonic is a body detox in which water is introduced through the inner colon area to cleanse the colon of built-up leftover waste , help improve digestion , and encourage overall wellness . I took it a step further and checked out her website , as well as a few other sources , and the treatment seemed legit . I figured what s the worst that could happen and booked a Saturday morning appointment . YOLO ! To prep for my colonic , Trager instructed me to drink at least one gallon of water the day before my scheduled procedure and to eat healthy , nourishing foods . She also advised that any eating be done two to four hours before my colonic to help me get the most out of my session . I did n t accomplish drinking a full gallon of water , so I freaked out the night before and contacted her to see if I should reschedule . She calmly told me it was OK and strongly suggested I still come in . While on my way to the wellness center , I was n t really sure what to expect , but I did think it would probably be a little stinky , so I mentally prepared for that . Once inside the small , spotless lobby , I was surprised by the fresh , crisp-smelling air . A voice called out , Hello , and a fair-skinned woman about 5 feet tall with glowing skin and brunette hair tucked into a bun appeared . It was Trager . She smiled and sat down with me to talk about how I was feeling and what to expect . I filled out some paperwork , and we headed back to one of the treatment rooms , where it all literally goes down . Inside the room , there was a television , a bed with a middle opening for what looked like a drain , and the colon hydrotherapy system . Trager told me to undress , slip into a gown , and insert the connected speculum about two inches into my rectum . She left the room , and I did just that . Well , I thought so . Trager resurfaced and turned the water on to start flushing out my colon . She noticed something seemed a little off and told me I had to push the speculum up farther because it was barely inserted . I did n t experience any pain , but I think I was just nervous . Embarrassingly , the therapist had to help me out a bit . Bless her heart . Then she turned the water on again and told me whenever I felt like I needed to release just let everything go . With her standing there , I think more nerves kicked in . For the first 15 minutes nothing really happened . We just saw streams of cloudy water run through the connected tube . Seems like Trager could read my mind , so she left the room so I could relax better . Still nothing . At this point , I felt lost . What did I need to do in order to get a freakin bowel movement ?! I had never been so anxious to go No. 2 in my life . Strangely , once she walked back in to check on me , waste started to fall through . Trager took a glance up at me and said in the nicest way possible , You really need to increase the amount of water and fiber you take in . There should be much more than this . That was the first wake-up call of many from this experience . The process went on for about 45 minutes , and Trager told me to try sitting up throughout the procedure , as gravity will help pull everything down and out . Once she cut the water off , I slid up off the speculum , freshened up with cleansing wipes , and proceeded to the center s main office to discuss next steps . There was a small cup of water and a probiotic supplement set up for me to consume after the treatment . Trager reiterated that I needed a stronger balance of water and fiber in my diet . It was like a bell went off in my head , and I realized I really need to make some serious lifestyle changes . Apparently , my poop proved that . Trager pleasantly sent me off with some fresh lemongrass and herbal tea bags to help keep my system moving . She also suggested that my follow-up diet consist of mostly healthy fluids ( distilled water , juices , electrolyte liquids , etc. ) and recommended avoiding raw vegetables and flesh consumption ( i.e. , beef , pork , chicken ) . I walked out of the wellness center feeling like a brand-new woman . Once I was back in my car , I took a peek in my dashboard mirror and immediately noticed my skin looked tighter and more luminous . I just so happened to have Rihanna s Fenty Beauty Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter on hand in my pocketbook , and I swiped it along my cheekbone to amplify the glow . I showed my look off on Insta Stories and received lots questions from my followers , who wanted to know more about my skin care routine . Post-procedure , and being the curious person that I am , I naturally wanted to learn more from Trager . At this point , I felt like she was my trusted poop whisperer . I called her up to chat and make sure I stayed on track . When I asked how many times a day I should go , she said , Roughly two to three times a day is normal because the stomach should be emptying every two to four hours . Depending on how many meals you eat , you should always be going after . When it came to questions about color and smell , she explained , Sometimes the bowel movement is way too dark . That also shows that the acid level is probably just way too high , which means there is a lack of fiber . Typically , if someone has an olive color , not a leafy color , but more of a deep-green olive color , you can see that they really have a good pH balance . During our follow-up conversation , Trager also pointed out that if I am a heavy meat eater , I will continue to have a harder time in the bathroom . She added , Meat is harder to digest in your system , and leads to heavier bowel movements that are hard to release and have really foul odors . Alternatively , with a plant-based diet , you will have an easier time with bowel movements that are lighter and float to the top of the water in the toilet . The benefits of colon hydrotherapy may include assisting with treatment of mild skin conditions such as dryness and acne , as well as ridding your body of constipation . It can also serve as an aid in weight loss because you are clearing the body of anything that could be adding extra unnecessary mass to your body . The stream of water inserted during the process definitely will give you the boost needed to get going . Trager says it best : Just like any plant , if you are not watering it , it s not going to grow good . The body is just like that . When you start making these changes , it promotes healthy cells and the body starts rejuvenating itself .

		"paragraph": "We ve written a lot about how Donald Trump s election win is boosting business and consumer confidence . And now we ve got another segment of the economy getting a lift from Trump s win : private jets . In its latest survey of the business jet market , UBS aerospace team led by the David Strauss found its overall Business Jet Market Index hit 53 , 5 % better than its last survey and the fifth straight improvement for the reading . But the biggest standout areas of the survey were , like the broader economic data we ve been tracking , in the expectations and outlook responses . UBS customer interest score hit 78 in February , the highest since January 2005 . Sixty percent of the 153 respondents from UBS survey indicated that customer interest had improved since its last survey while just 3 % said interest had declined . In January , 55 % of respondents said customer interest had improved . Additionally , 65 % of respondents indicated that they expect the election to positive impact the market , though this is slightly less than the 72 % who expected a positive impact in UBS last survey . Some of this optimism , however , is beginning to trickle into actual action from jet buyers or leasers . In terms of validating this optimism , UBS writes , 49 % have seen an increase in transactions since the election while only 5 % have seen lower volumes . Now , this survey comes amid a private jet market that is still not in great shape , as UBS notes there exists an inventory overhang and weak utilization . And as one professional in the market told UBS , Trump Bump has given way to â€˜ wait and see will there be a trade war ? Will there be an import tax ? Will manufacturing have to restructure ? With any uncertainty in the overall economy or political environment , aircraft owners choose to wait . Expect to see pick up in sales late this year once we understand what a Trump government will look and act like . Perhaps not unexpectedly , then , the business jet market sounds a lot like the tension we re seeing in markets between investors and analysts . Last week , for the first time we saw some of this increased confidence turning into increased spending . And while improving spending from consumers , and increased investment from businesses , are the sorts of trends that underwrite improvements in actual economic performance , better private jet markets probably wo n t make any difference on Main Street .

		"paragraph": "The beginning of April signals prom season for most high schoolers , where the anxiety of finding dresses , suits , and dates starts to kick in . But 19-year-old Adrienne is warning teens to be cautious of another unexpected outcome that can come from prom night . Taking to Twitter to post photos from her own senior prom in April 2017 , the teen shows followers how cute and carefree her and boyfriend Devyn were while exchanging corsages . However , the second set of photos flashes forward nine months to when the couple was introduced to a whole new world of responsibilities when they welcomed their baby girl . It s April and officially prom season , Adrienne tweeted alongside the photos . So remember , if you are n t careful things can go from cute pictures with your prom date , to 9 months later needing a babysitter when you guys go on a date . The cautionary tale from Adrienne reflects her own experience as a then 18-year-old teen , who , despite being on birth control at the time , became pregnant on prom night . Explaining to Yahoo Lifestyle that she and Devyn had begun dating in October of her junior year , Adrienne says that her boyfriend joined the Marine Corps soon after in January 2016 , and was stationed in California that summer . Since then , they d been in a long-distance relationship , seeing each other only three to four times a year . When he made it home for her senior prom , it was sure to be something special . Still , the couple could never have guessed how life-altering the evening would become . Prom was April 22nd , and I found out that I was pregnant May 6th , Adrienne says . I was 18 when I found out , and when I had her . I was in theater throughout my high school years , and it was actually the morning of dress rehearsal for The Wizard of Oz . I took a pregnancy test in the bathroom of the high school , painted green and dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West . The pregnancy test came out positive , but Adrienne could n t believe it . She took two more tests a few days later to ensure that it was correct , but did n t tell anyone until a week later . Devyn was training for his deployment at the time , so he was in the field when I found out , she says . I did n t tell anyone at all until I could talk to him a week later . That was definitely the longest week of my life . Although Devyn was immediately thrilled to hear the news from his girlfriend , Adrienne admits to having to take time to process it as did others in her conservative community . He was my first boyfriend and no one thought I would ever be a teen mom . I did n t fit the stereotype that most people have , she explains . It took a few weeks before we told our parents , then we waited until after graduation and I was out of my first trimester to publicly announce . It was rough because I am from a small conservative area , and there was a lot of backlash since we are n t married . However , this was a little unexpected blessing from God . Through a thread on her Twitter account , Adrienne tells the story of her relationship with Devyn , eventually sharing the highs and lows of pregnancy . These nine months included taking a hard look at many of her relationships a process that she explains on her social media account in addition to reevaluating her own beliefs . Feeling as though she and her boyfriend had sinned for having a child out of wedlock , it took time to be able to become excited for this new chapter of her life . Yet the presumed impossibility of her getting pregnant to begin with made the miracle that much sweeter . Despite my doctor s saying I could n t get pregnant and being on birth control , we got to share the news of our little miracle , Adrienne wrote on Twitter of their announcement . Adrienne has polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , which causes a hormonal imbalance . While she was on the pill and taking it correctly she believed birth control would prevent pregnancy . However , she says it ended up leveling her hormones to a point that actually made it easier for her to become pregnant . As a result of her PCOS , Adrienne also had to take hormonal supplements during pregnancy . And once her baby girl was born , on January 17 , the many signs that she was a blessing went into the consideration of her name . Her name is Delayla and it means â€˜ morning sun , Adrienne says of her nearly 4-month-old daughter . It s after the verse Psalm 30:5 . Even though we sinned , God s anger only lasts a moment , and his favor lasts a lifetime . And we are getting a lifelong reminder of his grace . My pregnancy was so rough , losing friendships I thought I had , but the joy in the morning was her arrival . Thus , why her name is â€˜ morning light . Hardships continue for both Adrienne and Devyn , as the Marine is still 2,000 miles away from his girlfriend and baby girl . However , the couple has already made plans to get married once Adrienne gets her degree from Ball State University . I should be graduating the end of 2019 , and Devyn plans to reenlist , Adrienne says . So hopefully when I finish my degree , we ll get married , and the three of us will move wherever he gets stationed next . As for those headed for prom in the coming weeks , Adrienne urges them ( and all teens ) to use a secondary contraceptive . No birth control is 100 percent effective , she notes , and you do n t know if yours does n t work until a pregnancy happens .

		"paragraph": "In yet another example of how cellphones and social media create viral media moments , the video of a passenger being dragged off a United Airlines flight Sunday turned the luckless passenger into a kind of TV star . It was the perfect Monday-morning news story , a welcome contrast for harried TV news producers looking to provide information other than discussions about President Trump s Syrian airstrikes and the Republican trick confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch . The cellphone camera captured drama showed security personnel dragging the passenger off the United flight , the sight of his limp body provoking some halfhearted , Aw , come on ! protests from passengers that s the 21st century equivalent of the more appropriate scold : For shame ! The subtle co-star in this now-famous scene is the woman who can heard heard yelling , Oh my God ! over and over she sets the tone for how we are to react when viewing the video . Which is not how some have reacted . On Monday night , Bill O Reilly played the scene on The O Reilly Factor and laughed . I know I should n t be laughing , but it s so bizarre , said O Reilly , who probably has n t seen coach seating since 1980 . Because this is Fox News , I would not be at all surprised if the channel is hard at work doing some aggressive reporting to try to find some reason the passenger is actually to blame for the incident . To be fair , O Reilly was n t alone in finding something giggle-able about the scene . Some members of Jimmy Kimmel s audience also laughed when the host played the tape on his show . Interesting to hear some people laughing , a dismayed Kimmel said . Kimmel had the story to himself Colbert , Fallon , and Meyers are doing reruns this week and he made the most of it , zeroing in on the statement issued by United CEO Oscar Munez , who apologized for having to re-accommodate these customers which Kimmel characterized as sanitized , say-nothing , take-no-responsibility , corporate BS-speak . I do n t know how the guy who wrote that did n t vomit when he typed it out . Remember the airline s old slogan , Fly the friendly skies of United ? It is now to be replaced by Kimmel s sketch suggestion , which featured a smiling flight attendant in a United uniform cooing , United Airlines : F *** You .

		"paragraph": "Think back to your middle-school and high-school days . Now imagine if there had been a super-easy way to learn everything you wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask . Well now , of course , there s an app for just that . It s called Real Talk , and it s setting out to change the game when it comes sex ed and technology . Even though teen pregnancy rates are declining and at an all-time low , in rural populations , rates are still on the rise , or high , compared with the national average and compared with suburban and urban communities , co-founder Liz Chen tells Yahoo Lifestyle , explaining how the app is meant to make a difference . The app s three co-founders Chen , Cristina Leos , and Vichi Jagannathan met at various points in their schooling . Chen and Jagannathan were undergrads together at Princeton and both went on to do Teach for America in rural North Carolina , while Chen then went on to pursue her PhD in health behavior and met Stanford alum Leos in her doctoral program . Jagannathan , meanwhile , went on to obtain her MBA from Yale . All three women shared a commitment to making health information more accessible to young people and joined forces to help make their vision a reality . Chen notes that while she and Jagannathan were both doing Teach for America , they learned that sex education , though state-mandated in many places , was often still not taught in schools . Many students have already initiated sex by the time they enter high school , says Chen , which is why she , Jagannthan , and Leos decided to team up and apply for the Innovation Next incubator through the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy to refine their idea of mobile sex ed . Innovation Next selects five teams a year to be awarded an $ 80,000 grant and five months to prototype and explore their ideas for how to use technology to help prevent teen pregnancy . Support comes , along the way , from the National Campaign and designers from the firm IDEO . The really innovative thing about the program is that you get to set your own assumptions aside and work really closely with middle-school students themselves , Leos says of the experience . We spent time just really getting to know middle-school students and presenting them with different possible solutions . Based on their feedback week to week , we were able to see their reaction . Their feedback helped to shape the app , which , when it is first opened by a user , provides a short tutorial , followed by a feed of stories with brief previews . Clicking on one reveals a series of chat bubbles , providing each new line of text to mimic a personal text message . Scrolling through to read the full text conversation leads to links for high-quality sex-ed resources like Planned Parenthood and Amaze so that if a student wants to learn more about a subject , a link to how to get more in-depth on that topic in a credible way is literally right at their fingertips . All the content is generated by actual teenagers on Real Talk , whose team does minimal editing and presents stories , on topics from sex to relationships , in teens own words . Since November s beta launch in the App Store , almost 800 young people have downloaded the app , with some starting to contribute stories of their own . Leos adds that a priceless takeaway of their middle-school focus groups has been to give users what they want , including to know others are going through the same awkward , puberty-related moments that they were going through . What makes Real Talk special , then , Jagannathan emphasizes , is that from the eyes of a user , it s not a sex-ed app . When users look at it , it tells them that everyone is going through the same things they re going through and that they re not alone . Echoes Leos , One of the big differentiators is that we are centered around stories . Teens told us time and time again , â€˜ We do n t want adults telling us facts . And that resonated with us and that s why we ended up with a storytelling approach from peers . Clearly , what the Real Talk team is doing has struck a chord : The co-founders were not only named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Social Entrepreneurs but have also garnered glowing praise in the press from outlets as varied as Vice s Broadly and Fast Company to NPR s iconic quiz show Wait , Wait â€¦ Do n t Tell Me . Over and over again , Real Talk is being applauded for the way it s bringing sex ed to teens in a uniquely accessible way and at a time when it s needed most . Another hope is that the information is reaching locales where it s needed most , no matter their zip code . Another major concern that we are also trying to address is the issue of information equity and the people who have access to sex ed , says Leos . We know that a lot of the communities we work with do n t have access to adequate education in this realm , even in places like North Carolina , where schools are required to offer sex ed . Adds Chen : One thing that we have heard from parents is â€˜ Oh , someone else can do it when it comes to talking to their kids about sex and relationships . So parents often feel like they do n t need to do it because the school will do it . But then the schools says , â€˜ Oh , even if a teacher does n t feel comfortable teaching this material , it s OK because parents will do it at home . This dynamic , Chen explains , created a reality that when it comes to health information , there is no way to really hold adults accountable . And the political climate and religiosity of some communities makes it really difficult for teens to seek out other trusted adults for this information . Which again is where Real Talk offers a subtle solution , using peer stories as a conduit to reputable resources and credible facts . I would want teachers and parents to know that this is n t intended to replace them , Chen emphasizes . We re not trying to replace anything but are an added tool for things that teens may not have in terms of access . If you do n t have any access , here s a starting point . If you do , this is a great complement to the information you re already getting . And Jagannathan adds that adults should be aware that a quality complementary app like Real Talk can be critical to keeping kids not just informed but safe . Something we hear a lot related to this technology from teens is that when they have questions about growing up and experiences with their bodies , they search the internet to get those answers . The reality is in this day and age , the internet is thought of as the solution for kids . We want Real Talk to be the place kids end up versus other places , like pornography or other unreliable sources of information . Everyone would prefer they land at a place that s safe , credible , real , and engaging that s providing information they re already out there looking for . Or as Leos puts it , I want kids to know that it is OK to experience those weird and uncomfortable moments . It s OK to talk about it . It s OK to ask questions . And we want to be a resource to help make that possible .

The two have know each other since she was a contestant on American Idol , and he was already a successful producer in his 50s . Foster made one of several appearances as a mentor on the singing-competition show during an episode that aired in April 2006 , when McPhee sang I Have Nothing , a hit for Whitney Houston co-written by Foster . He and McPhee , who finished as runner-up , obviously hit it off , because they returned to the Idol stage to perform together two seasons later , and McPhee was one of the artists who sang for Foster at a 2008 PBS concert honoring his storied career . He worked with her on songs too . But rumors of their romance did n t really surface until last year , when they were regularly seen by each other s side .

Here s a breakdown of the pair s romance since they were first spotted out together . May 12 , 2017 : McPhee and Foster are seen dining together at celeb hot spot Nobu in Malibu , Calif. and it s beyond a friendly dinner .

		"paragraph": "New York Comic Con attendees got a first look on Saturday at a new preview of The Walking Dead Season 7 premiere , and the intense clip may just change a few theories on all the damage new baddie Negan unleashes on Rick Grimes and his group . The video begins immediately after the brutal , and oh-so-gory , murder by Negan of a member of Rick s group . We know , because when Negan shoves the bat in Rick s face , it s still dropping with the blood of â€¦ someone . I m gon na kill you , a devastated Rick calmly promises Negan . Not today , not tomorrow â€¦ but I m gon na kill you . Related : See â€˜ The Walking Dead Season 7 Photos Negan is n t afraid of Rick , though . In fact , he takes the opportunity to toy with him even further in a scene that features Emmy-caliber performances by both Andrew Lincoln and Jeffrey Dean Morgan . Negan talks about his right-hand man , and guesses that maybe he just killed Rick s . Maybe he just killed Rick s right-hand man â€¦ is that a clue about the first victim of Negan and Lucille ? Is it definitely a male character ? Other possible clues about the Negan-caused devastation in the Season 7 premiere : * There s a blood splatter on the right side of Rick s face , which likely means Negan ( and Lucille s ) victim ( or victims ) was to Rick s right . Those who are situated to his right in the semicircle of doom : Maggie , Abraham , Michonne , Daryl , Rosita , and Glenn . * After procuring a hatchet from his right-hand man , Negan drags Rick like a rag doll to his camper . While most fans feel certain Rick is n t killed in the premiere , that does n t mean all his body parts remain intact . In one of The Walking Dead comic book s most iconic Rick moments , he loses his hand when The Governor cuts it off ( in issue 28 ) . Cast and crew of the show have always maintained it would be tough to have Rick lose his hand in the series because of the CGI work that would be necessary to pull that off with an action-prone leading man , but a ) they figured out how to make Hershel s MIA leg work in Season 3 , and b ) they figured out how to make a CGI tiger Ezekiel s Shiva for Season 7 , so maybe Rick s appendage is n t safe after all . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead : Michael Cudlitz on Abraham s Love Life , Bisquick Food Drives , and Spoiler Hounds * Listen to the audio carefully . When Negan is talking to Simon , the aforementioned right-hand man , about the ax , he says , What d he have , a knife ? He had a hatchet , Simon says . A little later , Negan tells Simon , Sure , give me his ax . Whose ax/hatchet ? Who is the he they are referring to ? Is he the person who was just slaughtered by Negan ? Is that then confirmation that the victim is a he , and therefore definitely not Maggie ( who was to Rick s immediate right ) , Michonne , or Rosita ? * A pan down to the ground after Negan tosses Rick into his camper reveals a blanket , a huge bloody mess , and other pieces of what we assume is human remains . Let s not focus on that last part , and instead focus on the blanket â€¦ in the Season 6 finale , Daryl had a blanket wrapped around him . * During the NYCC panel , after EP/director/special effects expert Greg Nicotero mentioned the Season 7 finale will be the series 99th episode , star Lauren Cohan became very emotional . Understandably , she could simply have been reacting to the accomplishment of the close-knit cast in making to nearly 100 episodes . Or perhaps she s thinking about the character who dies in the premiere â€¦ who could be someone very close to her Maggie ? Of course , with , mercifully , just two weeks left until the season premiere , and what showrunner Scott Gimple promised during the NYCC TWD panel will be the reveal of who Negan killed , these could all be red herrings meant to help fans wile away the time until at least one of the most beloved members of Rick s post-apocalyptic family is no more . The Walking Dead Season 7 premieres Oct. 23 at 9 p.m. on AMC . ",

Jenner and Scott may not have been together for too long , but it looks like they could n t be happier to be parents . Scott gave Jenner a Ferrari as a push present , and they ve both shared plenty of cute photos of the baby on their social media accounts . Still , the new parents have kept their own relationship out of the public eye , for the most part . They are n t often seen engaging in PDA , like their kiss at the Astroworld listening party . Jenner told GQ in July that the two of them go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private . Astroworld was released on Friday , and fans are already speculating about which of Scott s songs could be about Jenner and Stormi . There s one line in Scott s song Stargazing that seems to be a reference to Jenner , when the rapper says his baby mama is a trophy . And other songs could be about Jenner and their 6-month-old daughter too . Jenner also showed her support for Scott s work by posting a photo of herself in an Astroworld T-shirt . Astroworld just dropped and it s the craziest ride of my life , the lip kit mogul wrote in her Instagram caption . Jenner is one of the most famous people in the world , and it s refreshing to hear that she s working to keep her relationship out of the spotlight .

De esa experiencia , Corley sac varias conclusiones , adem s del basamento para sus libros Rich Habits : The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals , Rich Kids : How to Raise Our Kids to Be Happy and Successful in Life y Change Your Habits , Change Your Life . Entre los detalles bastante singulares que definen a las personas acaudaladas , el investigador ha insistido desde entonces en un punto : la aversi n que los ricos sienten por personas pesimistas , y la tendencia que dejan entrever hacia personas orientadas hacia objetivos concretos , gente optimista y entusiasta , con una perspectiva de vida positiva . Art culo relacionado que te puede interesar : Aqu viven las personas m s ricas del mundo La raz n de esta actitud se fundamenta de esta manera : Corley est convencido de que las personas m s ricas del planeta creen que el xito solo se consigue si se posee o se adquiere un pensamiento y una actitud positiva . Del otro lado de la orilla solo hay personas negativas , escenarios tristes , gente t xica â€¦ De manera que el peor enemigo de un rico resulta ser el ap tico , el pesimista , el ser negativo por excelencia . Dinero llama a dinero Como se ha ocupado de mostrar la literatura y el cine , las personas acaudaladas solo se juntan con sus semejantes . Cualquier aproximaci n de alguien proveniente de otro estrato o con otra condici n financiera ser siempre observada con suspicacia . La gente exitosa da suerte - insisten , y el xito llama al xito . De ah que las relaciones sociales entre los ricos est n sustentadas por un elemento que parece ser menos importante : el optimismo . Los ricos son conscientes de que sus amistades podr an tener un impacto importante en el valor neto de su riqueza , asegura Kathleen Elkins para Business Insider . Adem s de mantener sus negocios en perfecta salud , las grandes fortunas exigen a los otros y se exigen a s mismos conservar un estado de nimo siempre exaltado , siempre tendiente al optimismo y a la b squeda de la felicidad . Pero , es m s , no pocos millonarios est n convencidos de que , gracias a ese temperamento , en ellos mismos o en sus antepasados , fue que lograron amasar la fortuna de la que hoy disfrutan . Porque , junto al esfuerzo continuado y al tes n , el tercer elemento que los llev a enriquecerse ha sido el car cter positivo en la vida . Es por ello que el pesimista , el personaje gris , es autom ticamente excluido del entorno de los ricos . Los millonarios son muy particulares en sus relaciones sociales - sostiene Corley - . Con frecuencia van con personas con el mismo nivel econ mico que ellos , y siempre buscan amistad con individuos que est n orientados a sus mismos objetivos , que sean optimistas , entusiastas y que tengan una perspectiva mental positiva en general . La importancia de las relaciones sociales De acuerdo con los datos acumulados por este investigador , el 86 % de la gente rica mantiene el h bito de relacionarse con personas de xito o con ideas que puedan conducirlas al triunfo . Ellas limitan su exposici n ante las personas t xicas y negativas , explica Corley , para luego recordar que la importancia que le dan al hecho de sustituir a sus amigos y conocidos negativos por otros individuos positivos deriva del hecho de que la positividad es una de las caracter sticas que comparten las personas ricas , y siempre quieren relacionarse con quienes les emulen . Resulta llamativo , pero Thomas C. Corley no ha sido el nico ni el primero en estudiar el comportamiento de las personas ricas . Hace ochenta a os , el periodista Napole n Hill lleg a conclusiones similares tras haber investigado a m s de 500 millonarios . Los hombres adaptan su naturaleza a los h bitos y el poder del pensamiento de aquellos con quienes se asocian y no ven ninguna esperanza de xito en las personas que repelen a los dem s por culpa de su personalidad negativa , escrib a Hill nada menos que en 1937 en el libro â€˜ Think and Grow Rich . Conclusi n : que el esp ritu negativo nos descarrilar de nuestro sendero hacia el xito , al tiempo que atraer como a moscas a personas con igual carga t xica . Entonces , si quieres triunfar , saca una sonrisa , da un paso adelante , piensa de manera optimista y huye de las malas compa as .",

Late Tuesday night , too late for Colbert and The Late Show to get on it that day , CNN actually released one of those recordings so everyone could hear it . So on Wednesday , The Late Show began with a cold open that claims that Cohen did n t just secretly record Trump . He also secretly videotaped him .

Also Read : Kimmel Jokes That Release of Cohen Tape Is No Big Deal for Trump : ' For Him , It 's Just Wednesday ' But there are a few amusing bits that are immediately entertaining . The first is probably that the enormous microphone Cohen used to record the conversation is hidden in a small plant that he placed on Trump s desk , and in the video , we see that when the record becomes muffled it s because Cohen is touching the plant . Other details include the picture of Vladimir Putin on Trump s desk , multiple different copies of The Art of the Deal scattered around , along with Ivanka s book , The Trump Card . When Cohen compliments Trump on his new poll which the video miscaptions as pole to set up this joke we see the feet of a woman stepping up onto Trump s desk to start pole dancing . And perhaps the best moment comes when Trump asks for a Coke and is given a two-liter bottle with a straw sticking out of it , which he immediately goes to town on .

		"paragraph": "REUTERS/Noah Berger Tesla spiked as much as 6 % in early trading Monday after the electric-car maker reached its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week , just hours after its self-imposed deadline . The production milestone was hit at around 5 a.m. local time on July 1 , Reuters reported . Tesla confirmed the milestone in a regulatory filing Monday morning , which said it built 5,031 Model 3 's in the last week of the quarter , though skeptics warn the burst of production in a giant tent next to Tesla 's Fremont , California assembly plant may not be sustainable . \" 7000 cars , 7 days , \" Elon Musk , chief executive of the electric automaker said on Twitter to mark the Model 3 milestone as well as its other goal of 7,000 Model S and X cars . \" < 3 Tesla Team < 3 . \" He also announced the news to employees in an email , which Bloomberg published in its entirety . Workers had been alternating two , 12-hour shifts per day to ramp up production , according to recent reports . The company even built a massive tent structure outside its main assembly line , building a supplementary line completely from salvaged parts , Musk said . The Model 3 heralded as Tesla 's first \" mass market \" car has plagued the company since its launch . Tesla has struggled to meet its self-imposed goal of producing 5,000 of the vehicles per week since the beginning of the year . Amid a cash crunch , Tesla has focused on Model 3 options with sticker prices in the $ 65,000 + range , as opposed to the more affordable $ 35,000 base model , which it has yet to begin building . Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino warned in June that Tesla would likely miss its Model 3 targets , echoing the skepticism of many of his peers . Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg have an average price target of $ 314 for the stock , which is currently trading near $ 359 a share . Musk has acknowledged the production struggles on Twitter , where he discussed sleeping at the factory while also blasting out photos of the tented assembly line , as well as armies of seats and other car supplies destined for Tesla cars . Monday 's stock surge also makes true on Musk 's recent warning of the \" short burn of the century , \" another show of his disdain for short sellers , or those investors betting against Tesla 's stock price . \" We did it !! \" Musk said in his email to Tesla employees Sunday evening , obtained by Bloomberg . \" What an incredible job by an amazing team . Could n t be more proud to work with you . It is an honor . \" He continued : \" The level of dedication and creativity was mind-blowing . We either found a way or , by will and inventiveness , created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible . Intense in tents .

		"paragraph": "Super Bowl LI and those much-anticipated Super Bowl ads are just a few days away , but people still talk about the ad that many have called the greatest Super Bowl commercial of all time : Apple s 1984 commercial , the one that launched the Macintosh . The 60-second ad directed by Ridley Scott , a future Oscar nominee , who had just directed Blade Runner aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 , just two days before Apple would change the world with the introduction of the Mac . The 1984 ad itself was just as groundbreaking , not only leading Apple to more than $ 150 million in sales in the first 100 days of the Mac s debut , but also introducing the idea of the Super Bowl ad as entertainment , a part of the Super Bowl broadcast that is , for some viewers , the reason for tuning in on game day . Related : Super Bowl LI Opening Night : Live updates from Yahoo Sports And , if Apple s board of directors had had its way , the 1984 spot would n t have aired during the Super Bowl at all . Advertising man Fred Goldberg , the Apple account manager for Chiat/Day when the agency created the 1984 ad , details the history of the commercial in his new book The Insanity of Advertising : Memoirs of a Mad Man ( Council Oak Books ) , and he filled Yahoo TV in on some surprising facts about the 1984 ad : We showed them a rough draft , and they thought we were insane , says Goldberg , who was on the set for the three-day ad shoot in England . Everybody thought it was going to look badly on Apple . Because Apple was really getting hurt by IBM at that point . In 1983 , [ IBM ] was really beating the heck out of Apple â€¦ 98 percent of the companies in the world were using PCs . The [ Apple ] board of directors did n t think this was a very smart-looking thing to put on the air . Here we are , slapping the [ industry ] leader in the face . It was a commercial like none other . It made a statement , a very aggressive statement , against IBM . Everybody likened the image of that guy who s doing the talking we called him Big Brother to IBM , which was known as Big Blue . That image was really going at the heart of IBM , and [ the board ] was concerned about what that would look like . They were concerned what the stockholders would say , and what their customers would say , so they got scared . Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a big fan of the ad he excitedly introduced it at the 1983 Apple keynote address in San Francisco and had even offered to pay for it to air himself . The Apple board was so opposed to it , however , that they ordered Chiat/Day to sell off all 90 seconds worth of ad time the company had bought for the Super Bowl . The agency s co-founder , Jay Chiat , had other ideas . It was Jay Chiat s direction that everybody move very slowly , Goldberg says with a laugh , so we did . The agency managed to unload 30 seconds of Apple s ad time , but 60 seconds remained , and 1984 aired . And look what happened , says Goldberg . The ad s official TV debut was on Dec. 31 , 1983 , on a station in Twin Falls , Idaho , planned so the commercial would be eligible for industry awards competitions that year ( it won the Grand Prix at the 31st annual International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes in 1984 ) . But 1984 also ran in 13 markets around the country in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl , including a station in Boca Raton , Fla. for one very specific reason . It was originally scheduled to air in 12 spot markets , but Steve Jobs wanted to add Boca Raton , where IBM s PC center was located , Goldberg says . Hardly anybody [ was ] going to buy a computer down in Boca Raton . If you ve ever been down there , you ll know there was n t a lot of industry there , but he wanted to poke â€˜ Big Blue in the eye , so he added Boca Raton to the schedule . And though the ad ran for two weeks before the Super Bowl , [ i ] t was n t even a blip on the register until then , Goldberg says of the pre-Interwebs age . Post-Super Bowl , the commercial has only aired as part of programs about great TV commercials . Unlike other computer companies at the time , Apple s big Super Bowl ad was free of celebrity spokespeople . M * A * S * H star Alan Alda starred in a 1984 Super Bowl ad for Atari , and The Incredible Hulk star Bill Bixby pitched Tandy computers , but the Orwellian-themed 1984 spot featured unknown British actress Anya Major as the woman who tosses the sledgehammer at the screen where Big Brother ( British actor and voice artist David Graham , who had provided Dalek voices in early Doctor Who eps ) is speaking to an assembly of followers ( 300 extras hired off the street , who , according to Goldberg s book , were paid less than $ 25 a day for the shoot ) hanging on to his every word . Post - 1984 , Major did star in another popular video : She was the titular Nikita in Elton John s 1985 music video for his hit song . Not even close , Goldberg details in his book . The production actually totaled around $ 650,000 , and that budget included not just the 1984 spot that aired during the Super Bowl , but a 30-second version of the ad , as well as 30 - and 60-second versions of ads for another Apple product : the ( unsuccessful ) Lisa computer . Goldberg writes in The Insanity of Advertising that he had hired a market research firm to test the Apple ad and present him with a report that would predict its effectiveness . The average score for a 30-second spot was 29 . The research firm s score for the 1984 ad : 5 . Goldberg says he s sure that Steve Jobs never saw the report which he still has a copy of and included a photo of in his book but feels certain it would have made the tech legend even more committed to airing the commercial . I am almost certain that he never knew that the â€˜ 1984 commercial was judged an unpersuasive research failure of the highest magnitude , Goldberg writes in his book . I am also sure that it would have simply reinforced his personal belief in judging things from the gut and intuition , and not relying on â€˜ scientific tools like creative research . He knew from the very first moment he saw the idea that it was â€˜ insanely great . ' Super Bowl LI airs Sunday , Feb. 5 , at 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox .",

		"paragraph": "In 2016 , when the NFL s stance of refusing to place a franchise in Las Vegas began to wobble , former Oakland Raiders CEO Amy Trask began repeatedly framing the change in one word . Antiquated . For anyone who listened , Trask kept the message on a singular point : The NFL s playbook on protecting the game against gambling was outdated . In one significant way , the league s marriage to the gambling world had already been established without consent coupled through the Internet , inside smart phones and in the grasp of technological ingenuity that had brushed aside the NFL s reticence . Trask was absolutely correct . And two years later with the Las Vegas Raiders on the horizon and a Supreme Court decision that allows states to legalize sports betting the NFL is now neck-deep in sports gaming . And over the long run , that s going to be a titanic financial windfall for the NFL , despite fading protests that have roots in the league s antiquated thinking on the gambling issue . To put a fine point on Monday s developments for the NFL : the league is n t invading Las Vegas anymore . It turns out that Las Vegas is invading the league , from New York to Los Angeles to Des Moines , Iowa . Wherever an NFL game is being played , chances are you ll be able to put some type of wager on it very soon . Now it s up to the league to not only embrace that reality , but also monetize it . This is a good thing for the NFL . If there is anything this league knows how to do , it s cash in on the product . Even when it takes time to get used to the idea which the NFL is , regardless of what some news release says about lobbying for sports gaming legislation . Does the NFL want a strict framework of rules for sports gambling ? Maybe . Does it want regulatory mechanisms in place to keep unseemly characters from crawling under the foundations of its game ? Probably . But more than anything , does the NFL want to be sure it gets a piece of all the legal gambling action on its game , regardless of whether a state houses an NFL franchise ? An educated guess is that in the long-term , the answer will be absolutely . And the best way to get a piece of all the action ( even in Twin Falls , Idaho ) , is to start lobbying for some type of nebulous regulation from Day 1 . That s precisely what the NFL did Monday . Make no mistake , the NFL is n t being caught flat-footed here . Its owners already had a gambling-specific discussion and presentation at the Orlando meetings in March , largely focused on the potential of Monday s landmark Supreme Court decision . But the NFL s homework started long before that meeting . Indeed , the NFL s power brokers have been thinking for quite some time about the changing attitudes toward gambling and what they could mean for the billions on the bottom line . You could see it in the fairly breezy 2017 relocation approval of the Raiders to Las Vegas . An approval which had the votes of the Los Angeles Rams , Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jacksonville Jaguars three ownership groups that also have significant stakes in English Premier League franchises , which all fall under an umbrella of legalized gambling overseas . And lest anyone forget , the starburst of daily fantasy sports gambling over the past five years included the rise of DraftKings , which has two eyebrow-raising investors in Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft . All of which confirms what we already know about the NFL . Its thinking may be antiquated in many respects but it s also remarkably fluid when it comes to massive sums of new money . And with the league targeting $ 25 billion in annual revenues by 2027 , it is aggressively on the lookout for new ways to monetize the product . Monday s decision will offer plenty . Not just through a traditional cut of gambling profits , which is sure to be sought by the NFL . There will be other streams of cash , too . Whether it s through higher television ratings from coast to coast , new waves of advertising partners , or more complex and lucrative deals with media partners , the equation laid out is fairly simple . A wider national gambling platform means more eyeballs . More eyeballs means more customers . And more customers means the same thing it has always meant : A bloated cash register . How the NFL gets to that windfall remains to be seen . As owners indicated at the Orlando meetings , a Supreme Court decision kicking the door open on gambling would be just the first step in a long process of monetization . One in which there will be a massive string of planning , meetings and regulatory debates . Not to mention the ramping up of a security infrastructure that protects NFL franchises from an explosion of gambling , which is sure to draw in some questionable characters along the way . But this also would n t be the first time the NFL learned to embrace something it once considered the underbelly of its product . Fans only need to look as far as ticket scalping to understand how quickly the league can turn what it deemed a negative into a net-positive for its bank account . It was n t that long ago when the NFL griped incessantly about the secondary ticket market that made massive sums of cash off tickets the league had already sold to fans . But after years of wondering how to tackle the sellers who had created a massive underground economy off of the league s product , the NFL decided to join in and double-dip on its own ticket sales . Rather than chase around scalpers through local law enforcement or in the court system which was expensive and ineffective the NFL simply cut deals with large ticket brokers . And then it went out and formed an even deeper partnership with TicketMaster , launching an NFL ticket exchange that gave the league a second cut of profits and teams an opportunity to track the product it was selling to season-ticket holders . Just like that , the NFL took a negative and spun it into a positive . It gained more power over its product , gained more money on the bottom line , and coopted a new business frontier by embracing the technological ingenuity of someone else . Few business empires are more capable of pulling off such a financial bonanza with its product . Even fewer are capable of repeating it . The NFL can do both . And starting with Monday s push into the deep end of the gambling pool , it will .

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK As a young NBA coach , the fastest path to losing a locker room comes this way : Behave like a player . To fly to California and visit a girlfriend in the middle of the New York Knicks ' training camp engaging Matt Barnes in a Tom-and-Jerry tussle-and-chase cost Derek Fisher dearly . Fisher lost the moral high ground inside Madison Square Garden , lost a measure of gravitas as a leader of men . The embarrassment of his unfilmed \" Real Housewives \" episode did n't cost Fisher his job as Knicks coach , but it did start him on a slippery slope toward his firing on Monday . That October weekend odyssey was Fisher 's choice , and the blame for it all including the failure to return to New York in time to conduct a Knicks practice belongs to him . Still , sometimes culture influences behavior inside organizations . Think Fisher never saw Phil Jackson bolting town to see Jeanie Buss ? As one member of the Knicks organization wondered , \" Where would [ Fisher ] get the idea that it was OK to fly to California on an off day to see your girlfriend ? \" For better and worse , yes , Jackson 's lifestyle and sensibilities set the tone with the Knicks . Fisher lost players with his discombobulated rotations and revolving roles . Inside the locker room , the Knicks had come to struggle with understanding how they fit into this team , league sources said . Above Fisher , Jackson worried about how that impacted the development of the roster . What 's more , there were times Jackson felt Fisher had strayed too far from the triangle offense , still a sacred part of the Knicks president 's program . For Fisher , there was no advantage to longtime Jackson disciples Kurt Rambis and Jim Cleamons getting jammed onto his coaching staff 18 months ago . The Knicks have the resources to hire elite coaches , and Jackson pursues the familiar , the comfortable . His coaching tree is too small , too unaccomplished to cling so tightly to it . Rambis and Brian Shaw have no business as candidates to coach the Knicks but there 's a world of Jackson sycophants that delivers the idea credibility . Everyone can forget about Tom Thibodeau 's candidacy , because Jackson would never cede control never mind to someone who sees basketball so diametrically different than him . Anyway , Jackson has never hid his disdain for the Jeff Van Gundy coaching tree in truth , most everyone else 's coaching trees . In a lot of ways , Jackson exists in a parallel universe to the NBA . He hires coaches out of his world , personnel scouts out of his world . The idea of Rambis , Shaw or Cleamons as long-term Fisher replacements is embarrassing . Jackson is n't using the Knicks ' vast resources to lure the best player personnel staffs and coaches to the Knicks , just likeminded people , just his guys . Nevertheless , he probably never promised owner James Dolan a different vision . Every executive has the right to execute his vision , but this is far too narrow , too exclusive . There are two kinds of employees with the Knicks : Jackson 's guys and Dolan 's guys . Jackson tried to move out some of Dolan 's people , but never got his way . Within both groups , there are some real , smart , talented people . Jackson has made solid personnel decisions in free agency , and wisely kept the No. 4 pick in the 2015 draft to select Kristaps Porzingis . Still , the coach , the system , will be important in free-agent recruiting , because most believe Jackson is a short-timer on the job . The Knicks have a real chance to sell Oklahoma City 's Russell Westbrook in 2017 New York and Porzingis have his attention , yes and Jackson ought to start constructing an elite coaching staff to begin that process with Westbrook and with free agents beyond him . Golden State assistant Luke Walton is closest to a legitimately coveted candidate with ties to Jackson and the triangle and he 's still largely unproven , too . Walton intrigues Jackson , but truth be told : Why would Walton come East without an assurance Jackson is committed to the long run in New York ? There 's still a strong belief Jackson will eventually find his way to his fianc e Jeanie Buss and the Los Angeles Lakers . Walton will be competing with Thibodeau for the Lakers job in the spring , and who knows : Jackson and Walton could be reunited there . Walton is a West Coast guy , the way his boss , Steve Kerr , is too . Kerr turned down Jackson and New York , because he had far more attractive choices . Porzingis makes the Knicks job intriguing in the long run , but make no mistake : One way or another , Jackson will be gone before the next Knicks coach has cycled through New York . To think the next Knicks president/GM Steve Mills or Isiah Thomas will stay true to the triangle is absurd , and so hiring one more triangle coach is almost guaranteeing him Fisher 's fate . Nine losses in 10 games including five straight was the end of the line for Derek Fisher on Monday . He lost credibility in the preseason and lost his grip on these Knicks in the past month . Fisher tried to push past that triangle offense , and Phil Jackson resisted those wishes . Jackson does n't want to come downstairs and do the job himself , but yet he still demands it done his way , on his terms . His coaching tree is full of failures trying to be him , trying to run his vision . Another is on the way to New York , and history has shown : There 's only one Phil Jackson , and unless he wants to coach the Knicks himself , he ought to let someone else do it his way .

The newlyweds will step out next week for a London performance of the hit musical , Hamilton , Kensington Palace announced on Monday . The event on August 29 will raise funds for one of Harry s longtime charities , Sentebale , which he set up alongside friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho . The couple , who took in a performance of the hit show during a private date night around Valentine s Day earlier this year , will be the guests of honor , alongside the show creator , Lin-Manuel Miranda .

Miranda , who has been in Wales recently , and the royal couple will also address the audience , Kensington Palace said . Tickets for the special performance range from $ 25 to $ 130 plus a charity donation . Sentebale is set to receive thousands of dollars to help fund its work for children and young people affected by HIV and AIDS in Lesotho and Botswana . Harry , 33 , and Meghan , 37 , made another high profile visit on behalf of the charity when they attended its polo cup match on a scorching summer day at the Royal Berkshire Polo Club last month . Harry s friend , polo player Nacho Figueras , who is an ambassador for Sentebale , told PEOPLE that Harry and Meghan were very , very happy . He added , She s lovely , she s wonderful . I m very happy for her , for Harry . The palace also announced that Meghan will join Harry at one of the key nights for another important cause : An awards night for WellChild . On September 4 , the charity , which works on behalf of seriously ill children and their families and caretakers , will celebrate the inspiring qualities of the young people and the dedication of those who go the extra mile to keep children healthy and happy , including the outstanding health , social care and education professionals . It will be an important evening for the couple as Harry publicly introduces Meghan to the charity on an occasion in which the prince is regularly seen comforting and giving his trademark hugs to some of the families and young people he meets . Like Sentebale , WellChild was one of the charities invited to send beneficiaries and dignitaries to the couple s May 19 wedding . Two nights later , on Sept. 6 , Meghan and Harry will attend 100 Days to Peace , a gala music evening marking the centenary of the end of World War I at Central Hall Westminster .

		"paragraph": "HOUSTON ( AP ) Houston s Clint Capela certainly is n t a household name , and does n t get nearly the attention other centers like Ruby Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns receive . But after he outshined those stars the first two rounds of the playoffs , the league is taking notice that Capela is one of the pivotal pieces to Houston s success as the team prepares for its showdown with Golden State in the Western Conference finals starting Monday . What he does is as good or better than anybody in the league without a doubt , coach Mike D Antoni said . Capela leads the NBA this postseason in blocks ( 2.8 a game ) and offensive rebounds ( 4.1 per contest ) . He s fourth with 12.2 rebounds a game overall and his 14.4 point average in the playoffs ranks third on the Rockets behind James Harden and Chris Paul . This came after a regular season where the fourth-year player posted career highs in virtually every statistical category . He averaged 13.9 points , 10.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in helping the Rockets to 65 wins and their first No. 1 seed in franchise history . What he does has been unbelievable , D Antoni said . And he ll be overlooked . They ll say he s a role player and it s not true . The Rockets insist that their high-powered , three-point centered offense would n t work the way it does without the 6-foot-10 Capela . His work as the finisher in Houston s pick and roll has proven valuable in the playoffs so far . His prowess in that area was on full display in Houston s Game 5 win that eliminated the Timberwolves in the first round . He shot 12 of 14 and finished with a game-high 26 points to help Houston to the 122-104 victory . Harden has often said this season that Capela is the player that makes everything else work for the Rockets , and said Friday that he s undoubtedly developed into one of the league s best centers . For sure , Harden said . He s done it for the last few years and he s definitely showing it now in the postseason . You ve got guys that just are comfortable with being in the NBA and you ve got guys that actually want to have a legacy and Clint s one of those guys . To that end Capela is constantly trying to learn and add new wrinkles to his game . He was always picking the brain of eight-time All-Star Dwight Howard when he backed him up in his first two NBA seasons and he s developed a close relationship with former Rockets star and Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon . Capela can often be seen working with and talking to Olajuwon at practice and Capela said Olajuwon has been impressed with the 23-year-old s progress . He just said I was great and playing with confidence and energy and to keep it up , Capela said . While the Capela sees Olajuwon as one of his top mentors , he also appreciates a particular skill of another former Rocket . There are times after Capela blocks a shot that he wags one of his long fingers in the air as Dikembe Mutombo often did during his more than decade-long career in the NBA . Just having fun and also sending a message that it s still my paint , Capela said with a laugh . Capela has had at least one block in each of Houston s playoff games this season and tied a career-best with six in Game 4 against the Jazz . Most impressive about that performance is that five of those blocks came in the last three minutes to help Houston secure the road victory . He said that shot-blocking barrage was the product of his getting upset after receiving a rare technical earlier in the fourth quarter when he got tangled up with Donovan Mitchell and the two did a little jawing at each other . Whenever I got a little into it with this guy from the other team , it fired me up a little bit and I just decided that they would n t score anymore , not in my paint , he said . So this is what happened . Capela is happy with his improvement this season , but far from satisfied with his play . He knows he ll have to keep getting better if the Rockets hope to reach the NBA finals . I m just trying to be more consistent every game , he said . I think during the playoffs I ve gotten better with my intensity and by doing that I thought that our team got better too . ",

Look at all of you , the Taxi Driver star told the audience . You are at this amazing concert because you took your responsibility as global citizens seriously . You took the time to join with other citizens to make a difference . Now we re asking you to take your responsibility as US citizens seriously by voting . Voting is how we tell our government what we want and what we do n t want , he added . Put it another way , voting is how we hire and how we fire our leaders . The 75-year-old added : Guess what ? They are not our bosses . We are their bosses . If we think they are doing a good job we can keep in their jobs . If there is someone we like better we can hire them . And if we do n t like the job they re doing we can fire them . You have got the power now please use it . De Niro , who won two Oscars for playing Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II and Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull , did not refer to any leaders by name in the speech . But the actor has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump , using his speech at June 's Tony Awards to lash out at the president . \" I m gon na say one thing : f *** Trump , \" he told the audience at New York 's Radio City Music Hall , before he introduced Bruce Springsteen . Raising both fists in the air as he received a raucous standing ovation from the audience , he added : \" It s no longer ' down with Trump . ' It s ' f *** Trump . \" Mr Trump then responded by attacking the actor in a Twitter tirade , calling him \" a very low IQ individual \" and suggesting he had \" received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies . \" He added : \" I watched him last night and truly believe he may be ' punch-drunk ' . I guess he does n t realise the economy is the best it s ever been with employment being at an all time high , and many companies pouring back into our country . Wake up Punchy ! \" Mr Trump did not refer to a specific film , although De Niro has appeared in various violent roles , including boxing biopic Raging Bull about the life of former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta . De Niro followed up his speech on a visit to Toronto where he apologised for the president rather than to him . \" I just want to make a note of apology for the idiotic behaviour of my president , \" he said . \" It 's a disgrace . And I apologise to [ Canadian Prime Minister ] Justin Trudeau and the other people at the G7 . It 's disgusting . \"",

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK ( AP ) Netflix has lured Shonda Rhimes , the well-regarded creator of TV series \" Scandal \" and \" Grey 's Anatomy , \" from ABC , its latest big get as media companies old and new fight for viewers ' attention . The streaming service 's announcement late Sunday comes just days after ABC owner Disney laid out plans to pull programming from Netflix . Netflix said Rhimes ' Shondaland production company is moving to Netflix for a multi-year deal . New ideas and projects from Rhimes and her producing partner , Betsy Beers , will be available on the streaming service . \" Starting today , we are thrilled to begin creating new Shondaland stories with Netflix , \" Rhimes wrote . But her existing , well-known shows \" Grey 's Anatomy , \" '' Scandal \" and \" How to Get Away With Murder \" will remain on the network . Upcoming Shondaland projects already in the works , like the drama \" For the People \" and a \" Grey 's \" spinoff , will also still stay with ABC . Rhimes has had exclusive deals with ABC Studios for nearly 15 years . ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said \" fans can rest assured \" that the network 's Thursday night lineup of Rhimes-produced shows \" remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever . \" Rhimes ' shows have been among ABC 's top-rated series . \" I 'm proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked about shows on television , \" Dungey said in an emailed statement . Financial terms of the Netflix deal were n't disclosed , nor were details on how long Rhimes and her company will produce series for Netflix . Disney , meanwhile , said last week that it was creating a new streaming service of its own for kids and launching an online-subscription version of ESPN . Disney said it will pull Disney and Pixar movies and shows from Netflix for the new service aimed at kids , expected to launch in 2019 . ABC shows wo n't be included , but Disney has hinted that it could shift more content to this new model . Disney is also launching an ESPN streaming service , without pro football and basketball , early next year . It has said it might also sell the full ESPN channel directly to viewers online if viewership disintegrates currently , a cable or satellite subscription is required . Disney is setting itself up for the future as ratings for traditional TV have suffered . Competition for viewers is increasing and attention is shifting online , where video can be watched on a viewer 's schedule an option Netflix has taught viewers to love . ABC ended the traditional TV season in May at the No. 3 slot among the big broadcasters and down 9 percent in the ratings , according to Nielsen . It 's rebooting \" Roseanne \" and \" American Idol \" in the 2017-18 season and bringing back popular comedies \" black-ish \" and \" Modern Family . \" Netflix continues to invest in more original programming to win those eyeballs . It 's not competing with just cable anymore . Traditional TV companies have launched or are planning a slew of streaming services , and tech companies like Amazon and Google 's YouTube have as well . In the past few weeks , Netflix has signed up David Letterman and bought a comic book publisher to turn its characters into movies and shows . Rhimes wrote in a statement that she was grateful to ABC for giving her career a start , but she was looking forward to expanding her audience and \" creative identity \" with Netflix . Rhimes ' shows are known for their diverse casts , cliffhangers and dramatic twists set in American institutions like universities , hospitals and the White House . \" Shonda Rhimes paved the way for a lot of the transformation that we are seeing in television today , \" said UCLA professor Darnell Hunt , who studies diversity in the entertainment industry . Hunt said television executives are beginning to understand that getting more minorities in top roles is n't just marketable , but \" demanded by increasingly diverse audiences . \" He said digital platforms like Netflix have lagged traditional TV in diversity and Rhimes could help change that . Rhimes wrote that she and Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had developed a plan for the next phase of her career . She said Netflix offered her and her team \" limitless possibilities . \" \" I 've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she 's a true Netflixer at heart she loves TV and films , she cares passionately about her work , and she delivers for her audience , \" Sarandos wrote . Rhimes , 47 , has been nominated for three Emmy Awards , all for her work on \" Grey 's Anatomy . \" The long-running series begins its 14th season next month . \" Scandal \" will return for its seventh and final season in October .",

Like many others , Meyers took issue with Trump s initial response Saturday afternoon , which was to condemn hatred , bigotry , and violence on many sides . On many sides , Meyers said . If that choice of words made you sick to your stomach , good news , you re a normal and decent person . The jury is still out on the president as he initially refused to condemn the white supremacist movement in this country . On Monday , two days after the violence that claimed the life of Heather Heyer and injured dozens of others , Trump made another statement , this time denouncing the KKK , neo-Nazis , white supremacists , and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans . For Meyers , it was too little too late . He did read a statement at the White House today ( Monday ) that finally struck the right tone , but I m sorry . â€˜ Pencils down on this subject was Saturday evening . He only gets very partial credit , Meyers said . Meyers also pointed out the unintended consequences of Trump s refusal to denounce white supremacists when some , like former KKK grand wizard David Duke , openly supported him during the campaign , saying some now see Trump as leading that movement . Meyers ended his statement with a final message for Trump . If he does not preside over our society , then he is not a president , Meyers said .

		"paragraph": "Norm Macdonald is getting skewered for his victim-shaming interview with the Hollywood Reporter . While promoting his upcoming Netflix talk show , Norm Macdonald Has a Show , the Canadian standup comedian managed to offend a lot of people while defending friends Roseanne Barr and Louis C.K. He clarified his comments in an apologetic post on Tuesday night . When the interview was published earlier in the day , Macdonald upset some by appearing to sympathize more with his friends than their victims . I m happy the #MeToo movement has slowed down a little bit , he said while discussing the lunacy of both liberals and conservatives . It used to be , â€˜ One hundred women ca n t be lying . And then it became , â€˜ One woman ca n t lie . And that became , â€˜ I believe all women . And then you re like , â€˜ What ? Like , that Chris Hardwick guy I really thought got the blunt end of the stick there . Hardwick was accused of sexual and emotional abuse by a former girlfriend , but the allegations did n t end his career . AMC suspended and then reinstated the television personality as the host of their aftershows for both The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead . The model used to be : Admit wrongdoing , show complete contrition , and then we give you a second chance . Now it s : admit wrongdoing and you re finished , explained Macdonald . And so the only way to survive is to deny , deny , deny . That s not healthy that there is no forgiveness . The 58-year-old comedian added , I do think that at some point it will end with a completely innocent person of prominence sticking a gun in his head and ending it . That s my guess . I know a couple of people this has happened to . When asked who specifically he was referencing , Macdonald replied , Well , Louis [ C.K. ] and Roseanne [ Barr ] are the two people I know . Louis C.K. saw his career suspended for nine months after admitting to sexual misconduct , but after a brief time out , he returned to the stage and was met with ( mostly ) open arms . As for Barr who gave Macdonald his first break in Hollywood writing for the original Roseanne she was promptly fired by ABC after sending a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett . Roseanne was so broken up [ after her show s reboot was cancelled ] that I got Louis to call her , even though Roseanne was very hard on Louis before that , Macdonald told THR . But she was just so broken and just crying constantly . There are very few people that have gone through what they have , losing everything in a day . Of course , people will go , â€˜ What about the victims ? But you know what ? The victims did n t have to go through that . Macdonald said Barr and Louis C.K. told him they had a good conversation and were just giving any advice you could give to each other . He added , There would be no way for me to even understand that advice , because who has ever gone through such a thing ? All their work in their entire life being wiped out in a single day , a moment . For the record , Macdonald , who also wrote for the Roseanne reboot , does n t think his friend is a racist . I always knew her as a very left-wing person , he maintained . On the original show , she had [ a network sitcom s ] first gay couple . She would always want more minorities on the show , on the writing staff . When she did this [ reboot , ] it was all her idea to get all these different orientations and religions and so forth represented . So that s how I always knew her . As for Barr s history of questionable tweets , he said , I had looked on her Twitter feed once in a while . I really could n t understand her because I am not that worldly in politics . Her feed was so arcane about these Middle East politics . What I do know is that she is a single-issue motivated person . And that issue is Israel . That s all she cares about politically . She is left wing in everything else . But that is why she did not like the Obama administration , because they snubbed Netanyahu . I believe that is the only reason that she voted Trump . She is certainly not a racist . That s just crazy . Twitter did not appreciate Macdonald s comments , as you can tell from a sampling below . Kathy Griffin called it f ****** ridiculous .

		"paragraph": "Second only to SPF , retinol is widely considered the gold standard of skin care by most dermatologists . The all-star ingredient has been proved to fight acne , smooth wrinkles , and improve tone but with such potent powers comes a drawback . As a dermatologist , retinol is an ingredient I often recommend to my patients . However , the one downside to retinol is that my patients can be afraid to incorporate it into their skin care routine given that it often requires a tolerance buildup , explains Dendy Engelman , MD , a dermatologist at Manhattan Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in New York City . To see results from retinol , you need to use it consistently , but some patients ca n t get past the initial dryness , redness , and peeling skin that is sometimes associated with adding retinol to their routine . So what does Engelman prescribe her patients who want to reap those same benefits minus the irritation ? Bakuchiol . Pronounced back-uh-heel , the natural , over-the-counter extract is the buzzy new ingredient that has proved to be just as powerful as retinol , without the downside . Bakuchiol is an antioxidant found in the seeds of the babchi plant , Engelman tells Yahoo Lifestyle . A 2014 study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science outlined how bakuchiol functions similarly to retinol with its anti-aging effects , upregulating and stimulating collagen just like its chemical counterpart . The 12-week study also showed that using bakuchiol twice a day resulted in a significant improvement in lines and wrinkles , pigmentation , elasticity , firmness and overall reduction in photo-damage . Shop the trend : Ole Henriksen Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum , $ 58 , sephora.com Bakuchiol is a proven ingredient , and is also free of the common side effects associated with retinol , including irritation , peeling , redness , and drying , adds Engelman . Since bakuchiol works as an anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant , those with dry , sensitive skin can reap the benefits of using the gentle ingredient and the upside does n t stop there . Unlike retinol , which can be too harsh on skin and only used at night , bakuchiol can be used morning and night , says Engelman . The antibacterial properties of bakuchiol also mean it s great for those with acne and have oily skin . When she prescribes retinol to her patients , Engelman says the rule of thumb is to avoid specific products such as exfoliators , toners , and benzoyl peroxide since they can further irritate skin . However , due to bakuchiol s natural composition it is safe to use with other products in your skin care regimen , she says . Also , unlike retinols that should be avoided while pregnant , bakuchiol is safe to use . Shop the trend : ISDIN Melatonik Serum , $ 150 , isdin.com While longtime retinol users may not see a need to incorporate bakuchiol into their daily skin care routine , Engelman says they can use both simultaneously . If my patients can tolerate a retinol and want to try bakuchiol , I recommend they incorporate both into their skin care routine . There are no known side effects to using a retinol and bakuchiol in the same skin care regimen . Given the clinical results and the mere fact that it does n t irritate skin the way retinol does , Engelman says she wo n t be surprised to see the bakuchiol pop up in more skin care products . I think as more research is conducted on the benefits of bakuchiol , you may see a shift in what dermatologists are recommending to their patients . Just this year , we ve seen a few new bakuchiol-boasting products pop up . One of my favorite products is ISDIN Melatonik , says Engelman . It s a nighttime serum formulated with three key ingredients including melatonin , bakuchiol , and vitamin C. Together , these ingredients work to help the skin repair , restore , and correct itself at night , while preparing it for the next day .

		"paragraph": "WACO , Texas The first guy I saw after parking my car at McLane Stadium on Friday night was wearing a gold T-shirt that read , Bears against the nation . So , welcome to the Baylor bunker ? Maybe , maybe not . If that is the prevailing mindset here that poor Baylor has been unfairly pilloried for allowing a violent culture of sexual predators to proliferate on its football team it was hidden Friday night . The one guy in the one shirt was the only overt example I saw of anyone playing that card prior to the No. 23-ranked Bears season-opening , 55-7 demolition of FCS Northwestern State . There were no visible signs in the stands voicing support or sympathy for fired coach Art Briles or any of the other administrators swept out in reaction to a damning outside counsel report last spring . There were no signs saying anything , other than one young girl with an I heart Baylor message . This was an environment scrubbed clean of any larger program context . There were tailgating boats in a man-made basin right outside The House That Art Built , and fans on blankets on the hillside , and several thousand Baylor students who got to run across the field pregame in matching yellow shirts . That tradition that came with a twist , because the person who used to lead that charge was fired president Kenneth Starr . This time , the team captains led the charge . Things change , quarterback Seth Russell said . And some things do n t change . Baylor scored a ton of points . There were a lot of female fans in attendance . Season tickets were sold out , and the crowd was announced at 44,849 slightly more than last year s home opener , although there were a lot of empty seats in a stadium with a listed capacity of 45,000 . If you did n t know better , you d think this was high-end college football business as usual . We needed it , said Baylor cornerback Ryan Reid . We needed to let it go . Let everything go and just play football . It was a change of subject , to be sure , one the players and fans were desperate to embrace . But make no mistake , the residual stain of scandal is still there . This is n t a complete makeover , not yet . Just look at the sideline . The guy calling the plays in the Bears familiar , up-tempo offense is Kendal Briles Art s son . He had his dad s initials written on his hand last night , something interim head coach Jim Grobe said was fine with him . At least one Baylor staffer wore a pullover that had #CAB Coach Art Briles on the chest . The guy coaching the offensive line is Jeff Lebby Art s son-in-law . The guy in charge of the defense the side of the ball where so many of Baylor s bad actors played is Phil Bennett , who held the same position under Briles . Offense did n t change , defense did n t change , said running back Shock Linwood . KB s still here , he s calling the plays the same . Baylor bit the bullet administratively and with the head coach because it had to . But in a very difficult spot , it kept Briles staff intact to salvage this season . That s not a complete culture change that s a half-measure , a concession that shows winning football remains very important here . The figurehead brought in to lend an element of class and dignity to the program is Jim Grobe . The 64-year-old former Wake Forest coach is being paid a reported $ 1.25 million this season to basically handle news conferences and special teams , while the younger Briles and Bennett take care of the offense and defense . It s a pretty sweet seven-figure gig for a guy who had been out of coaching for two years , but I d like to know if they turned on his headset . Grobe spent most of his first Baylor game walking the sidelines with hands on hips , staying clear of the coordinators and their unit huddles with players . After good kickoffs , he bumped fists or slapped hands with the kicker . He occasionally directed the punt returner on how deep to line up for the many Northwestern State punts . He did seem to make a couple of fourth-down decisions , opting to kick field goals twice in situations where Art Briles might have gone for it . Grobe is a very good coach who is taking over a program that bears no stylistic resemblance to what he built at Wake Forest . In one night with Baylor , his team scored more points than in any of his previous 226 games as a college head coach . I love being back on the sideline , Grobe said . I love coaching . â€¦ I thought there was a lot of doubt , kids were in shock , coaches , too . But I think after a while the kids realized I m here to help . He s had a few new off-field revelations to deal with through the summer , including a wide receiver who was suspended three games for inhumanely whipping his dog . Given the track record , all the Baylor coaches are likely to sleep with their cell phones on and nearby this weekend . The key for us going forward , these guys need to make really good decisions off the field , Grobe said . That s the expectation across the athletic department . Mack Rhoades officially took over as athletic director Aug. 15 , jumping out of the dumpster fire at Missouri for the tire fire at Baylor . Rhoades said he s met individually with every coach to express his vision going forward . The message was , â€˜ It s going to take some time and it s going to take doing the right thing , Rhoades said . The combination of those two things , we ll get it back to where it needs to be . â€¦ Baylor athletics has been really , really good , but I believe the best days for Baylor are ahead . We ll learn from this , we will . Hard lesson learned , obviously , and we re still learning from it . After opening night , it seems one lesson learned is for Baylor not to publicly embrace a persecuted mindset . There are far bigger victims here than the fired football coach and a team that has undergone a wave of bad publicity . That mentality was largely kept under wraps . But does it exist behind closed doors ? Almost certainly . Quarterback Russell was asked what it was like to lead the student charge across the field , and his answer was interesting . It s great to have unity with Baylor Nation and with the students , Russell said . It s not just us against the world . It s all Baylor against the world . That sounded like a pregame T-shirt I saw , and it required a follow-up question about whether that is the team s outlook this year . It s more that you have a lot of negatives surrounding us , Russell said , changing course . We re going to try to make those negatives into positives . That might be harder to do than putting 55 points on the scoreboard . Winning games and winning over detractors are two very different things . More college football coverage from Yahoo Sports :",

		"paragraph": "Just over a week after being at the front of a long line of celebrities criticizing Kanye West for his latest round of pro-Trump antics , Lana Del Rey is now dealing with the consequences : a much uglier and more trivial feud with the rapper and professional provocateur Azealia Banks . Banks , still not that far removed from that whole Grimes and Elon Musk madness , moved onto her next Internet spat on Tuesday night , apparently having received word of Del Rey 's comments to West , whom she 'd apparently just \" reconnected \" with . Banks then embarked on a tweet storm on her new unverified account @shopcheapyxo her official account has once again been suspended for similar feuding which saw the 27-year-old rapper quickly move from criticizing Del Rey for commenting on the situation as a white woman to attacking her physical appearance , tweeting a photo of the singer and making suggestions as to how she could improve it , including a crude substitute for Botox involving semen , and of course her new soap products , which she then proceeded to thank Del Rey for helping her promote . Naturally , it was n't long before Del Rey responded , telling Banks : \" u know the addy . Pull up anytime . Say it to my face . But if I were you - I would n t . \" She then moved the conversation out of her replies to her main feed , tweeting \" I wo n t not f --- you the f --- up . Period , \" which has since gotten well over 100,000 retweets and 300,000 likes . Lest there was any mistake , her next tweet made it crystal clear who she was addressing : \" Banks . u coulda been the greatest female rapper alive but u blew it . dont take it out on the only person who had ur back . \" She then added to Bank 's thread about her physical appearance , offering to put Banks in touch with her surgeon and \" a good psychiatrist . \" Banks declined Del Rey 's offer by suggesting that Del Rey 's surgeon was the one who lead her to be addicted to Oxycodone a topic she also raised in a separate rant on her Instagram Stories , describing Del Rey 's performances as consisting of moves like a \" cokehead Oxycodone turnaround \" while she does her \" little Lolita chola cosplay . \" In between further digging into Del Rey 's appearance , advising her that she had bigger problems to worry about than \" Kanye West and his hats , \" she also got much more specific about her real qualms with the 33-year-old singer : her politics . Specifically , she accused Del Rey of only weighing in on issues that involve an \" easy target \" like West , whom Banks clearly does n't think Del Rey should have anything to do with . \" You , a privileged white woman , have no f --- ing business opening your mouth to a black man from Chicago , telling him what he should and should n't f --- ing believe in , \" she said , adding ( among many , many other things ) that Del Rey was among the white women in Hollywood who \" will take any opportunity to make themselves seem more righteous in regards to black men who do n't bow down to their vapid ' social power . ' \" In an impressive display of multitasking , Banks was simultaneously also going off on Twitter , retweeting her fans ' reactions , which ranged from merely petty to seriously alleging racism ( ex . \" azealia would be ratchet if she called lana out to fight first , but bc lana does it , and she s the one with the pasty white skin , everyone stans her \" ) to standing by her claims that Del Rey was never there for her when she reached out for help , despite touting herself as someone who supports women . Banks also brought West back into the matter , posting a screenshot that appeared to show he 'd taken her side . Banks then asked her followers if she should \" be extra white woman and sue Lana for threatening \" her an idea she seemed to be seriously entertaining when , soon after , she retweeted a story about Del Rey 's tweets along with the comment \" She 's getting sued ! \" Del Rey , who has already gotten into a legal battle this year with Radiohead , told Banks to tell her lawyer that her words were \" a promise not a threat . \" Still , Banks did n't seem to be taking things too seriously . She 's apparently tuning into the American Music Awards and watching videos of the launch of Musk 's SpaceX rocket , which she later personally praised him for , retweeting a photo he posted of the launch with the comment \" Uggggh Daddyyyyy . \" ( Notably , she also posted a topless video of herself . ) Meanwhile , Del Rey has been laying low , though the same ca n't be said for her fans . Some even apparently took it upon themselves to edit the \" Years active \" section of Banks 's Wikipedia page , putting in the day of the feud as her career 's end date .

Even after producers decided not to use the alternate happy ending that was filmed ( I arrive at the airport and Avery s standing there with Cadence , the violins play , and I run into his arms , Panettiere remembers ) , she still did n t know Juliette would be in a wheelchair . Related : â€˜ Nashville Season 5 Premiere Recap : Back in Business How much will the experience of the crash and the road to recovery change Juliette now ? The direction she chooses to go in , I was shocked , Panettiere says . And I think the audience will be , too . It opens a door for her , and she discovers this part of herself that is completely undiscovered . â€¦ Something awakens inside of her that was never there before , that is so un-Juliette . But that being said , it s so important to keep Juliette s insanity present and in the show . I m like , â€˜ I ca n t be this character unless we have these moments that fluctuate , where she can be this insane person in one second and then this very humble , grounded inspirational person in the next . â€˜ We ll let you watch the video interview above to hear Esten discuss Deacon and Rayna s healthy sex life , which is befitting of newlyweds . He and Panettiere had fun debating who works harder to get ready for those kind of scenes . Their banter continued when we quizzed them on personal trivia to see which one of them knows the other better â€¦ What they can both agree on is that they re loving the new season of Nashville . It s not just that we ll be hearing more singing and maybe even longer portions of songs . ( Sometimes we would have to get in and get out . That s a little tricky because a song is like a story , Esten says . If I was to tell you a third of a story right now , you d be like , â€˜ Oh â€¦ that was interesting . You want to let it go to the end . ) It s that conversations between characters on the show can breathe now , too . Our scenes are actually longer , Panettiere says . They breathe . We have time to actually feel like we ve told the full story . You can really gauge where the characters are and what they re feeling . You see the character s wheels turning , and they re not saying anything at all . I m reading the script [ for the Season 5 premiere ] , and there s a scene where Rayna and I are just talking , Esten says . Then the next scene comes , and it s us in another room of the house and we re still just being together ! It s like , â€˜ Oh , wow , we get to go there . All these little intricacies , along with what Hayden was saying about the unspoken moments , just the looks that s the stuff that drew everybody to our show in the first place . I thought the way that Rayna started the whole season instead of flying home , she took the backroads where she rediscovers this old music was a very symbolic way of showing what [ new showrunners Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick ] are saying they re doing with the show . We are now not flying like we were we re taking that symbolic backroad , and rediscovering the old music . Related : Review : â€˜ Nashville Is Back , Slowed Down and Passionate Now all these co-stars need is some more screentime together . Panettiere has been a fan of Esten s since she admittedly stalked him during the audition process . I m doing my audition for the show , he says . I do a couple scenes and I sing a couple songs . I come out the door and there s nobody in that waiting room but Hayden basically with her ear to the door and going [ claps fast ] . I said , â€˜ Can you come to all my auditions and do that ? ' And then I did , Panettiere says , laughing . That was how we met , Esten says . I said , â€˜ All right , I ll see you on the set . Then I kind of laughed because I was just blowing smoke , I was nowhere near getting that role at that point . Then we saw each other at the test . Then she said , â€˜ See you on the set . Then we showed up and we were in Nashville . Nashville airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on CMT .",

A jury has told Beats luminaries Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine to pay Lamar $ 25.2 million in royalties for breaching a contract . Lamar contended that he played a key role at the company and deserved $ 130 million for working on a dozen headphones . Beats recognized Lamar 's early involvement , but insisted that he was only supposed to get money for the original Beats Studio ( which , of course , had already been paid ) . Lawyers for Beats did n't comment . Lamar 's lawyer was unsurprisingly \" happy \" with the result , even if it fell well short of the $ 130 million target . It 's not certain how much Dre and Iovine will have to pay . Something tells us they wo n't face too much hardship , though . Lamar filed his lawsuit mere months before Apple acquired Beats in May 2014 -- $ 25.2 million is practically a rounding error for the headphone brand in 2018 . This is big news for Lamar , of course , but for Beats it mainly closes a messy chapter in the company 's history .",

Saturday did n t provide nearly the suspense as Nunes continually battered Raquel Pennington at UFC 224 for her seventh straight win and third since taking the belt from Miesha Tate in 2016 . Nunes tripped Pennington up with a leg kick early in the first round and was the aggressor throughout the fight . She repeatedly followed leg kicks with head blows early on , backing Pennington up to the edge of the Octagon and leaving the outside of her left leg bright purple and red from the repeated strikes . After a pair of failed attempts while backed against the cage , Pennington scored a takedown of Nunes late in the second round to slow the steady onslaught from the champion . But Nunes was never in trouble and continued to attack a weary Pennington throughout . Nunes delivered several knees to Pennington s face in the fourth , leaving her faced bloodied . Pennington wanted to retire after the fourth round with an apparent broken nose , but returned to fight the fifth after her corner talked her into it . But Pennington did n t have anything left in the tank , and Nunes went in for the finish , pinning Pennington on her back around the 3:00 mark . Nunes attacked her face again , and blood poured from Pennington s nose onto the mat before the fight was called for Nunes via TKO at 2:36 in the fifth round . Nunes , a Brazil native , invited Pennington to join her for the post-fight interview in the cage and spoke of her respect for her opponent in front of Rio de Janiero s Jeunesse Arena . It was very hard for me this fight , Nunes said . It was the most hard of my career to fight this girl . Because we have the respect . When it comes to finish this bout , something I ve dreamed about for so long , I have to do it . But right now . We are friends . We re going to leave this cage . We re going to have a beer and celebrate our friendship . The two fighters then embraced .

		"paragraph": "CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela 's president Nicolas Maduro announced on Friday a single exchange rate and pegged it to his socialist government s petro cryptocurrency , effectively devaluating by 96 percent . Maduro said he would overhaul Venezuela 's disparate exchange rates and peg salaries , pensions , and prices to the petro , a cryptocurrency launched by the government earlier this year . He said one petro would equal $ 60 and have the equivalent of 360 million bolivars . That implies a new exchange rate of 6 million bolivars per dollar , broadly on par with widely used black market exchange rates , entailing a 96 percent devaluation compared with the current official DICOM rate of 248,832 bolivars per dollar . Since 2003 Venezuela has had strict currency controls , identified by economists as a major cause of its economic crisis , which has spawned hyperinflation and rendered the bolivar currency near worthless . \" They 've dollarized our prices . I am petrolizing salaries and petrolizing prices , \" Maduro said on state television on Friday night . \" We are going to convert the petro into the reference that pegs the entire economy 's movements . \" Precise details were not immediately available and the Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment . \" World champions in economic disasters ! \" opposition leader Henrique Capriles tweeted after Maduro 's announcement . \" No Venezuelan deserves to live this tragedy or that these incapable people destroy our nation ! \" The International Monetary Fund has predicted that inflation in Venezuela would hit 1 million percent this year . And Crypto currency experts have cast doubt on the petro as a functional financial instrument , citing a lack of clear details on how it operates and U.S. sanctions that make it off limits for most financial market operators . Maduro said the measures would tackle an \" economic war \" that he has said was being waged by Western powers to sabotage his administration .

It s a groundbreaking event for Hollywood : the first tentpole superhero movie with a predominantly black cast . And it s buoyed even further by stellar reviews . But , yes , the film s director , Ryan Coogler , and face of the franchise , Chadwick Boseman , will admit they felt the pressure of bringing a cultural touchstone like Panther to the big screen . It is a lot of pressure in terms of , people have already bought their tickets , they ve already shown they re excited about it , Boseman told Yahoo Entertainment at the film s Los Angeles press day ( watch above ) . I think once they see what the movie is , they re going to realize that this is a totally new experience . It is sort of a movement . Black Panther , co-written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole , follows T Challa ( Boseman ) back to his homeland of Wakanda after the events of 2016 s Captain America : Civil War . He assumes his role as the rightful heir to the African kingdom but soon finds himself in battles against an international terrorist ( Andy Serkis s Klaw ) who has pillaged some of the nation s most valuable ( and secretive ) resource , vibranium , and an American mercenary ( Michael B.

		"paragraph": "Novak Djokovic had some hard words for the Centre Court crowd after his four-set victory over British No 1 Kyle Edmund had featured some testy exchanges with the fans . You could sense the crowd s impatience during Djokovic s never-ending bouncing of the ball , and when chair umpire Jake Garner gave him a time violation in the middle of the third set , the stands erupted in a mixture of cheers and boos , followed by a slow hand clap . It was hardly the old-school stiff upper lip for which Wimbledon used to be known . How would Djokovic react ? By raising his game . And by actively baiting Edmund s supporters . After holding serve in the game that contained the time violation , he blew two kisses into the air . Then , when he finished off the third set to move 2-1 ahead , he held his hand to his ear and made a couple of come on , then hand gestures . This was a man relishing adversity . I thought the crowd 's reaction after that [ the time violation ] was quite unnecessary , said Djokovic . A couple guys pretending they were coughing and whistling while I was bouncing the ball more or less to the end of the match at that end where I received the time violation . Those are the things obviously that people do n't get to see or hear on the TV . I just think it 's not necessary . That 's what I did n't like . Asked about his provocative reaction , Djokovic replied If you were in my position , you would probably understand . My interaction with the crowd , I thought had good things and not that great things . I just reacted the way I thought it was fair , the way they reacted to me . The crowd was very fair when I played against Andy [ Murray ] . Obviously they support their player . But today there was just some people , especially behind that end where I got the time violation , they kept on going , they kept on going , provoking . That 's something that I can tolerate for a little bit , but I 'm going to show that I 'm present , as well , that they ca n't do whatever they feel like doing . If we rewind a little , Edmund had come out full of fire and thunder at the start of this eagerly awaited third-round match . His forehand looked like it could punch through concrete as he bullied Djokovic in a world-class first-set performance . Could Wimbledon live up to Samara s example ? As the shadows lengthened on Centre Court , Edmund looked like he might feed off the feats of the England football team , becoming the first Englishman to reach the second week of Wimbledon since Tim Henman in 2004 . But Djokovic is a hard nut to crack . Had Edmund consulted his mentor Andy Murray before the match , this would have been the main takeaway of their conversation . And the same cussedness that sent Murray tumbling out of eight major tournaments did for Edmund in the end . Djokovic spent much of the first 80 minutes whingeing to his box and holding out his arms in disbelief whenever one of Edmund s shots found the line . But in the middle of the second set he settled to his work . And what work it was . The one place on the court that Edmund did not want to be was stuck in his own backhand corner . At least , not unless he could perform Jim Courier s patented backside boogie and bring his open-stance forehand into play . The problem is that to hit that shot the backed-off forehand you need time to run around the ball . And Djokovic s scudding backhands were homing in venomously on their target . The double-handed backhand is the key to Djokovic s game , and it was when he began to gather pace and confidence on that shot that the match turned . Edmund found himself penned into the exact position he did n t want to be in , as if held down by guy-ropes . The statistics reveal what a clean performance this was from Djokovic . The scorers adjudged him to have struck 41 winners and only 15 errors . After reaching the Queen s final a fortnight ago , he is looking increasingly like the man who has won this title three times , and will start as an almost unbackable favourite against Karen Khachanov in the last 16 on Monday . As for Edmund , his decline means that for the first time since 2007 , there is no British singles player in the second week of Wimbledon . Still , when you consider that he came into this fortnight with only one victory from six matches on these grounds and that against a fellow Briton ranked No. 869 this was a significant step forward . On today 's form , he would have beaten the majority of fellow seeds he faced in the third round . Djokovic is vastly under-rated at No. 12 , which made this a deeply unfortunate draw . Once Djokovic s post-match interview had moved on from the baiting and whistling , he was asked whether he thought Edmund can win a grand slam . Of course , he replied Why not ? He improved his game in the last 12 months . We always knew forehand is a weapon , but backhand , he was making a lot of unforced errors from that end . He improved a lot since he started working with a new coach . He completed his game . He 's top 20 . He 's going towards top 10 . He 's definitely going to be a contender . ",

		"paragraph": "The police report from Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell s arrest has been released , and provides more details on Maxwell s actions the night he was arrested for aggravated assault with a weapon and disorderly conduct . The report , which totals 20 pages , includes the statements of eight officers who were on the scene . Personal information , such as Maxwell s address , have been redacted . You can read the full police report here . Here s a rundown of the relevant points , according to the officers : A Postmates delivery person called police saying a man pointed a gun at her while she was delivering food to his home . The man was later identified as Maxwell . According to the woman , Maxwell opened the door and pointed a gun at her face . She asked if he was Bruce , the name on the order . Maxwell acknowledged the gun at one point , telling her not to worry about it . He eventually took the gun out of her face and took the food . She made it to her car and called police . The woman said the whole interaction took about 60 seconds . Police arrived at the scene , found Maxwell and asked him to call 911 and listen to the person on the line regarding how to exit the house safely . He walked out of the house with his hand raised and cell phone to his ear . Officers asked Maxwell if he had any guns . He admitted to having two , but said he also had a concealed carry permit . Police returned later with a search warrant and found both firearms . Maxwell was compliant until asked to get on the ground . He was handcuffed by officers at this time . One officer readied his taser , while at least two others pointed their firearms at Maxwell during this time . Neither the taser nor firearms were used . As officers began asking Maxwell questions , they reported a strong odor of alcohol on his breath . One officer said Maxwell was often yelling , using excessive profanities and kept contradicting his version of events . At some point during the questioning , Maxwell reportedly grew upset and started making anti-police statements . The woman positively identified Maxwell as the person who put a gun in her face after he was taken into custody . Police confirmed that a Bruce M. placed an order at the restaurant where the Postmates driver picked up Maxwell s food . The 26-year-old Maxwell is the only Major League Baseball player to take a knee in protest during the national anthem . He played in 76 games with the Athletics in 2017 , hitting .237 / .329 / .333 . Maxwell began kneeling at the end of the season , and explained his reasoning behind the decision to Yahoo Sports Jeff Passan . Shortly after the end of the regular season , Maxwell was involved in an incident at an Alabama restaurant where he claimed a waiter refused to serve him due to his protests . The waiter has called Maxwell s version of events an absolute lie . Shortly after his arrest , the A s said they were disappointed and were still gathering information about the case .

		"paragraph": "Bill O Reilly recently launched a seemingly out-of-nowhere attack on Stephen Colbert . Colbert has seen his Late Show ratings tick upward lately , and as I ve noted elsewhere , it seems to coincide with his increase in pointed jokes about President Trump and his policies . Rather than view this as a fine example of capitalism perceiving a market , giving people what they want , and profiting by it O Reilly has chosen to ignore Colbert s American style of trade and instead lambastes him for being unpatriotic . ( Lambaste , by the way , would make a fine O Reilly Factor Word of the Day . ) Thus , last week , O Reilly led off a segment he announced as Profiteering from despising President Trump . He played a chunk of a Colbert monologue from last Wednesday , in which the Late Show host made a comparison with Trump : You know who also said troubling things in a quiet voice ? Hannibal Lecter . Colbert then played a clip of Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs , dubbing in a fake Trump voice murmuring threats against immigrants . O Reilly was joined by Fox News contributor and former newsman Bernie Goldberg for one of the Factor s Weekdays With Bernie segments . ( Get it ? Because there was a movie called Weekend at Bernie s ! ) Goldberg agreed that bashing Donald Trump can be good for business , while also noting that bashing Barack Obama was also good for business not in late night , where there are no conservatives , but in conservative media : for talk radio [ and ] for websites that were created during his era . OK , said O Reilly , but during the Obama presidency , you never saw a comedian use a movie clip from a heinous villain [ sic ] about Barack Obama . If a comedian had done that , O Reilly said , people would have been fired , there would have been demonstrations , charges of racism all of that would have happened . Hold on , hold on : Charges of racism ? If Colbert or someone else had compared Obama to Hannibal Lecter or any other heinous villain , Colbert would have been accused of racism ? What s racist about comparing someone to a fictional character ? This is something O Reilly and other Fox News prime-timers have done frequently : They see Obama primarily through the prism of race . Besides , Colbert has compared Obama to a menacing figure the evil troll in the fairy tale Three Billy Goats Gruff . Should there be any rules for what the anchor or the comedian or the host is allowed to present when you re talking about a president ? asked O Reilly , seeming to suggest Colbert ought to be muzzled . O Reilly asked Goldberg another hypothetical : If you were producing the Colbert show , and he s No. 3 in the ratings as he was for the first two or three years he was on â€¦ ( I ll stop here to say Colbert s Late Show started in September 2015 he s been doing it for a year and a half ) â€¦ then you discover the magic egg , said O Reilly , rubbing his thumb and fingertips together in the common sign for making money , and [ your ratings ] go boom , would you do it ? It s sad that O Reilly has such a mean , grubby view of the world , in which people do everything for money for the Factor , all is cynicism and revenge , it seems . Maybe the next title in his bestselling Killing series should be Killing Colbert it has a nice alliteration . The O Reilly Factor airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News . The Late Show With Stephen Colbert airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on CBS .",

		"paragraph": "Since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke last fall , it s deservedly been #TimesUp for a lot of men in Hollywood , but at least one has come through these tumultuous months with his reputation still intact . We re talking , of course , about Oscar , the little gold man that the industry s biggest event the annual Academy Awards ceremony is all about . And second-time host Jimmy Kimmel made sure to give the dude his due during his opening monologue . Oscar is 90 years old , Kimmel remarked during his monologue , before reeling off the reasons why he s still the most beloved and respected guy in Hollywood . He keeps his hands where you can see them , never says a rude word . And most importantly , no penis at all ! He is literally a statue of limitations . That s the kind of men we need more of in this town . For what it s worth , Kimmel s monologue , which alternated neatly between serious sentiments and silly one-liners , establishes him as the kind of Oscars host the industry needs more of in this time of seismic change . It also allowed him to exorcise the demons left over from the wrong envelope fiasco that closed out last year s ceremony , an incident that was acknowledged right off the top . This year , when you hear your name called , do n t get up right away , Kimmel joked , before letting us all in on a little secret . I ve not told this story in public : Last year , about a week before the show , the producers asked me if I wanted to do some comedy with the accountants . I was like , â€˜ I do n t want to do comedy with the accountants . Then the accountants went ahead and did the comedy on their own ! Sorry , PricewaterhouseCoopers Kimmel definitely did n t need any help in the comedy department . Watch the entire monologue above and check out our half-dozen highlights from his opening act below : 1 . Much as we would have loved to have seen Celebrity Street Fights With Mario Lopez , the black-and-white introduction to Kimmel s monologue was a technical K.O. , successfully marrying the patter of 1920s newsreels with 2010s jokes . Opining on Armie Hammer , the absurdly handsome star of Call Me by Your Name , for example , the narrator revealed that the actor was born when a witch put a curse on a Ken doll . As for Salma Hayek Pinault , being seated next to The Shape of Water â€˜ s Fish Man inspired the perfect pitch of a hybrid sequel : Fishy Shades of Grey . 2 . To illustrate how much the #TimesUp movement has changed Hollywood in only a few short months , Kimmel invited all of us to think back to the kinds of movies that were being made and marketed to that demographic in the year 2000 . Here s how clueless Hollywood is about women : We made a movie called What Women Want and it starred Mel Gibson . That s kinda all you need to know . 3 . While Black Panther was n t up for any Oscars this year , at least the cast of the Marvel blockbuster lit up the red carpet , riding high on their film s muscular $ 500 million and counting box-office gross . And Kimmel knew he could n t avoid the panther in the room . Our plan is to shine a light on a group of inspiring and outstanding films , he said of the night s Best Picture nominees , before adding each one of which got crushed by Black Panther this weekend . 4 . Back in the 1980s and 90s , Jack Nicholson was the Oscar regular the host loved to call out from the stage . These days , perennial nominee Meryl Streep has assumed that role , if not Nicholson s sunglasses . And Kimmel paid tribute to the grande dame of American cinema , hinting at her history as a not-so-secret badass . Her film career started in 1977 . The longest she went without a nomination is from 1992 to 1995 , and that s only because those were the years where she was in prison . 5 . Kimmel did n t hesitate to poke fun at the president . Pointing out the stunning Lupita Nyong o , Kimmel noted , She was born in Mexico and raised in Kenya . Let the tweetstorm from the president s toilet begin ! Kimmel then observed that Get Out mastermind Jordan Peele is only the first person in 90 years to be nominated for directing , writing and best picture for his debut film . What a debut it was ! None other than President Trump called Get Out the best first three-quarters of a movie this year . 6 . While we love long , heartfelt acceptance speeches , Kimmel came up with an inspired way of coaxing victors to keep their thank-yous short and sweet : a Jet Ski presented by another grande dame of cinema , Helen Mirren . But he did come up with one unique wrinkle : In the unlikely event of a tie , the Jet Ski will go to Christopher Plummer . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : ",

		"paragraph": "On Thursday s Cuomo Prime Time on CNN , host Chris Cuomo welcomed actress and activist , Alyssa Milano . She was on to discuss , what else , the Brett Kavanaugh investigation . But then the topic turned to Bill Clinton and his multiple allegations , which Kavanaugh supporters use in their arguments . When Cuomo asked Milano if Kavanaugh should get the same benefit of the doubt that Clinton got back in the 90s , Milano s answer was somewhat surprising to the host . No , Milano said of Kavanaugh . And I do n t think Bill Clinton should have gotten that benefit of the doubt in hindsight . Clinton has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by four women and has adamantly denied all four accusations . Three of those accusations came in the 90s . As a nation we were in a different time , I think that women were continually being silenced . And I think we gave him the benefit of the doubt and we probably should have investigated the allegations against him as well , Milano said . And even though Milano is a supporter of both Hillary and Bill Clinton , it s not a right or left issue for her . This is not about partisan politics to me , this is about humanity , Milano said . Even though this process is so uncomfortable for everyone , we really have to look at it , look at where we want to be , who we want to be as a nation â€¦ I think it s vital that we get past this and get to the results , which is something that we re all looking for , which is a just world with equality for women .

		"paragraph": " What was Nike thinking ? President Donald Trump tweeted the morning after his Billings , Montana rally . Answer of course is Same thing you are , sir , gloming on to a hot-button issue that has put the company in the headlines heading into NFL season . Just like Trump began using Colin Kaepernick to his advantage for months to whip his base back up after several political missteps . One year ago this month , at a rally , Trump urged NFL team owners to get that son of a bitch off the field when any player took a knee during the national anthem . Kaepernick was the first to do so , launching an effective protest of recent police maltreatment of African Americans . Trump s Nike reference is , of course , all about the company signing Kaepernick to its new campaign , including a TV ad it will use during this NFL season . Trump had refrained from trashing Nike , or Kaepernick , during his Billings bash , except for one fleeting reference at the one-hour mark when he promised attendees , We re standing up for your values , we re standing up for Montana , and we re standing for our national anthem and our flag . Moving on to Bob Woodward s blockbuster book about the Trump White House , POTUS this morning tweeted , The Woodward book is a scam . I do n t talk the way I am quoted , said the guy who insists he knows the best words , but kept botching anonymous at previous night s rally . Trump called the unnamed author of the damning op-ed about him in the New York Times Anomonous , and then , trying to course-correct , botched the word a second time with equal verve . These quotes were made up . The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle , said the president who previously told Woodward he was very fair in a phone conversation the Washington Post associate editor , recorded with Trump s knowledge . I wish the people could see the real facts , tweeted the president who rebuffed Woodward s repeated efforts to get him to sit down with him while working on Fear : Trump in the White House , and then insisted in that phone call to Woodward that none of his people had told him Woodward wanted to speak with him a playing-dumb-when-convenient routine Trump has been using on since back in his Apprentice starring days .

		"paragraph": "This past week the Pittsburgh Penguins added free agent Derek Grant on a one-year contract . Not a major signing , but one that still seems to be a little curious given the current construction of the roster . The 28-year-old Grant , you see , is a center . After bouncing around the NHL and recording just seven points ( all assists ) in 86 career games , mostly as a fourth-line/depth player , he finally received an increased role with the Anaheim Ducks this past season due to to their rash of center injuries and made the most of it . He scored 12 goals ( and added 12 more assists ) in 66 games and earned himself a one-way contract with the Penguins . What makes the signing so curious from a Penguins perspective is it comes just a few weeks after they brought back soon-to-be 42-year-old center Matt Cullen . That came after they re-signed restricted free agent center Riley Sheahan to a one-year , $ 2.1 million contract . Which came just a couple of months after they give up a bounty of assets to acquire Derick Brassard from the Ottawa Senators prior to the NHL trade deadline to give them another big-time third-line center to play behind their two superstars , Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin . That is â€¦ a lot of centers . Six , to be exact , all with NHL contracts , all expected to be on the NHL roster . Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said he wanted to make his team deeper after its second-round exit in the Stanley Cup Playoffs , and the additions of Cullen and Grant definitely help accomplish that . It also comes after the Penguins entered last season without much depth at the position following the free agent departures of Nick Bonino and Cullen . They opened the 2017-18 season with the likes of Carter Rowney and Greg McKegg playing NHL roles , a situation that was less than ideal . It is the exact opposite now . So what can they possibly do with all of these guys ? Option 1 : Somebody moves to the wing . Aside from the fact that Cullen or Grant will probably be healthy scratches from time to time , this is probably the most logical outcome as one of those two could also probably flip to the wing on the fourth line . The other candidate to move is Brassard who could move to the left side to play in a top-six role . This , of course , runs counter to the reason the Penguins acquired Brassard in the first place which was to help give them a trio of centers that no other team could match up with . Brassard not only has his best value at center , it also forces one of Sheahan or Cullen up into a third-line spot , both of whom would be a downgrade from what Brassard would likely do . Brassard s initial debut with the Penguins following the trade had its ups and downs and probably did n t work exactly as planned , but it was also only a 26-game sampling . Sometimes it takes time for a player to adjust to a new team , system , etc . The other issue with moving one of their centers to the wing ? They already have a lot of wingers . Phil Kessel , Jake Guentzel , and Patric Hornqvist are the top ones . Then there is Bryan Rust , Carl Hagelin , free agent addition Jimmy Hayes ( potential AHL player ) , and a crop of youngsters that includes Daniel Sprong , Dominik Simon , and Zach Aston-Reese . Moving one or two of the centers to the wings is going to take one of the latter group out of the equation , either relegating them to the press box or back to the American Hockey League . Sprong , the team s top prospect , is expected to be on the roster but he has n t fully seemed to gain the trust of the coaching staff to this point in his career and , quite honestly , his situation has reached the believe it when you see it point when it comes to his playing time and spot on the roster . Option 2 : Somebody gets traded . Crosby and Malkin are obviously on the untouchable list , while Cullen and Grant were just signed so they are not going anywhere , either at least not yet . That leaves Brassard or Sheahan , with Brassard probably being the most likely player to be used as trade bait because of the value he might still bring back and the fact he has the largest contract and the Penguins are firmly pressed against the league s salary cap . The optics of that would certainly be bad because it would look like they are admitting that acquiring him in the first place was a bad idea ( it was n t ) , and they probably would n t get back the value they gave up to get him . His value to them as a third-line center is more than it is as a second-line winger or as trade bait . Option 3 : Do n t worry about it , somebody is going to get hurt and depth is good . That pretty much sums it up , does n t it ? Evgeni Malkin has played more than 70 games in a season just two times in the past nine years . Cullen is going to be 42 years old . Grant is a bit of a mystery because he really has n t produced at an NHL level outside of this past season when his shooting percentage was 18 percent . The glut of centers will probably take care of itself . One thing you have to say about Jim Rutherford is that he recognizes his mistakes and is not afraid to correct them , with Mike Johnston and the way he undid all of his offseason moves a year ago being the two most notable examples . After opening last season with only two NHL quality centers on the roster ( something that definitely hurt the team ) he made sure this summer that is not going to happen again .

If you do n't want to know what happens in \" Captain America : The Winter Soldier , \" do not keep reading . Rest assured , though , even after reading what happened , you 're still going to want to see how it happened . Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo put together a tight , action thriller with sequences that stand with the best of anything Marvel has put out to date . It 's completely different in tone from the first \" Captain America , \" so it might be worth a look if that film did n't do it for you . Watch the trailer : Steve Rogers ( Chris Evans ) is still working for S.H.I.E.L.D. , but he 's become disillusioned with the way things are done in our time . S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to eliminate threats before they happen , which Steve does n't think is fair innocent until proven guilty , after all , is the bedrock of the American justice system . It turns out that S.H.I.E.L.D. has taken it one step further and developed a program similar to what is depicted in the movie \" Minority Report , \" only instead of clairvoyant psychics , a computer algorithm mines data to determine who is a possible future danger . They send up three Helicarriers equipped with all sorts of nasty weapons capable of taking out individuals from suborbital space , intent on creating order by removing 20 million threats . [ Related : What 's on Captain America 's To-Do List Across the Globe ? ] H.Y.D.R.A. , you see , has been infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. from its very earliest days , and the algorithm designed by a computerized Arnim Zola ( Toby Jones ) is the final step in their plan to bring a bloody order to the world . To stop H.Y.D.R.A. , Captain America and Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) have to completely destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. Wait , what ? Do n't they have a show called \" Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \" on TV right now ? What are they going to do now ? Call it \" Agents of H.Y.D.R.A. \" ? \" Just Some Agents Hanging Out on a Cool Plane ? \" That is absolutely a question that will have to be answered and soon because , as of last Friday , the show 's namesake is no more . Of course , this could take any number of \" Agents of the Organization Formerly Known as S.H.I.E.L.D. \" episodes to handle it 's a big agency , after all . And there are plenty of questions that will have to be answered . Watch the opening moments of this week 's \" S.H.I.E.L.D. \" : Such as , whose side is Agent May ( Ming-Na Wen ) on ? It 's most likely that she was spying on behalf of Fury , and the secrecy was necessary to keep information about Agent Coulson ( Clark Gregg ) away from H.Y.D.R.A . The Clairvoyant could n't \" see \" Coulson because it 's a computer program that uses data to predict the future all that classification of information that seemed like an obstacle turns out to have been protecting him . Watch a \" S.H.I.E.L.D. \" sneak peek : Who will they answer to now ? Fury is heading off to Europe ( possibly to look into that Quicksilver/Scarlet Witch situation that Baron Strucker is putting together ) will they join him ? Doubtful . Agent Hill ( Cobie Smulders ) joins up with Stark Industries after the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D. Maybe Coulson and company will be making their new home in Stark Tower ? There are a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. and S.H.I.E.L.D.-adjacent characters who probably wo n't make an appearance in the show . Agent Sitwell ( Maximiliano Hern ndez ) , who was seen last episode and , like Coulson , has appeared in multiple Marvel properties , is H.Y.D.R.A. , though the front end of a speeding truck makes a return unlikely . Of course , they said the same thing about a magical spear going through Coulson 's chest . [ Related : The Redford-Newman Reunion and 10 Other ' Captain America ' Easter Eggs ] Brock Rumlow ( Frank Grillo ) is one of the main H.Y.D.R.A. baddies who will likely become Captain America villain Crossbones . Sharon Carter ( Emily VanCamp ) , niece of Peggy Carter ( who helped found S.H.I.E.L.D. ) is also S.H.I.E.L.D. , but her romantic entanglements with Rogers in the comics probably means she wo n't be on TV any time soon . And finally , there 's actor Danny Pudi . It 's a long shot , but he appeared as his \" Community \" character Abed Nadir on the show \" Cougar Town , \" and we 're hoping that Com . Tech # 1 is actually Abed off on another interdimensional excursion . There are a lot of ways the show can go at this point . Where would you like to see it go ? Is there anything from the movie we missed that might give joy/grief to our plucky little band of superspies ? Next week 's \" Providence \" will introduce Adrian Pasdar as Major Talbot ( a frequent foe of the Hulk from the comics ) and comedian Patton Oswalt as Agent Koenig . \" Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \" airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on ABC .",

		"paragraph": "Senators who could cast the deciding votes on the fate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh gave little indication of where their heads were on the matter on Tuesday , hours after President Donald Trump announced his nomination . Kavanaugh , a conservative federal judge who previously served in the administration of George W. Bush , has been tapped to replace Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy , a longtime swing vote for whom Kavanaugh once clerked . His confirmation now rests in the hands of a narrowly split Senate , where defections from Trump s own party could sink his chances . But those lawmakers seen as possible candidates for defection namely Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine , moderate Republicans both were coy when asked on Tuesday for their thoughts on Kavanaugh . I find it interesting that that s the question when this name has just been down now for , what : ten hours , twelve hours ? Murkowski said , after a reporter asked her if any GOP members could afford to vote against the nominee . The tough job for all of us is to go to work . We ve got some due diligence that we ve got to do . That s Republicans and Democrats alike . If you re going to say â€˜ I m going to support him today or â€˜ I m not going to support him today , then you re not doing the job we re here to do . Murkowski and Collins have been the focus of a concentrated campaign against Kavanaugh by liberal groups and affiliated Democrats . The effort has flooded their respective home zones with anti-Kavanaugh advertisements intended to foment public pressure on the two lawmakers to vote against the nominee . The messaging initially centered on the future of abortion rights in the U.S. under a court with Kavanaugh on it . The way we re looking at it is this : If we do a good enough job , we ll make it obvious enough that Collins or Murkowski will be the deciding vote on whether Roe v. Wade is overturned , one Democratic aide told TIME last week , referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case on abortion . Collins was equivocal when asked about Kavanaugh in the Capitol on Tuesday morning . I obviously want the opportunity to sit down with him one-on-one and to get a better sense of his judicial philosophy , she told reporters . I do not apply an ideological test to their personal views . That s why I voted for Justice [ Elena ] Kagan and Justice [ Sonia ] Sotomayor , even though I do n t share the same philosophy with them . I found them qualified to sit on the court . I will go through the same process . The reaction of her constituents in Maine to Kavanaugh s nomination has been very mixed , she said . The anxiety over defections speaks to the narrowness of the Republican s majority in the Senate . Kavanaugh needs only a simple majority of 50 votes for confirmation there are 51 Republicans in the upper chamber , but Sen. John McCain of Arizona , who is being treated for brain cancer , is unlikely to vote . Just one flipped G.O.P. vote could sink Kavanaugh s chances . But senior Republicans have publicly dismissed this possibility . I m not worried about it at this point , Sen. John Thune of South Dakota , the Senate s third-ranking Republican , says . I think there s a process we have to go through , our members want to get acquainted with him , they want to meet him , they want to ask him questions . He deserves a fair process and we intend to give him that . The G.O.P. could be buffered by defections from the other side of the aisle . There is a small contingent of Democrats from states that Trump won in 2016 who face narrow paths to reelection this fall . Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota have all been floated as possible yes votes for Kavanaugh , but on Tuesday , they were just as mum as their moderate colleagues on the other side of the aisle . I m not making any rash decisions on this , Manchin said . Our people are looking into everything he s done in his professional life , and I intend to go back home and ask the people of West Virginia what they think . Manchin noted that he had great concern about what a conservative-majority court would mean for the Affordable Care Act s provisions benefiting those with pre-existing conditions . Heitkamp was more evasive . I have n t even met â€˜ em , she said , picking up her pace as she walked through the Capitol s basement to escape a growing throng of reporters . But other Democrats those with greater latitude to speak their minds were more outspoken . President Trump said he was going to put somebody on the court who was going to overturn Roe v. Wade and make abortion illegal and take away preexisting conditions and that s what he s got , Sen. Patty Murray of Washington told TIME grimly .",

		"paragraph": "By Steven Grattan IPIALES , Colombia ( Reuters ) - Tears welled up in Gabriel Malavolta 's eyes on Saturday as he realized his dream of a new life in Peru was over , at least for now . The 50-year-old mechanic fled Venezuela three days ago . He had hoped to make the overland crossing into Ecuador and then on to Lima , saying the deepening economic crisis in his homeland had left him without the basic means of survival . Traveling by bus with his fiance Yenny to the border town of Ipiales in southwest Colombia , Malavolta said he heard on the final leg of the trip that their plan had been ruined . As of 12 a.m. on Saturday , new regulations put in place by Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno prohibit Venezuelans from entering Ecuador without a valid passport . Previously , they could enter with no other document than their national ID cards . Malavolta has a passport , but his fiancee only has an ID card . They arrived at the Rumichaca border crossing outside Ipiales just six hours after the new regulation took effect . \" I do n't know what we 're going to do , but we ca n't go back . I 'm not sending my fiancee to go back and go hungry , \" he said as he sat in a Red Cross tent in Ipiales . \" You 've no idea what it 's like , whole families eat from the trash , \" he said of the desperate situation back home . More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia over the last 15 months , according to official estimates , but Ecuador has also received many refugees until now . About 300 Venezuelans were lined up at the border crossing early on Saturday . Like Malavolta 's fiancee , many indicated they had no passports to gain entry to Ecuador . Peru 's government announced immigration measures similar to Ecuador 's on Friday , with passport requirements for Venezuelans beginning on Aug. 25 . In Ipiales , Venezuelan mirgrants who said they had hitchhiked for days were huddled under blankets in tents when a team of Reuters arrived there late on Friday . Exhausted and hungry from their travels , some had scraped a few pesos together to buy food . \" I understand why Ecuador 's doing this , it 's for security , but we have to understand this is a particular phenomenon , given Venezuela is n't issuing IDs to people leaving the country , Jorge Enrique Qui nez , deputy representative of UNICEF Ecuador , told Reuters . Over the last two years , especially , many Venezuelans have struggled to obtain passports amid the OPEC nation 's political and economic chaos . Waiting in line for her passport to be stamped , 43-year-old Berta Caste ada , a Venezuelan math teacher , said she knew people who had been waiting for the prized documents for years . \" It takes forever , \" she said . Sitting on the floor outside a public toilet with her head in her hands , Adrianil Blanco sobbed . She said she had spent two weeks hitchhiking and walking to reach the Rumichaca crossing . Her tattered canvas shoes were a testament to hardship . Blanco had arrived at the border at 11 p.m. , with an hour to spare . She said she had no passport and her national ID card , a piece of laminated paper , was damaged so Ecuadorian border officials would not accept it . \" They do n't understand what it was like getting here . We got wet , we were sleeping on the streets , \" she said . Christian Kruger , head of Colombia 's migration authority , said on Friday Colombia has been bending the rules on migration issues to give a \" helping hand \" to Venezuelans . \" We 're taking about 3,000 people a day . If they start to accumulate we 'll see a large population around this area . \" He did not elaborate , but a buildup of refugees in and around Ipiales now seems unavoidable . This year alone , 423,000 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador through the Rumichaca border . But for Blanco , Malavolta and his fiance , the lack of passports means having to look elsewhere to make a new start .

		"paragraph": "Few hip hop feuds are as long-running , or exasperating , as the ongoing rivalry between 50 Cent and Ja Rule . The two rappers have been throwing jibes ( and the occasional punch ) at one another since 1999 . Their conflict has been simmering ever since , but flared up again in January this year . Ja Rule could n t help but lash out , and since then things have been more tense than ever , with their back-and-forths on social media serving as a by-product of a dispute that began in the streets . Most recently , 50 Cent decided to try and troll Ja Rule by purchasing 200 tickets to his forthcoming show in Las Vegas , for a total of around $ 3,000 and leave the seats empty . Ja Rule seemed to find the prank just as amusing as Fiddy did ( he still got paid , right ? ) , and responded by posting an image of his rival with makeup photoshopped on ( real mature , Ja ) . Here s a timeline of their beef so far In 1999 , Ja Rule was robbed for his chain at gunpoint in Southside Jamaica , Queens while he was filming a music video . According to 50 Cent , Ja Rule was incensed after seeing Fiddy at a club with the man who robbed him . A friend of mine robbed Ja Rule , 50 Cent recounted in his 2005 biography From Pieces to Weight . That s how the beef originally started . My man robbed him for a chain , and then this guy named Brown came and got the chain back for Ja . Later , Ja saw me in a club with the kid who robbed him . I went over to say , â€˜ What s up to Ja , and he acted like he had a problem with me . But I m not the one who robbed him . But Ja , who later confirmed the robbery took place , denied he ever saw Fiddy with the robber . He claims that the bad blood between them stemmed from Fiddy being snubbed by the Murder Inc. crew during a video shoot for his single Murda 4 Life . That same year , in October , 50 Cent released a single from his shelved debut album Power of the Dollar , which was a blatant diss directed at Ja and Murder Inc . It did n t name Ja Rule directly , but it did mock his label s signature Murda chant which gave fans enough of an idea about who the track was directed towards . 50 and Ja Rule got into a physical altercation at an Atlanta nightclub , where they were both booked to perform . Both their neck chains were broken during the fight a member of Fif s crew found Ja s pendant , and 50 claimed that a deal was made to return it in exchange for a Movado watch Ja denied that was the case . In a 2016 interview , Chris Gotti offered his own take , which was that the two were talking one-on-one when Ja hit 40 Cent with several questions at once . Fiddy lashed out , then Ja Rule allegedly pulled his shirt over his head and began swinging punches . Whichever side you believe , the incident proved to be a massive catalyst for the events that followed . In March 2000 , after receiving word that 50 was recording at the Hit Factory studios in New York , Ja and his crew decided to pay the rapper a visit . In the altercation that followed , Fiddy suffered a stab wound , and Ja Rule and Murder Inc. rapper Black Child were both arrested . Black Child took credit for the stabbing on record , claming it was an act of self-defence . In interviews after the attack , 50 consistently downplayed the incident . After signing a multi-million dollar deal with Shady/Aftermath records in 2002 , 50 Cent and G-Unit released the mixtape No Mercy , No Fear . One of the tracks , Wanksta , was credited by Fiddy as being inspired by Ja Rule . It became his first hit single , peaking at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 . After the brawl at the Hit Factory , Irv Gotti claimed Fiddy signed an order of protection against him and Ja , in an attempt to put his street credibility on the line . It was later confirmed that the order does exist , but was issued on 50 s behalf not his request as a formality by the NYPD . In June 2018 , Ja Rule shared the order again on social media and called 50 Cent a rat . 50 Cent was n t happy at being called a snitch . He fired back on the G-Unit mixtape The Future is Now via several tracks that dissed Murder Inc. I Smell Pussy was particularly brutal 50 called out Irv Gotti , Ja , Black Child and Cadillac Tah by name . 50 Cent finally released his debut album , the universally acclaimed Get Rich or Die Tryin , on 6 February 2003 . It claimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart and featured the track Back Down , which questioned the authenticity and street cred of Ja Rule and Murder Inc . In April 2013 , Ja Rule came back with one of the most disrespectful diss tracks in hip hop history . Loose Change fired shots at 50 Cent , G-Unit , Eminem , Eminem s daughter Hailie , Dr Dre , Busta Rhymes and Chris Lighty . Ja accused 50 of being a snitch , called Dr Dre a faggot , claimed all of the men mentioned enjoyed golden showers , called Eminem a cross-dresser and his wife a slut . Fans thought Loose Change was memorable , but 50 Cent , Eminem and Busta Rhymes were still able to come back with Hail Mary , which mocked Ja s obsession with Tupac Shakur . Ja Rule s fifth studio album was released in November 2003 , and marked a noticeable change in style from his previously more melodic work . It was critically panned and failed to match up to the success of his multi-platinum albums : Rule 3:35 , Pain is Love , and The Last Temptation . During an interview with Hot 97 in September 2013 , Ja Rule admitted he felt as though he and Murder Inc. had lost the war with 50 Cent . For the first time in years , the two rappers came face to face when they ended up on the same flight â€¦ on the same aisle . Ja Rule posted about the experience on Twitter but revealed , to the surprise of fans , there had been no issues between the two . 50 Cent headlined the Hot 97 Summer Jam festival in 2014 , and used his stage to mock Murder Inc ( again ) when he performed I Smell Pussy during his set . Ja Rule heard about the show and , rather than firing back , claimed Fiddy was obsessed with him . Ja Rule s memoir was released in July 2014 , and chronicled his rise to fame and all the tumultuous moments that followed . During one chapter , he claimed that it was 50s info that led to a federal investigation into Murder Inc an accusation that 50 Cent has denied . Despite Ja claiming the feud had flatlined by this point , 50 Cent could n t help mocking his rival by sharing a photo of Donald Trump appointing him as secretary of festivals . This was after Ja was blasted for his role in the Fyre Festival fiasco of April 2017 . Drake and Meek Mill spent summer 2015 in a battle of words , which some fans compared to the beef between 50 Cent and Ja Rule . However , neither Fiddy or Ja was impressed , and appeared to agree that the younger artists had nothing on their feud . In January 2018 , apparently responding to a 50 Cent interview where the rapper once again poked fun at him , Ja Rule sounded off on Twitter in a series of tweets that claimed 50 Cent owed him his life , and that he owned your soul â€¦ your [ sic ] my bitch ! The latest of many , many chapters in this ongoing and now quite exhausting saga is when 50 claimed to have purchased 200 tickets to Ja s forthcoming show in Las Vegas , with the intention that there would be a bunch of empty seats at the gig . In the posts on Instagram , he shared a Photoshopped image of himself sitting among the empty seats , along with an edited video that showed Ja Rule performing to an empty venue . Ja Rule seemed more amused by the stunt than anything , tweeting in response : I get under @50cent skin â€¦ I love it ! Later he posted a photo of 50 Cent , which was Photoshopped to look as though the rapper was wearing makeup and a wig .",

		"paragraph": "A letter about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that a top Senate Democrat referred to law enforcement details an accusation of sexual misconduct against the judge , The New Yorker reported Friday . Kavanaugh denies the allegation . A woman who did not want to be identified accuses the judge of trying to force himself on her during a party when they were both in his school in the early 1980s , according to the magazine . The New Yorker report says the woman claims Kavanaugh and a friend increased the volume of music to conceal an outcry from her , and that the judge covered her mouth before she got away . Kavanaugh said in a statement , conveyed by White House spokesman Raj Shah : \" I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation . I did not do this back in high school or at any time . \" The sexual misconduct allegation surfaces as Republicans move through a bitter process of confirming Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice . It is unclear now how it will affect Kavanaugh 's chances of serving on the highest U.S. court as senators decide whether to vote for him during a national reckoning over sexual misconduct . The woman first detailed the allegation over the summer in a letter to her representative , Anna Eshoo of California , but decided not to speak publicly about it , The New Yorker said . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat and ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee , eventually received the letter , as well . The New Yorker did not detail how it knew about the contents of the letter . Feinstein first declined to share details with the committee 's other Democrats , before agreeing to fill them in on Wednesday , according to The New Yorker . On Thursday , she said she referred the information to federal authorities . The FBI reportedly does not plan to open an investigation into the claim , and the bureau included the letter as an update to Kavanaugh 's background check given to the White House . A spokesperson for Feinstein did not immediately respond to CNBC 's request to comment . Read the full New Yorker story here .",

Figure skater Adam Rippon , one of the breakout stars of the Olympics for his statements and charisma both on and off the ice , was reportedly going to join NBC s Olympics team as a correspondent . Alas , it appears Rippon will be staying put in the Olympic Village , for very valid reasons . The figure skater joined NBC s Olympic Ice program and indicated he had something he wanted to clear up . Well , there you go . Rippon will not be an NBC correspondent so he can continue supporting his friends and teammates who are still competing in the Olympics . Joining NBC would have meant moving out of the Olympic Village and likely not being able to participate as an athlete in the Closing Ceremony . Rippon later detailed the circumstances behind his decision on Twitter , claiming he only found out about NBC s offer through Twitter . Rippon has not stopped making headlines since he arrived in PyeongChang . The 28-year-old trained endlessly to make the Olympic team after missing out on the Sochi Games , then performed a dazzling free skate to help Team USA earn bronze in the team competition . In singles competition , Rippon s short program topped any performance on the American team and he eventually finished 10th after the free skate . Off the ice , Rippon has been outspoken as one of two openly gay male athletes on Team USA , refusing to meet Vice President Mike Pence and speaking out against school shootings in the aftermath of the tragedy in Parkland , Florida . This has predictably brought him more than his fair share of haters . Rippon has stayed in the news since his competitions ended , giving crazy interviews and finally finding a stiff drink .

		"paragraph": "ABC is announcing Friday , Sep. 29 as the television premiere date for its new series , Marvel s Inhumans . That follows an exclusive two-week run on IMAX , where they re gambling that their first two episodes can equal or even exceed the visual flair of a $ 200 million Marvel film ( or at least an Ant-Man-sized $ 140 million ? ) . Marvel likes to keep its big and small screen worlds pretty separate and for good reason what looks like big budget on TV can look pretty paltry in a movie theater . But for Inhumans , the company is confident that it wo n t just look good big it ll look good on IMAX , the biggest screen of all . That s due , in part , to the fact that the first two episodes were shot on IMAX cameras . It s a boon for Marvel , whose TV shows are still sometimes knocked for lacking the visual effects of their cinematic brethren . It s also good for IMAX since the premiere happens at a time on the calendar where there are no summer blockbusters or big-action spectacle movies to draw audiences to their screens . The new poster features Maximus the Mad front and center , played by Game of Thrones â€˜ s Iwan Rheon . Maximus is a bit like Loki equal parts charm and evil though those who remember Ramsay Bolton may have some difficulty seeing through the latter to see the former . Anson Mount ( Hell on Wheels ) and Serinda Swan ( Ballers ) are the Inhuman king and queen , Black Bolt and Medusa . Both characters are frequent targets of Maximus as he attempts to usurp control of their people . They are encircled by the bolt-like insignia that has adorned Black Bolt s costume ever since his first appearance in 1965 and which shows up in a muted form in this current version .

		"paragraph": "Assigning a quarterback a personal record ignores that football is a team sport . Yet , some teams still believe in it . That s really the only way one can spin the Jacksonville Jaguars signing quarterback Blake Bortles to a contract extension . The Jaguars had a good season mostly due to their defense and running game , with Bortles making plays here and there winning the AFC South and almost winning the AFC championship game . They rewarded Bortles with a three-year , $ 54 million deal that can reach $ 66.5 million with incentives and has $ 26.5 million guaranteed , according to ESPN s Adam Schefter . Schefter said the deal ties the Jaguars to Bortles through 2020 . And you have to imagine , if the Jaguars defense or Leonard Fournette were n t as good as the Jaguars went 7-9 , Bortles play probably would have gotten him booted out of Jacksonville . [ Batter up : Join a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today ] That s not to say Bortles did n t have his moments , but he also had some poor games like when he failed to reach 100 yards passing in a playoff game against Buffalo ( the Jaguars defense held the Bills to a field goal in a 10-3 win , another reason why assigning a win to a quarterback is flawed ) . Bortles is still inconsistent . He had a middling 84.7 rating , which ranked 23rd among quarterbacks with 160 passes . Ryan Fitzpatrick ranked right ahead of him . Bortles threw for 21 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in a run-first offense . He did have some good games , including solid performances against New England and Pittsburgh in the playoffs and a hot three-game stretch late in the season , but he s also the same quarterback a lot of fans wanted benched for Chad Henne last August . He did n t suddenly turn into a top quarterback worth at least $ 18 million a year though , in this market that s not all that bad for a starting quarterback . But the Jaguars have a lot invested in him , he s still young and did show signs of improvement . And the Jaguars won 10 regular-season games last season . So instead of just letting Bortles play out his fifth year option , they were proactive and locked him up for a few more . It also obviously knocks the Jaguars out of the mix for any of the big-money free-agent quarterbacks . Bortles saved his job after the Jaguars picked him to start the season at quarterback over Henne . He played well enough , though he still had his shaky moments . But for better or worse , he s now the Jaguars quarterback for a few more years . Frank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "A new study being presented next week at the Radiological Society of North America ( RSNA ) shows that women prefer to receive an annual mammogram , as opposed to one every two years , as current guidelines recommend . In a statement , study author Ghizlane Bouzghar , chief radiology resident at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia , Pa. , says , Women understand that yearly mammograms have been shown to save lives and do not consider previously reported â€˜ harms to be as important as getting screened . Bouzghar and his fellow researchers surveyed 731 women receiving screening and diagnostic mammograms at Einstein Medical Center over a three-month period earlier this year , asking whether abnormal results and biopsies cause them emotional harm , whether screening every two years causes more or less anxiety than annual screening , and what their preference was in terms of screening frequency . Seventy-one percent of these women said they preferred getting screened every year . In 2009 , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPTF ) changed the recommendation regarding mammogram screenings for women from annually to once every two years because of risk of diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive cancers that would otherwise not have become a threat to women s health , as well as unnecessary biopsies and stress resulting from the potential from false-positive results from these screens . The USPTF reaffirmed these recommendations in 2016 . A systemic review of the harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography from the USPTF found that there is 10-year , cumulative false-positive rate of 61 percent with annual screening , but that false positive rate drops to 42 percent when screening occurs every two years . The American Cancer Society , however , presently recommends annual screening for average-risk women between the ages of 40 and 54 , and biennial screening with the option to continue annual screening for women ages 55 and older . This past June , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) issued a revision of its own breast cancer screening guidance for average-risk women , emphasizing that shared decision-making between patients and providers is most critical for determining a patient s need for screening mammography . Per ACOG s updated recommendations , women with an average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 . If they have not initiated screening in their 40s , then they should begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 . ACOG recommends that women and their ob-gyns engage in a dialogue that includes discussion of the woman s health history the benefits and harms of screening and the woman s concerns , priorities , values , and preferences about the potential benefits and harms of screening . Based on this conversation , the medical organization says , average-risk women should then determine whether they wish to be screened every one or two years . Screening mammography should continue until a woman is 75 years old , at which point shared decision making should again inform her decisions regarding continued screening . In a statement made following the issuance of ACOG s revised breast cancer screening guidelines , Christopher M. Zahn , M.D. , and the vice president of practice activities for ACOG , said , Our new guidance considers each individual patient and her values . Given the range of current recommendations , we have moved toward encouraging obstetrician gynecologists to help their patients make personal screening choices from a range of reasonable options . Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women .

		"paragraph": "On Saturday night , President Trump was busy in Harrisburg , Pa. , where he gave a performance of Donald s Greatest Hits , such as Get him outta here ! Get him out ! this , bellowed at security guards to oust a protester . Yes , 100 days in he s become really presidential . Trump ran away to Harrisburg to avoid Washington s White House Correspondents Dinner . Meanwhile , all the cool kids were tuned to TBS , where Samantha Bee was hosting Full Frontal With Samantha Bee s Not the White House Correspondents Dinner . An hour-plus of anti-Trump hate-glee , Bee s comedy felt like a relief after watching the president spew more venom than Bee could manufacture with a roomful of staff writers . Bee performed before an audience that filled the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington , D.C. Trump ran away from the Vietnam War , he ran away from two different Republican debates , and now he s run away from the Correspondents Dinner , said Bee . I guess we know why he wears those lumpy , ill-fitting old man pants : It s because he s constantly s ** tting himself . She was almost equally unsparing in her criticism of CNN and its leader , Jeff Zucker . Talking in front of a picture of Zucker and Trump hugging during their NBC Apprentice days , Bee said , Zucker s greatest success â€¦ is filling airtime between car crashes with a reality show loosely based on the news , where loyal , partisan hacks make us measurably dumber by spewing mendacious nonsense while a hologram of Anderson Cooper stands by . An In Memoriam segment was devoted to Bill O Reilly and his equally fired Fox News boss , priapic propagandist Roger Ailes , who , said Bee , were taken from us far too late . She noted that those Fox men , accused of sexual harassment , were punished with $ 65 million and age-appropriate retirement ah , justice ! The hour was more uneven than a typical half-hour episode of Full Frontal . An appearance by Will Ferrell , pulling his Saturday Night Live impersonation of George W. Bush out of mothballs , went on too long . ( It was the kind of performance that , in its broadness and slowness , was designed for the audience in the far seats in Constitution Hall , not for TV viewers at home . ) A taped bit with Allison Janney reprising her C.J. Cregg character from The West Wing , conducting a comic press briefing , was also rather flat . Much better was a Man in the High Castle spoof that imagined an alternate reality in which Hillary Clinton won the presidency and Bee was seen roasting her , jesting about her giving Anthony Weiner an ambassadorship , and noting that Hillary raised eyebrows when she put her son-in-law in charge of brokering peace in the Middle East . I m just kidding ! How stupid would that be ? The best pretaped bits were a series of mini-roasts Bee pretended she had done of earlier presidents . My favorite was her 1960s Laugh-In style Sock It to President Nixon . Acting like Jo Anne Worley wielding Phyllis Diller s cigarette holder , Bee insulted Nixon and that old war criminal Henry Kissinger . There was a serious undercurrent to Bee s work this night : roiling contempt , anger , and despair for what the absent president has done , and has now set in motion . She saluted her special guests in the audience : members of the Committee to Protect Journalists . Airing so soon after the president roused fury from his Harrisburg supporters when he sneered at the Washington media : their agenda is not your agenda , Bee s comedy was a profane corrective .

		"paragraph": "BLOOMINGTON , Minn. The single most amazing Super Bowl statistic of this era of New England Patriots dominance emerged last year . And it was n t the historic 25-point deficit the Patriots erased to beat the Falcons . That manic , historic and statistically improbable comeback delivered the Patriots a 34-28 overtime victory . As the Patriots prepare to play their eighth Super Bowl in the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era , the most amazing statistic is that a six-point margin of victory was the biggest among the Patriots five Super Bowl wins . It was also the largest total differential margin , as the Patriots losses to the Giants were by a combined seven points . Prior to the Falcons game last year , the other four Patriots Super Bowl victories came by a total of 13 points . Essentially , in seven Super Bowls , the Patriots have played seven one-possession games . They ve gone 5-2 , but easily could be 7-0 or 0-7 . Considering the Patriots Super Bowl history , the safest bet Sunday is that this will be a close game . And that s why the wise-guy money is flowing in on the Philadelphia Eagles , as the line has consistently shrunk since the conference championship games to the Patriots being favored by only 4 points . The look-ahead line came out with the Patriots favored by 7 . It came out officially with the Patriots favored by 5 and has shrunk to 4 , depending on which sports book you prefer . There have been multiple reports of bettors putting up hefty bets on the Eagles , including a $ 2 million wager on Philadelphia at the Mirage and other individual bets of $ 700,000 and $ 500,000 . [ Stream Super Bowl LII live on the Yahoo Sports mobile app ] The big bets on the Eagles are wagers on history repeating itself and the Patriots either eking out a victory or losing as a favorite . The Patriots are 3-4 against the spread in their Super Bowls and they ve come up under the over-under four times . The Patriots covered the point spread in their past two Super Bowl victories , the furious comeback over the Falcons and the improbable goal-line stand against the Seahawks three years ago . But the Patriots failed to cover in the prior four Super Bowls , two losses to the Giants ( 2012 and 2010 ) as favorites and narrow victories over the Eagles and Carolina ( 2004 and 2005 ) . The first Super Bowl victory of the Belichick-Brady era came in an epic upset of the Rams in 2002 , as the Patriots were 14-point underdogs and pulled off one of the biggest statistical upsets in Super Bowl history . ( The Patriots were also double-digit favorites against the Giants in 2008 , when they were stunned and lost their undefeated season ) . What exactly does all this mean ? Well , it could mean everything . But there s also a counter theory that explains why it could mean nothing . In Belichick s regimented vision , every season is different , every game is different and each team is distinct . This statistic exists only as an intriguing anomaly , as one Super Bowl has little to do with the next considering all the different variables players , opponents and schemes . In his on to Cincinnati world , tying together disparate Super Bowl results would be about as enjoyable as recounting an oral history of deflate-gate and Spygate . That attitude has permeated down to the players . [ Your chance to win on football s biggest day . Sign up for Squares Pick em ] Do you think any of those previous games will predict what happens in this game ? Patriots tackle Nate Solder asked . I do n t think so either . You ve got to think that the two best teams in the NFL are playing . There s going to be a high level of competition that comes down to some big plays or close plays . The bottom line is that there are infinite variables that could determine the outcome . ( Betting against Nick Foles is just as sound logic as looking at prior Super Bowl results ) . But as the line shrinks , it appears the Vegas sentiment disagrees with Solder . History says the safest bet in this Super Bowl is the Eagles and the points .

		"paragraph": "( Bloomberg ) -- Two of the biggest automakers and California officials are pushing back on the Trump administration s proposed rollback of U.S. fuel economy standards . In filings due Friday , General Motors Co. plans to propose that instead of opposing California s so-called zero emission vehicle sales mandate , federal regulators should instead embrace a nationwide electric-car sales program starting in 2021 . Honda Motor Co. , meanwhile , took exception to Trump s proposed freeze on mileage standards and called for steadily increasing requirements to continue . The formal comments to regulators mark one of the clearest signs yet of the auto industry s misgivings about the proposal to cap federal fuel-economy requirements in 2020 and unwind California s power to set its own vehicle efficiency standards and its zero-emission vehicle mandate . Almost 100,000 comments had been posted on a government website by Friday afternoon , with several hours to go before the deadline for public comment at midnight . â€˜ Can Do Better We know that we can do better than the Trump proposal , Mark Reuss , GM s executive vice president of global product development , told reporters in advance of the deadline . We know that the industry can do better than that . GM says a nationwide program could put 7 million long-range electric cars on the road and slash 375 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 , compared with existing zero-emission vehicle mandates . The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in August recommended keeping federal fuel economy requirements at 37 miles per gallon from 2020 through 2026 , instead of raising them to roughly 47 mpg by 2025 under rules adopted by the Obama administration . The agencies also want to revoke the most populous U.S. state s authority to adopt vehicle efficiency rules of its own , including its electric-car mandate . The agencies said the proposal would reduce societal costs by as much as $ 500 billion over a number of years and highway deaths by as many as 1,000 per year , in part by making newer , safer autos more affordable . Industry experts and even some on the EPA staff have questioned aspects of the proposal . The California Air Resources Board s filing called on the Trump administration to withdraw its plan . Finalizing this proposal would worsen air quality for the most vulnerable , waste billions of gallons of gasoline , forfeit our best chance to fight climate change , and results in years of uncertainty in the marketplace , thereby stifling job-creating investments , Richard Corey , the ARB s executive officer , said in a letter to federal regulators . The only clear winners from the efficiency-killing proposal are oil companies . Faulty Modeling Corey said the administration s plan was based on faulty computer modeling that erroneously inflates the cost of current regulations , and the potential traffic safety benefits of rolling them back . He also accused the Trump administration of unaccountable agency overreach in trying to rein in California s ability to regulate tailpipe greenhouse gases . This attack on states rights , he said , will be reversed by the courts . Mary Nichols , chair of the California Air Resources Board , said at a press conference on Friday that she s willing to negotiate on changes to existing rules . But she said the Trump administration has shown no flexibility , and seems determined to strip California of its authority over tailpipe emissions . I do n t see any way to take what s out there and turn it into an acceptable program , she said . California Governor Jerry Brown said the administration s plan would put the U.S. at risk of losing electric vehicle and advanced battery jobs to China and other countries that are totally committed to the technologies . Trump is saying he s defending America , while at the same time taking steps to destroy the American automobile industry , Brown said . It will not stand . He ll be out of office long before this law reaches the final determination in a court of law . EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler issued a statement saying that Nichols had promised to submit a counteroffer to the Trump plan in August but still has n t done so . It is my hope that we can continue to work together and reach one national standard that will get more Americans into newer , cleaner , and safer vehicles , he said . In his letter , Corey said California s willing to negotiate on changes to existing rules , if automakers can document them . While the auto industry sought relief from the Obama rules , carmakers view the Trump administration s response as too aggressive . They fear it could force them to build vehicles for California and 12 other states that follow similar standards , and another fleet for the rest of the nation . That , said Reuss , would be very costly , and frankly unnecessary . Automakers also worry about a drawn-out court fight . GM is taking a leadership position in at least offering an alternative to what could be this endless battle between the federal government and California , said Michelle Krebs , an Autotrader analyst . Whether the administration will accept it , that s another question . Drivers Penalized In a statement on Thursday , the free-market Institute for Energy Research said the existing standards are too aggressive , effectively requiring automakers to produce electric cars that consumers still purchase in relatively small numbers . The group supports the proposed rollback , saying manufacturers currently must raise prices of more popular autos to compensate for losses on electric vehicles , unfairly penalizing suburban and rural consumers who tend to be more concerned about driving range and reliability . California and 18 other states plan to attack the EPA and NHTSA proposal as unlawful . California Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Wednesday called it arbitrary and capricious , and said that it violates procedural requirements and EPA s statutory obligation to reduce harmful pollution . Industry Uncertainty In its comments on the U.S. proposal , Honda said it disagreed with the Trump administration s plan for revoking California s rule-making authority and that key elements of the federal government s analysis on traffic safety are flawed and should be scrapped . Honda said pursuing the administration s preferred option would bring years of uncertainty for the auto industry while state and federal regulators duke it out in court . A far better path would be for federal and state policy makers to negotiate a national program that is acceptable , if not ideal , for all parties including automakers , Honda wrote . Honda also recommended that the EPA maintain greenhouse gas targets that grow tougher each year instead of freezing them . The industry is united in its request that the agencies work out an agreement with California , Honda said in its comments . Toyota Motor Corp. said it too favors a 50-state emissions plan , saying in a statement that it is optimistic that adjustments can be made to the current regulations that will continue environmental progress , satisfy regulators and companies while avoiding a patchwork of rules . The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers also said its supports a national standard with California s continued involvement . The association of 12 automakers including GM , Toyota and Volkswagen AG urged federal regulators to set achievable standards that advance environmental and energy goals while recognizing marketplace realities . U.S. and California officials have agreed to hold talks to explore whether uniform standards nationwide can be maintained . Senior U.S. officials have also said they d like to reach a compromise , but no deal has materialized thus far . Tax Credit Krebs said GM is taking this step because it s concerned that the U.S. could fall behind Europe and Asia in the development of electric cars . The automaker is also hoping officials will enhance a $ 7,500 federal tax credit for electric-car buyers that will soon begin to be phased out over several quarters for GM , Tesla Inc. and others , she said . To be sure , GM stands to benefit if the proposal gains traction . It s readying a range of new electric cars and plans to begin an EV-based robotaxi business in the coming years . GM s proposal seeks additional consideration for electric vehicles placed into autonomous ride-hailing fleets . Some greeted GM s proposal with skepticism . David Friedman , a former NHTSA deputy administrator during the Obama administration , said in a statement that unless a national electric car mandate is coupled with stringent efficiency requirements , carmakers could still prioritize gas guzzlers and blunt emissions reductions . The devil is in the details , said Friedman , the vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports . We hope GM is truly serious about this proposal . If they are , they will support the existing GHG standards they committed to meet back in 2012 and sit down with us and other organizations to craft a proposal designed to help all consumers . Reuss said a national electric car program would ease some of the challenges that this type of vehicle presents to all automakers . It will facilitate more makers to be able to really focus on development of electric vehicles more efficiently , and take the guesswork out of what we think may or not happen , he said . We re making bets on a lot of uncertainty , which is highly destructive to capital . ( Updates with California officials , other automakers from 11th paragraph . ) -- With assistance from Jennifer A.

		"paragraph": "THOUSAND OAKS , Calif. ( AP ) -- The Los Angeles Rams looked like a team that could be playing for a long time based on how they put away the Oakland Raiders in the second half of the teams ' season opener . With an eye toward possibly playing into February , coach Sean McVay is willing to play the game to make sure the Rams are physically ready . McVay preemptively canceled Wednesday 's practice to give his team extra time to recover from a physically taxing 33-13 win at Oakland on Monday night , planning instead to hold a walkthrough similar to what the Rams did late last season in his first year in charge . Later in the week he will be ramping up the physicality heading into the team 's home opener against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday . '' We always try to do what is best for the players , and I think when you take into account what a physical game that was - that 's a physical football team that we played last night - we feel like we 've got the kind of team where we 're mature enough to be able to handle a mental day if we feel like that 's going to be best for them getting their bodies , getting their legs back underneath them for a good Thursday and Friday , and then hopefully being ready to go on Sunday against the Cardinals , '' McVay said Tuesday . That approach would seem to make sense after the Rams showed they can overcome a slow start against the Raiders . In addition to outscoring Oakland 23-0 in the second half , Los Angeles also had a 267-141 yardage advantage and held the ball for exactly 20 minutes . The Rams defense intercepted Raiders quarterback Derek Carr twice and did a better job of adjusting to Oakland 's use of tempo and formation in their first game under returning head coach Jon Gruden , something McVay credited to the adjustments made by players and defensive coordinator Wade Phillips . '' I think to be able to go through some adversity says a lot about our football team , '' McVay said . '' When you take into account the elements , the atmosphere , some of the unknown with what they presented offensively , even some different things defensively , the way that the half ended they had a lot of momentum . I thought our guys really embodied that attitude of never flinching , never blinking , and then they came out and did an excellent job in the second half . '' They also showed an improved understanding of how opponents might attack a Los Angeles defense supercharged by the offseason additions of defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh and cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters . Oakland used a heavy dose of bruising running back Marshawn Lynch in an effort to keep the Rams from getting chances to rush the quarterback , while tight end Jared Cook was the focus of the passing game with Raiders receivers held under wraps by the star defensive backs . Despite their struggles in a 24-6 loss to Washington , Arizona has the personnel to try and replicate Oakland 's approach . David Johnson is a proven asset carrying the ball or catching it out of the backfield , and tight end Ricky Seals-Jones showed signs of being a difference-maker in the passing game as a rookie . The two Cardinals targets are the kind of players the Rams might try to limit with linebacker Mark Barron , but McVay was uncertain whether he would be available after not playing against Oakland because of an ankle injury . '' He 's kind of day-to-day right now , '' McVay said . '' It 's such a tough thing as far as being able to really project and predict what he 's going to be able to do . Whether he is going to be available or not right now I think is definitely questionable and I 'll probably have a little bit more information about that as we go forward , but I thought Ramik ( Wilson ) did a nice job stepping up . You see Marqui Christian get a lot of reps in some of those known passing situations , and I thought both those two players were good for us last night . '' NOTES : Return specialist Pharoh Cooper is expected to miss several weeks because of a sprained ankle that McVay said might need to be repaired surgically . The Rams might be forced to sign a replacement for Cooper this week as his backup , wide receiver Mike Thomas , is dealing with a groin injury that McVay said could also sideline him . --- More AP NFL : https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP-NFL",

The Bloomberg News report said the chips , the size of a grain of rice , were used on equipment made for Amazon , which first alerted US authorities , and Apple , and possibly for other companies and government agencies . Bloomberg said a three-year secret investigation , which remains open , enabled spies to create a \" stealth doorway \" into computer equipment , a hardware-based entry that would be more effective and harder to detect than a software hack . Citing unnamed US officials , Bloomberg said a unit of the People 's Liberation Army were involved the operation that placed the chips on equipment manufactured in China for US-based Super Micro Computer Inc . Supermicro , according to Bloomberg , also manufactured equipment for Department of Defense data centers , the CIA 's drone operations , and onboard networks of Navy warships . The report said Amazon discovered the problem when it acquired software firm Elemental and began a security review of equipment made for Elemental by California-based Supermicro . According to Bloomberg , the spy chips were designed for motherboards -- the nerve centers for computer equipment -- used in data centers operated by Apple , Amazon Web Services and others . Apple said in a statement it \" has never found malicious chips , ' hardware manipulations ' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server . \" A statement by Amazon to AFP said that \" at no time , past or present , have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in Supermicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems . \" Supermicro could not immediately be reached for comment , but Bloomberg said the firm denied any knowledge of the espionage or investigation .",

		"paragraph": "Here s the template for President Donald Trump s tussles with manufacturers : First , he declares something about their operations outrageous and demands change on behalf of the American people . Then he threatens to punish the manufacturers . A meeting with prominent CEOs ensues , followed by assurances that everybody got along great . The final act is some kind of concession by the manufacturers that allows Trump to declare victory and move on to the next target . This is how it went with the appliance manufacturer Carrier ( UTX ) , and then with automakers including Ford ( F ) and General Motors ( GM ) . Trump threatened to punish such firms for moving jobs outside the country , and the firms responded with pledges to save or create more American jobs . But the template may not hold for Trump s latest target , the nation s biggest drugmakers . Trump has called drug prices astronomical and said drug companies are getting away with murder . Many Americans undoubtedly agree , since drug prices have been rising by much more than inflation for years . After a meeting with CEOs of drug firms including Merck ( MRK ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) , Eli Lilly ( LLY ) and Amgen ( AMGN ) , Trump followed the script , striking a friendly tone while insisting , We have to get drug prices down . We have no choice . He promised to do his part by cutting regulations on drugmakers and fostering a more favorable business climate . But Trump has limited ability to force drug prices down , and drugmakers have considerable leverage in Washington and in state capitals . Whatever victory Trump declares is likely to be shallow and fleeting . The surest way to clamp down on drug prices would be to allow Medicare , the nation s single-biggest purchaser of drugs , to negotiate prices with providers . But federal law prevents that and prospects of Congress changing that with new legislation seem remote . Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders says he ll introduce legislation this year that would allow just that , but such efforts have gone nowhere before . Neither have efforts to allow the importation of cheap drugs from Canada or other countries where prices are far lower . Big Pharma has powerful lobbyists in Washington , with campaign cash spread among hundreds of lawmakers of both parties to make sure its interests and profits are protected . Some states are considering price caps , which would mainly apply to drugs purchased through Medicaid , which is funded by state and federal money . But that would n t affect people covered on private-sector plans , and might even push up prices for drugs not subject to price caps , to compensate for lost revenue . More competition usually helps lower prices , and this is one thing Trump points to as a cure for soaring healthcare costs in general . Maybe . But there s little or no competition for some patent-protected drugs , which are usually the most expensive . And even some generic or off-patent drugs soar in price when drugmakers find clever ways to corner a market . That s what led to big controversies recently involving Mylan s Epipen and two heart drugs sold by Valeant . And if more drugs are made in the United States , at higher US labor costs , it will put upward pressure on prices as well , just as it would with electronics or automobiles . Pharmaceutical executives say reforms involving faster approval for new drugs and better pricing models would help control prices . Bob Hugin , executive chairman at Celgene ( CELG ) , recently told Yahoo Finance that value-based pricing based on a drug s actual effectiveness rather than a list price would serve patients better . Some such reforms might be included in whatever Trump has in mind to replace the Affordable Care Act , which Congress is likely to repeal this year . But Big Pharma enjoys tremendous pricing advantages that are n t likely to disappear . On this one , Trump has chosen an imposing adversary .

		"paragraph": "Stacey Abrams is trying to make history as the country s first African American female governor but the Georgia Democratic candidate said : I do n t want people to vote for me because I m black . She wants people to vote for her because she will uplift all Georgians , she said , answering a previous question from The Independent in her speech . Her voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning - Ms Abrams has campaigned in nearly every one of the 159 counties in the state - she said decades of Republican rule in the reliably red state have led to healthcare and education crises in particular . But , she and her supporters believe if they change Georgia , you can change the south ... and you can change America . If Ms Abrams defeats Republican candidate and current Secretary of State Brian Kemp it would certainly be a change for the state that has never even seen a woman hold the position of Lieutenant Governor , a glass ceiling which Ms Abrams running mate Sarah Riggs Amico wants to break . I do n t want people to vote for [ my ticket ] because we re women , Ms Abrams said in the crowded UpNext barber shop in southeastern Atlanta . Again she said they want votes on the issues of fully funding the state education system , a fact Ms Riggs Amico passionately pointed out has only happened once in the last 14 years of Republican rule and only because they think they ll lose the election this year . Ms Abrams is fiery in her delivery about improving job training and creating thousands of publicly-supported apprenticeships in the state , in part to combat the systemic problems in the state s education system and historic racism in the former Confederate state . I do n t want to hear how we have the number one film industry , have the number one transportation opportunities because our folks ca n t get those jobs because they do n t have the skills they need , she said . Ms Abrams meanwhile , has promised to improve job training and create thousands of publicly-supported apprenticeships in the state . I do n t want to hear how we have the number one film industry , have the number one transportation opportunities because our folks ca n t get those jobs because they do n t have the skills they need , she said . She wants to create 22,000 apprenticeships by 2022 because that s the future of Georgia . In the intimate setting of the barbershop , she speaks with the same fiery delivery that she uses at a large rally . Voters in both scenarios appear to connect with her in a way reminiscent of Barack Obama 's early years on the campaign trail . She combines the sometimes soaring rhetoric of the former president with the genuine earnestness and ability to connect of a small town councillor . Several people told The Independent , they were excited by Ms Abrams campaign and what she represents for the state which Democratic attorney general candidate Charlie Bailey said is the home of the civil rights movement . He told The Independent it s time for the state to take the lead in the South and perhaps change some of the misconceptions about the way conservative the region usually votes . When you set aside all the parties , he said that together with Ms Abrams , he would be able to do real life , tangible things to make people s lives better . They would start with healthcare , he said . Georgia has the highest maternal mortality rate in the state , something Ms Riggs Amico has regularly pointed out . Back in the barbershop , as one woman shouted out she was fired up and ready to go , Ms Abrams reminds the crowd that even if you do n t go vote , you re still voting . By not casting a ballot you re still voting to keep the status quo on the issues that need changing in the state , she said . Ahead of the Georgia midterms on 6 November her message appears to be getting through . A recent poll on the right-leaning Fox News put her ahead of Mr Kemp and the momentum appears to be with her .",

Do n't expect to hear anything from GLAAD for a bit longer . Yahoo has learned that the group is ratcheting down its rhetoric until the organization meets with A&E . The sides are slated to huddle next week to talk about next steps . [ Related : Why ' Duck Dynasty ' Will Thrive Post-Phil Scandal ] Meanwhile , there are the advertisers , who after some early hesitation are back in full force , pony up big bucks for the privilege of putting their commercials on \" Duck Dynasty \" when the show returns in one week . And why 's that ? Because : Money . Filthy lucre . Dolla dolla bills . Lotsa de casha . In other words according to ad agencies , celebrity branding experts and industry analysts \" Duck Dynasty \" delivers so many eyeballs in such a desirable demographic that A&E and advertisers have weighed the pros versus possible cons and seen â€¦ too many pros to care .

The voices in support just seem to be louder . \" Indeed , Duck Dynasty , with its faux-golly-gee-redneck sensibility and familiar , sitcom-like staging , is huge .

		"paragraph": "CHARLESTON , W.Va . ( AP ) In public , West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Allen Loughry gave speeches about honesty and integrity in government . In private , federal prosecutors say , he was raking in money by defrauding others . FBI agents arrested Loughry on Wednesday morning and took him to the federal courthouse in Charleston to face a 22-count federal indictment . U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart said Loughry , who was suspended from the bench earlier this month , is charged with 16 counts of mail fraud , two counts of wire fraud , one count of witness tampering and three counts of making false statements to a federal agent . The indictment says his fraud scheme began in 2013 , shortly after he was elected . \" It 's a solemn day for West Virginia , \" Stuart said . \" The West Virginia Supreme Court should be and must be above reproach , even above the slightest appearance of impropriety . \" If convicted on all counts , Stuart said Loughry faces a possible sentence of up to 395 years and a fine of up to $ 5.5 million . According to the indictment , the charges stem from Loughry making personal use of a state vehicle and credit card , including trips to book signings and to visit family . It says Loughry also sought mileage reimbursements for trips even though he drove a state vehicle and used a government credit card for gas . The indictment also accuses him of moving a leather couch and a historic , valuable desk from the Supreme Court office to his home during office renovations and of lying to federal agents about his actions and trying to influence an employee 's testimony . Loughry was suspended from the bench without pay earlier this month after a state Judicial Investigation Commission filed a 32-count complaint with the court alleging he \" made false statements with the deliberate attempt to deceive \" concerning his involvement in the renovation of his office . The complaint also said he failed to tell other justices about a federal subpoena , and it contained the accusations about moving office furniture to his home and improperly using state vehicles . Loughry 's attorney , John A. Carr , declined to comment . Loughry has repeatedly denied involvement in the office renovations . One such denial came during an appearance before the House Committee on Finance in January . Gov. Jim Justice and other public officials had urged Loughry to resign if the complaints were accurate . Republican Senate President Mitch Carmichael called on him to resign immediately Wednesday . \" There is an established system in place to adjudicate and fairly resolve this matter , \" Carmichael said in a statement . \" Nevertheless , the confidence and workmanship in the judicial branch of government must be held to the highest standards of propriety and respect . Therefore , Justice Loughry should immediately resign his position as Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals . \" Loughry was a Supreme Court law clerk for nine years before being elected to the court in 2012 . Before that he was a senior assistant attorney general and a special prosecutor . Loughry wrote a 2006 book chronicling West Virginia political corruption . Fighting corruption became a major theme of his 2012 court campaign . The federal indictment says Loughry 's scheme to defraud started unraveling in August 2016 in a dispute with another justice about vehicle usage . It says news outlets began investigating \" extraordinary spending \" by the Supreme Court in the fall of 2017 and reported on the missing leather couch among other things . Authorities say Loughry returned the couch the day after the report and returned the desk three days later . He was removed as chief justice in February after the justices learned that he had kept the federal subpoena secret .",

This is not the first time that a weapon has been accidentally fired during a gun lesson resulting in an injury . In March , a teacher at a Northern California school accidentally fired a gun while teaching a public safety class , injuring a 17-year-old student . Dennis Alexander , a Seaside City s mayor pro tem and a reserve officer with the Sand City Police Department , pointed his handgun toward the ceiling and accidentally discharged it . The student was injured by a bullet fragment or by debris from the ceiling . In 2017 , a Detroit firearms instructor shot and wounded a man who was attending a gun training class . The instructor unholstered his pistol , pointed it at the door separating two classrooms , and fired a round . A man in another classroom was struck in both his legs .

		"paragraph": "Starting in July , Australians will be blocked from ordering items on Amazon s United States site . The company said today that shoppers in Australia will be redirected to its local site , Amazon.com.au , and that its international sites , including Amazon.com , will no longer ship to Australian addresses . The change is in response to a new tax regulation that goes into effect on July 1 and requires businesses earning more than $ 75,000 AUD a year to charge Australia 's 10 % Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) on low value items imported by consumers . Called the Amazon tax , the new policy was introduced following concerns about the impact of Amazon and other large overseas e-commerce businesses on Australian retailers , who have to apply GST to all products they sell . A loophole in tax regulations , however , means that the GST is currently applied only to items purchased from overseas retailers if they are worth $ 1,000 AUD or more , which many local companies argued gave Amazon , eBay and other overseas competitors an unfair advantage . Amazon launched its Australian site last December and says it currently has 60 million products , a fraction of the estimated 500 million products that are listed on Amazon s U.S. site . As a placation , Australian customers will also have access to 4 million products that were previously available only on Amazon.com through its new Global Store . In a statement emailed to TechCrunch , an Amazon spokesperson said :",

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) The publisher of The New York Times says he took President Donald Trump to task for \" deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric \" that is \" not just divisive but increasingly dangerous \" when the two met privately at the White House this month . Trump disclosed the meeting on Twitter on Sunday , saying he and A.G. Sulzberger \" Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase , ' Enemy of the People . ' Sad ! \" \" Enemy of the People \" is the phrase Trump uses to broadly describe most journalists . He said the July 20 meeting was \" very good and interesting . \" Sulzberger , who succeeded his father in the role on Jan. 1 , said his main purpose for accepting the meeting was to \" raise concerns about the president 's deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric . \" \" I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous , \" he said . Sulzberger said he told Trump that while the phrase \" fake news \" is untrue and harmful , \" I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists ' the enemy of the people . ' I warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence . \" Sulzberger said he stressed to Trump that leaders of other countries have adopted his rhetoric to justify cracking down on journalists . He was accompanied to the meeting by James Bennet , the Times ' editorial page editor . \" I warned that it was putting lives at risk , that it was undermining the democratic ideals of our nation , and that it was eroding one of our country 's greatest exports : a commitment to free speech and a free press , \" the publisher said . Sulzberger added that he made clear to Trump that he was not asking him to soften his attacks on the Times if he thinks the newspaper is being unfair . \" Instead , I implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism , which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country , \" he said . Trump reads the Times and gives interviews to its reporters , but regularly derides the newspaper as the \" failing New York Times . \" The Times ownership company in May reported a 3.8 percent increase in first-quarter revenue compared to the same period in 2017 . The president , who lashes out over media coverage he thinks is unfair , has broadly labeled the news media the \" enemy of the people \" and regularly accuses reporters of spreading \" fake news \" his term for stories he dislikes . Hours after the tweet about the Sulzberger meeting , Trump lobbed fresh attacks against the media in a series of posts that included a pledge not to let the country \" be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the ... dying newspaper industry . \" Trump also accused reporters of disclosing \" internal deliberations of government \" that can endanger \" the lives of many . \" He cited no examples but wrote \" Very unpatriotic ! \" and said freedom of the press \" comes with a responsibility to report the news ... accurately , \" a sentiment journalists share . Trump also claimed that 90 percent of the coverage of his administration is negative , leading to an \" all time low \" in public confidence in the media . He cited the Times and The Washington Post , two repeat targets , and claimed , \" They will never change ! \" Last week , Trump told hundreds of people attending the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City , Missouri : \" Do n't believe the crap you see from these people , the fake news , \" as he gestured toward journalists at the back of the room . He also told them to remember \" what you 're seeing and what you 're reading is not what 's happening . \" Sulzberger said he accepted the invitation to meet Trump because Times publishers have a history of meeting with presidential administrations and other public figures who have concerns with the publication 's coverage of them . He said he decided to comment after Trump revealed that they had met . The White House had asked for the meeting to be kept off the record .

		"paragraph": "A heat wave has blanketed several parts of the country recently , and now it s affecting the West . More than 25 million people in California , Nevada , and Arizona are under excessive heat watches , warnings , or advisories . The National Weather Service is encouraging people in Los Angeles to be aware of the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke and to try to stay cool as much as possible . The American Red Cross offers a list of things people should do to be safe during a heat wave , including obvious recommendations , such as drinking plenty of fluids , staying indoors , wearing loose-fitting and light-colored clothing , avoiding strenuous exercise outside during the hottest part of the day , and taking frequent breaks if you work outside . But some of its other advice is a little confusing . Among other things , the Red Cross says it s important to follow these guidelines in a heat wave : These are n t arbitrary recommendations , health expert Jennifer Wider , MD , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Both alcohol and caffeine are diuretics and can promote fluid loss , further exacerbating your chances of dehydration , she says . Smaller meals may be better than larger meals during a heat wave because larger meals take longer to digest and could generate excess heat in your body , Wider explains . As for avoiding extreme temperature changes , there is some evidence that going from very hot to very cold temperatures can put stress on the body and cause dry eyes , respiratory issues , and muscle spasms , especially in people who are sick or have compromised immune systems , Wider says . That sounds hard to do when you re moving from scorching temperatures outside to air conditioning indoors , but Wider says setting your thermostat to 75 degrees or so will help ( and it may also keep your AC from being too taxed in the heat ) . Since it s unlikely that people are going to give up their daily cup of coffee , change up their eating habits due to the weather , and keep from rushing into air conditioning when it s sweltering outside , exactly how important are these unusual tips ? They re helpful but not crucial for the average person who does n t have an underlying illness , Wider says . In general , it s really important to try to limit your exposure to extreme heat , stay well hydrated , and avoid exercising outdoors in a heat wave , Brian Schulz , MD , sports medicine specialist at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . When you re exercising , you re also elevating your body temperature , he explains . Your body already has a harder time controlling its temperature when it s hot outside . It s important to look out for early signs of heat exhaustion , such as dry mouth , stopping sweating when you should be sweating , getting chills , and feeling exhausted or fatigued , Schulz says . If you have any of those , you need to drink plenty of fluids and get indoors immediately . Common sense is important , and using it during a heat wave should keep you safe . Just do n t take these precautions lightly , Wider says . Heat exhaustion and heat stroke can happen to anyone .

		"paragraph": "Red carpet fashion has taken on a whole new meaning in 2018 . At this Sunday s Golden Globes , actresses are expected to dress in all black on the red carpet , in a silent protest of sexual harassment . Now , we ve learned that they may also be wearing a more explicit accessory : a Time s Up solidarity pin . The pin is a reference to the Time s Up movement spearheaded by A-listers like Shonda Rhimes , Reese Witherspoon , and Emma Stone . The new organization has already raised over $ 14 million toward a legal defense fund for women experiencing harassment across industries . According to the Hollywood Reporter , allies will raise awareness for the movement with a pin curated by Reese Witherspoon and designed by Arianne Phillips , the costume designer behind Kingsman and Nocturnal Animals . Reese asked me to come to the actors group , and told me they were going to be wearing black and would I consider creating a pin for the nominees and male presenters , Phillips told THR . We were up against the holidays , but I said I could do it , and the first person I called was my partner in crime , [ Los Angeles jewelry designer ] Michael Schmidt . In just two weeks , Phillips and Schmidt designed the pin and made up 500 to be worn on the red carpet . While the sexual harassment allegations may be breaking ground in Hollywood , this is hardly the first time political sentiments have been expressed on the red carpet . At last year s Oscars , Emma Stone , Lin-Manuel Miranda , Ruth Negga , and Karlie Kloss wore blue ribbons in solidarity with the ACLU . Dakota Johnson and Emma Stone added logo pins to support Planned Parenthood to their red carpet looks . Others , like Brad Goreski and the cast of Moonlight , wore ampersand pins as a gesture of support for GLAAD ( the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ) . Some even chose to make a political statement with their entire outfit . At last year s Grammy Awards , Joy Villa wore an American flag-themed dress emblazoned with the Trump campaign slogan Make America Great Again . ( She s since filed a sexual assault complaint against Corey Lewandowski , Trump s former campaign manager . ) Ava DuVernay shared a photo of herself with hoodie still up to remember Trayvon Martin on the day of the Oscars . With the Time s Up movement at the forefront of attention in Hollywood and an industry stylist behind the initiative , we expect to see a lot of activism on the red carpet .

		"paragraph": "Months â€¦ been waiting months for the conclusion to the April Season 6 finale cliffhanger of The Walking Dead , the one that teased viewers that one of their favorite characters was about to meet the business end of a stabby , barbed-wire-covered baseball bat . And on Oct. 23 , we learn we should be careful what we wish for , because while you can currently play a version of Schr dinger s Cat with your fave member of Rick Grimes s group they re alive until you see the episode after the Season 7 premiere , that will no longer be the case for ( at least ) one of the gang . Because AMC and the cast and crew of the show worked so hard to keep that big death under wraps for the premiere , definitive details on the new season have been scarce , but here are a few things we know as we head into a premiere that threatens to make us long for the days before ( a character to be named later ) got ( his or her ) brains scrambled by Negan . 1 . Season 7 will consist of 16 episodes , broken into two eight-episode half-seasons . The 66-minute , Oct. 23 season premiere , The Day Will Come When You Wo n t Be , was written by showrunner Scott Gimple , directed by EP and special effects whiz Greg Nicotero , and will Gimple promised at New York Comic Con reveal the answer to the Season 6 cliffhanger of who big baddie Negan beat to death with his barbedwire-covered baseball bat , Lucille . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead : Relive the Fish Tank Fight With Danai Gurira in Retrospective Sneak Peek 2 . About Negan s victim â€¦ Those present in the semicircle of doom are , from left to right , Glenn , Rosita , Daryl , Michonne , Abraham , Maggie , Rick , Sasha , Aaron , Carl , and Eugene . We re almost certain Rick and Carl are safe because Negan instructed his crew to cut the boy s other eye out and feed it to his father if anyone moved or said anything during his impending fatal beatdown of someone in the semicircle , suggesting his Eeny , Meeny , Miny , Moe winner would not be either of them . As for the rest of the lineup , no one else can be ruled out , but most fan polls reveal that viewers think we ll be bidding a crushing farewell to Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) or Abraham ( Michael Cudlitz ) , or Glenn and Abraham , during the premiere . 3 . Other characters we can breathe easy about ( for now ) : Carol and Morgan , who were headed off on their own adventure at the end of Season 6 . The pair , who are still at odds about their opposing philosophies on killing in the apocalypse , will spend the early part of the season away from Rick s group , as they join the Kingdom . TWD comic book fans know about the Kingdom , a survivor community led by a theatrical man named Ezekiel , who insists on being called King Ezekiel and who keeps a pet tiger , Shiva , by his side . Ezekiel will be played by Teen Titans and General Hospital actor Khary Payton , while Shiva will be played by CGI . 4 . The Kingdom is bigger than Alexandria , in terms of population , and will be one of four communities ( at least ) that factor into Season 7 and help expand the worldview of Rick and his group . We may get a glimpse of the Kingdom in the season premiere , but will most likely really delve into the community and its citizenry in the second or third episode of the season ( an episode directed by Nicotero ) . The second episode , The Well , will be another extended installment , clocking in at 76 minutes . In addition to Alexandria and the Kingdom , stories will also unfold at the Hilltop and at Negan s Saviors HQ , which Rick and company thought they had destroyed in Season 6 . They will find out early in Season 7 that the Saviors are much stronger , deadlier , organized , and populated than they naively believed . Related : See â€˜ The Walking Dead Season 7 Photos 5 . The Hilltop , led by Gregory ( Xander Berkeley ) , may not continue an alliance with the Alexandrians in Season 7 , especially when Gregory finds out that Rick and his group failed in their mission to kill Negan and stop the Saviors from pillaging the Hilltop and its supplies . And that could leave Jesus ( Tom Payne ) , the Hilltop recruiter who helped broker the deal between Rick s group and Gregory , torn between his home and his new friends in Alexandria . 6 . Berkeley , who was promoted to series regular status for Season 7 , is part of the largest cast of regulars in TWD history . Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Negan , Payne , and Austin Amelio , as Daryl Dixon s nemesis Dwight , were also upped to regular status for Season 7 , joining Lauren Cohan ( Maggie ) , Cudlitz , Seth Gilliam ( Gabriel ) , Danai Gurira ( Michonne ) , Lennie James ( Morgan ) , Andrew Lincoln ( Rick ) , Melissa McBride ( Carol ) , Josh McDermitt ( Eugene ) , Ross Marquand ( Aaron ) , Sonequa Martin-Green ( Sasha ) , Alanna Masterson ( Tara ) , Austin Nichols ( Spencer ) , Norman Reedus ( Daryl ) , Chandler Riggs ( Carl ) , Christian Serratos ( Rosita ) , and Yeun to make up the 20-person regular cast . 7 . Among the members of the recurring cast for the new season : Corey Hawkins , whose Heath left on a supply run with Tara after the Alexandrians attacked a Saviors base in Not Tomorrow Yet . Though he s the star of Fox s upcoming 24 reboot , 24 : Legacy , Hawkins will appear in at least one Season 7 episode of TWD , made possible by the fact that both series film near Atlanta . 8 . That super-intense Season 7 premiere scene that AMC debuted at New York Comic Con earlier this month gave viewers a hint at just how tragic and emotional the fallout of the Negan killing will be , especially after Rick promises to kill Negan , only to have the bat-carrying baddie give him a speech about the importance of having a right-hand man and drag him off to an RV with a hatchet tucked into his belt . Could one of the comic book s other iconic moments when Rick loses his hand finally happen ? Producers have long maintained that such a development would be completely impractical and expensive from a special effects POV . But it would also come as another blow to a now devastated Rick and his crew , whose confidence was at an all-time high before that tragic formation of the semicircle of doom . And while the Governor was the chopper-offer of the hand in the comics , it would seem appropriately dramatic for Negan to do the deed now , just so he can be totally sure he s put a big thorn in the side of the Ricktatorship . 9 . If there remains any doubt about just how devastating the events of the season premiere will be , consider the inspiration for the episode s title . In the Season 1 TWD finale , CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner ( The Americans star Noah Emmerich ) wants to blow up the building with Rick and his people inside , thus sparing them the horrors of the apocalypse . Rick pleads with Jenner to allow his people to flee before he blows himself up , and when Jenner agrees , Rick tells him he s grateful . The day will come when you wo n t be , Jenner replies , and this , the day on which Negan murders a beloved member of the Grimes gang , is that day that Jenner insisted would be worse than dying in an exploding building . So , yeah . Devastating . 10 . The series has already been renewed for Season 8 , which will premiere in the fall of 2017 with the 100th episode of The Walking Dead . The Season 5 premiere featured the cannibalism of Terminus and Carol s heroic ( and kickass ) rescue of her friends the Season 6 premiere featured Rick s group trying to clear hundreds of zombies from the walker pit and the Season 7 premiere will include what promises to be the most heartbreaking death ever . What will they possibly do for Episode 100 ? The Walking Dead Season 7 premieres Oct. 23 at 9 p.m. on AMC . ",

Skylar , of Hoffman , Minn. , was watching her father , Brian Hedstrom , mow their lawn on June 9 when he ran over a tool . He told the St. Paul , Minn. , Pioneer Press that he s not a pick-up-sticks-before-he-mows kind of guy , but he certainly wishes he had been that day . The tool caused the blade of the lawnmower to detach and fly backward , where it hit Skylar . My wife came running up to me , waving her arms and screaming , pointing to [ Skylar ] , Hedstrom said . I jumped off , turned around and she was standing there , covered in blood . It was the scariest thing I ve seen in my whole life . Hedstrom said he reached his daughter in what seemed to be one leap and was immediately on the ground holding her wound together . After he called 911 , she was transported to a hospital in Alexandria , Minn. , and then was transferred to Sanford Medical Center Fargo in North Dakota to see a specialized pediatric neurologist and cranial doctor . But that ambulance ride is where Skylar s winning personality stood out to her father .

		"paragraph": "It might have been the night s most predictable result , but Leonardo DiCaprio s Best Actor win for his role in The Revenant still felt like Oscar doing right by a guy nominated five times before , first for What s Eating Gilbert Grape ? back in 1993 , when he was 19 . Fox s campaign for The Revenant focused heavily on how much DiCaprio suffered for his art all crawling around in the dirt , chewing on raw bison liver and braving sub-zero temperatures . He beat out four actors whose films , at least , featured plenty of indoor shooting : Bryan Cranston for Trumbo , Matt Damon for The Martian , Michael Fassbender for Steve Jobs and last year s winner Eddie Redmayne for The Danish Girl . But for all the surety of his win this season DiCaprio had picked up every major acting prize on his route to the Dolby Theatre the 41-year-old actor still was visibly relieved when the envelope was opened . The Revenant was the product of an unbelievable cast and crew , he said in his speech . First off to my brother in this endeavor , Mr. Tom Hardy . Tom , your fierce talent onscreen can only be surpassed by your friendship offscreen . To Mr. Alejandro Inarritu , as the history of cinema unfolds , you have forged your way into history these past two years . What an unbelievable talent you are . Thank you to you and Chivo [ cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ] for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us . DiCaprio thanked Fox and New Regency and called out Arnon Milchan before thanking people from the very onset of his career , including Michael Caton-Jones , who cast him in This Boy s Life , his regular collaborator Martin Scorsese and Rick Yorn . And to my parents : None of this would be possible without you . In fact , DiCaprio revealed on the red carpet earlier that he d brought his mom with him tonight . In Mike Fleming Jr s interview with the Oscar winner published this month , he revealed she would drive 45 minutes each way , twice a day , just to take DiCaprio to a better school . RelatedAlejandro Innaritu Wins Best Director Oscar For â€˜ The Revenant He finished his speech with a climate-change plea . Making The Revenant was about man s relationship to the natural world , a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history , he said . Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow . Climate change is real . It is happening right now . It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species , and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating . We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations , but who speak for all of humanity , for the indigenous people of the world , for the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this , for our children s children , and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed . I thank you all for this amazing award tonight . Let us not take this planet for granted . I do not take tonight for granted . The Revenant follows DiCaprio s Hugh Glass , a fur trapper abandoned by his colleagues after he s savagely attacked by a bear . Left for dead and double-crossed , Glass crawls his way to safety , dodging Native American warriors and fixing to take his revenge on Hardy s John Fitzgerald , who murdered his son and conspired to take his share . RelatedOscar Winners By Film & Studio Chart Backstage , DiCaprio continued the climate-change thread by relating it to the upcoming presidential election . If you do n t believe in climate change , you do n t believe in modern science or truth and you ll be on the wrong side of this issue , he said . We need to vote for leaders who recognize the truth and will do something about it . He reflected on the support he d received on his road to the Oscars , in response to a question that mentioned the public White House petition that called for President Obama to step in and give him the award . It all feels incredibly surreal , he said . It s surreal because you ca n t reach out and physically meet everybody . You hear it on the Internet and from other people , and the truth is we always strive for the best in what we do , but this year I ve been overwhelmed with such support by so many fans and so many people in the industry . It s shocking actually and what can I say except I m very grateful . He came backstage with his director , who also won tonight , and thanked three-time winner Lubezki . It s incredible that two outsiders like Chivo and Alejandro stuck to their beliefs and here we have two - and three-time winners . These guys represent everything the industry should be .

		"paragraph": "Dear President Trump , On July 16 , you will have your first official summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin . You will surely be advised by many wise people and also bring your own thoughts about how to deal with him . I d like to offer a perspective that you probably are n t getting anywhere else . I have a lot of experience dealing with Putin . For the last 10 years , I ve been his number one foreign enemy . My unenviable position started with the death of my lawyer , Sergei Magnitsky , in 2009 at the hands of the Russian state after he had uncovered a massive Russian government corruption scheme . It culminated with the Obama administration s passage of the Magnitsky Act in 2012 , which froze the assets and withheld the visas of people violating human rights in Russia . The work has been daunting . Sergei has n t been the only victim of Putin s regime . The way I see it , there s quite the pattern : His regime murdered Boris Nemtsov , a Russian opposition politician who advocated for Sergei s killers to be sanctioned by the West I believe they murdered Alexander Perepilichnyy , a whistleblower who died suddenly in the United Kingdom after coming forward with financial details on the criminal group behind Sergei s murder they attempted to murder the Magnitsky family lawyer in Moscow when he was thrown off a four story building ( thankfully he survived ) and they also attempted to poison Vladimir Kara-Murza , Boris Nemtsov s prot g , who traveled the West trying to secure Magnitsky sanctions against the Putin regime . Everyone knows these are n t the only murders , detentions , and disappearances ordered by the Russian leader . Based on all of this , there are a few things you need to know about Putin . Putin has a weak hand and is always bluffing . Just by meeting him , you re giving him a huge gift . The President of the United States is the most important and powerful person in the free world in contrast , the President of Russia is practically nobody . The Russian economy is roughly equivalent to the state of New York s . The Russian military budget is 90 % less than that of the United States , on par with the U.K. or France . All of Putin s geopolitical theatrics are him showing his weakness . At best , he s got a pair of twos . The United States has a full house . Putin is a bald-faced liar . You ca n t believe a word Putin tells you . His track record of lying is legendary and well-documented . He lied about the little green men invading Crimea he lied about Russia taking away Syria s chemical weapons he lied about who shot down MH17 he lied about Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics he lied about the recent poisoning of the Skripals in the United Kingdom and he lied about Russian involvement in the recent U.S. , U.K. , French , German , and Italian elections . Whatever he tells you , it s not true . Putin does n t negotiate . Whatever you offer will simply become the beginning point of your next negotiation . Do n t be offended when he does this to you . He does it to everybody . In 2001 , President George W. Bush famously looked Putin in the eye and saw his soul . Last year , I had lunch with President Bush and asked him about it . In short , he said that each of their dozens of following meetings and conversations were disastrous . In 2009 , President Barack Obama tried to clean up the situation by offering Russia a reset . All that did was embolden Putin further . He knew that he could operate with impunity and that the United States would n t do a thing . Putin views compromise and engagement as weakness . Any offer of these will lead to him doing more malicious and awful things around the world . Putin has the temperament of a cold-blooded killer . Most civilized people ca n t imagine what he is capable of . He s not like any leader of a sovereign state , but more like drug lord Pablo Escobar but with nukes . In one afternoon , Putin likely goes from discussing tax policy with his economic advisers to planning targeted assassinations of dissidents and business competitors with his secret police . Putin values money far more than human life . I ve discovered that the only way to touch Putin is by going after his money and the money of his cronies . I figured this out with Magnitsky sanctions . These have been enacted by the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , and the Baltic states . Since Putin and his officials kill people and steal money in Russia , and then keep that money in the West , Magnitsky sanctions put at risk his entire mafia-like operation . Mr. President , the only way to deal with a person like Vladimir Putin is to contain him , not to engage him . He will lie to you , flatter you , trick you and betray you . The only message to you can give him in Helsinki on July 16 is that America is a proud and strong country which can and will stop him . Sincerely , William Browder Head of the Magnitsky Global Justice Campaign",

		"paragraph": "LAS VEGAS Mixed martial arts superstar Jon Jones tested positive for benzoylecgonine , the main metabolite in cocaine , on Dec. 4 , 2014 , a month before his successful light heavyweight title defense last week against Daniel Cormier at the MGM Grand Garden . The Nevada Athletic Commission learned of Jones ' positive test when it received the results from Sports Medicine Research & Testing Laboratory of Salt Lake City on Dec. 23 . The commission had randomly tested Jones early in the month as part of its initiative to more stringently fight performance-enhancing drug usage in combat sports . So the commission knew that Jones tested positive a month prior to his fight , yet : Jones was permitted to fight Cormier as scheduled . He made his entire $ 500,000 purse , minus the $ 50,000 that the commission deducted for his role in an Aug. 4 brawl with Cormier after a news conference . He wo n't face any punishment in the form of a fine or a suspension . The win over Cormier will remain in the record books . Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. did not have it so easy when he smoked marijuana prior to a fight with Sergio Martinez in 2012 . Marijuana metabolites were discovered in Chavez 's urine following a drug test that was administered to him on Sept. 15 , 2012 , the night of his middleweight title fight with Martinez at the Thomas & Mack Center . Chavez admitted his usage and was fined $ 900,000 and suspended for nine months by the Nevada commission . After the threat of a lawsuit for an excessive fine , the fine was reduced to $ 100,000 , but Chavez still served the nine-month suspension . The discrepancy between the two situations led thousands of fans to howl in protest Tuesday . They blasted the commission for ineptitude , ripped the UFC and president Dana White and wound up posing a peculiar question : \" Why does the Nevada Athletic Commission bar marijuana but permit cocaine ? \" It 's all very complicated , but the Nevada commission is hardly comprised of the unenlightened fools that reporters and fans are making its five members out to be . The Nevada commission did nothing because it had no legal authority to do anything . Period . Nevada follows the World Anti-Doping Agency code on drug testing matters . In the 2015 WADA Code , it defines in-competition and out-of-competition testing a very important distinction . According to Appendix One of the WADA code , in-competition is defined thusly : \" Unless provided otherwise in the rules of an international Federation or the ruling body of the event in question , ' In-Competition ' means the period commencing twelve hours before a Competition in which the athlete is scheduled to participate through the end of such Competition and the Sample collection process related to such Competition . \" The definition of out-of-competition is a little easier to understand : \" Any period which is not In-Competition . \" Given that Jones was tested more than 12 hours before his bout , he was considered out-of-competition . And that 's where the WADA prohibited list comes into play . Cocaine is banned by the WADA list only in-competition . That simple fact is crucial to understanding this . Chavez 's positive test came on the night of the fight , or in-competition . Jones ' positive test was out-of-competition . Given its adherence to the WADA code , the commission can legally only penalize Jones for using cocaine in-competition . Given that his positive test came out-of-competition , its hands were tied and it was legally barred from taking action . The unanswerable question at this stage is why a test was conducted for street drugs . No one at the commission can answer that and it appears that the test was done erroneously . One person familiar with the procedures involved in anti-doping said a test for recreational drugs , or so-called drugs of abuse , would not be following the WADA Code and thus should n't have been done . The commission faced a conundrum once it received Jones ' test result . It had a known cocaine user only days out from a mega-fight and it was powerless to do anything . Nonetheless , the commission had Jones tested a second time about a week later . Commission chairman Francisco Aguilar said he is not certain of the exact date of the second test , but said it was \" about a week later , Dec. 11 or Dec. 12 . \" Jones passed that test , meaning the cocaine metabolites were out of his system . According to WebMD , while cocaine itself passes quickly through the body , its metabolites last longer and can be detected via testing of hair samples for up to several months . It noted , \" Urine tests check for metabolic byproducts of cocaine , and in infrequent users a urine test is positive for up to two to three days after cocaine use . However , in those who use cocaine regularly , a urine test may be positive for two weeks after the last use . Hair samples can detect cocaine for several months after using . \" So Jones likely used at a time when he was in full blown training for a fight with his most hated rival . That a young , rich athlete uses cocaine is hardly a story . But the fact that Jones , who in 2012 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence , would be taking cocaine during training camp is troubling . He entered a rehabilitation facility in New Mexico on Monday in an effort to solve the problem . Jones was plenty smug and cocky , and his mannerisms turn off tens of thousands of fans , but only the most hard-hearted among us would not wish him well and hope he 's able to break free of whatever substance problem he is facing . The UFC has to make a choice , though . Jones ' positive test for cocaine would seem to subject him to discipline under its Fighter Code of Conduct , which lists substance abuse as one of many examples of misconduct that could put an athlete afoul of the code . However , the UFC does n't appear to have had the ability to pull Jones from the bout . Given that Jones did not violate any rules , he had a signed contract and was ready , willing , able and eager to fight . Had the UFC attempted to yank him from the card , Jones could easily have sought an injunction to permit him to fight , and he would have had a strong case . The irony in all this is that the Nevada commission had planned to speak about out-of-competition drug testing at its meeting on Jan. 12 . In light of the Jones situation , that is going to become a significant hearing . It will have to decide if it wants to abandon the WADA Code , which governs major sporting events such as the Olympics around the world , to make street drugs such as cocaine illegal at all times . It promises to be a heated debate , though it is almost certain no action will be taken on Monday no matter how the talk goes . This scenario , though , shows the enormity of the issues facing regulators in their anti-doping enforcement efforts . But regular , random , unannounced testing is so critical to the long-term health of combat sports that despite the troubles that arise , the UFC ca n't abandon plans to drug test its athletes and the commission should only consider ramping up its program . Cheaters and abusers are running rampant to quit testing would simply allow them to win .",

		"paragraph": "By 60 , most people are dreaming of retirement full-time . Not Ron Cephas Jones . With five TV gigs since 2015 This Is Us , Luke Cage , The Get Down , Mr. Robot , and Banshee the actor is busier than he s ever been since he started auditioning in the early 90s , and he could n t be more tickled . I m having the time of my life , getting to portray characters I really enjoy spending time with , Jones says . I do n t exactly know why it is happening now , but I will take it gladly . Jones who made Yahoo TV s list of the Top 20 Character Actors Working Today spoke with us about his process , taking This Is Us s William from supporting role to star turn to superb death scene ( pay attention , Emmy voters ! ) . He also admitted that he was not really ready for William to say the last goodbye and made our day when he confirmed the character would be resurrected , in some capacity , in Season 2 . Yahoo TV : You have been working fairly consistently in film , TV , and theater since the mid-1990s , but in the last two years you have been on what can only be described as a TV hot streak with a major role on This Is Us and important ( often simultaneous ) recurring roles on Luke Cage , Mr. Robot , and The Get Down . The work has always been worthy , but now you are getting face and name recognition . What do you credit for this recent explosion ? Ron Cephas Jones : It s been interesting , a sort of roller coaster ride . But first , thank you very much for honoring and recognizing the work . That s an important element of how I ve built my career , and also a testament to the many actors [ who believe ] the idea that after all is said and done , it s always about the work . It feels great that I got to this point based on the work that I put across , whether on the stage , film , or television . It felt like a natural progression . When you re young , you want things to happen right away . And sometimes that does n t always develop in the way you want it to . But my thing was to continue to work , in whatever element I could . I got a lot of that philosophy when I started to work with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the Labyrinth Theater Company group . I ve been a member since the early 90s . It s been a culmination of all that work leading up to the last two , three years . It s sort of classic in that way . It s just another one of those stories of an actor who s worked a long time finally given an opportunity to have his work seen by a mass audience . Not to mention [ be a part of ] a hit show . I did n t see any of it coming . I knew that if I continued to do good work , eventually , the benefits , or the blessings , as I call them , that come from being an actor start to happen . Also the landscape changed with the advent of Netflix and Hulu and all this iPad stuff . It opened up . One show that I booked , [ AMC s ] Low Winter Sun , was picked up only for one season . Then Mr. Robot came up and , fortunately , I got a recurring role on that , and they kept writing more episodes for me . And then Luke Cage happened because Netflix and the USA show were filming in New York I did n t have to choose . New stages were built . I did The Get Down way down in Queens when they opened up these new soundstages . So there was a little bit more TV work in New York , and I got lucky because I was n t an L.A. based actor . Then , the next audition was with This Is Us . It happened to be filming in Los Angeles . That s what brought me out here . Otherwise , I probably would still be in New York . Then , I got fortunate to be working for a project that ended up being a hit show and picked up for two more seasons during the first season , and that rarely happens . No one expected that . That s the truth : Critics loved the show and knew it was a hit for NBC , but that two-year order still caught people by surprise . That s a testament to [ creator ] Dan Fogelman , the directors , and his staff over there at This Is Us . [ I owe ] everybody who decided to give me an opportunity to do this role . I knew I could do the role , but there were a lot of times I auditioned for roles like this that I could n t book because I just did n t have an older look . I do n t carry any gray hair or anything like that . So a lot of times , even though they recognize the work level is there , they ll say , Well , he just looks a bit too young . I knew right away that Dan Fogelman and [ pilot directors ] John Requa and Glenn Ficarra were looking deeper because the character was so layered . They immediately grabbed on to that and said , This is what we want . And they made that clear to me after the audition [ that I gave that to them ] , so that was a great feeling too . That s never happened to me before . So it just made for a beautiful fit . Having seen you in real-life photos and in films like Half Nelson and Across the Universe , I had no idea you were technically old enough to be Sterling K. Brown s dad . I thought you were around the same age . That s where the makeup and costume teams come in and help to create a character . I ca n t say enough about how much those elements contribute to the overall character , the end product . It can be as simple as adding a pair of glasses to make you look like a smart hacker . With William , they added gray and some other signs of aging . The hat and clothes became an important part of his story . Did being 60 help you relate to William or find the character in a way that you would have had trouble with if you were doing this at a younger point in your life ? Yes . Because I m 60 , I could closer relate to who William was . I m friends with men like him . I m closer to uncles and neighborhood men that I grew up with than I am to the generation that is Sterling s . So that s the character right there . The other elements compounded the visual aspects of it . So I think that s why the character resonated so much . Because people thought I was younger , they did n t realize that I was closely related to the inner elements of the character . I get his age and experience and I know what your body feels like at 60 . I ve raised a daughter . My daughter is 27 now and has gone on to be the age where she could have children . And so the character was close to me in that way . That s where good acting starts from you have an inner story that s already there . The hard part is getting it out to open it up , to be truthful and reveal it . Acting is revealing the truth that is already within you and that reflects the character that you re doing . It s the process that I work from . That s why I was able to tap into that character right from the audition . And that s also , I m sure , what Dan , John , and Glenn saw and felt in the initial audition . The blessing is that we were able to capture it on film . Are there other things you had to do to find William after identifying his truth and realizing that you related to it ? You still have to do the homework . The homework is in the script . That s the study part , the mental part of it . Being able to master and own the script , memorize the lines , know the story , know what the writers are trying to say , and know what the layers are . And there was research in regards to looking up elements about Memphis , the music and poetry , finding the different poems that you think the character might like or listening to the music the character would like or play . Once you do all that and you do it on a daily basis , it seeps into the subconscious . That s where you work from . Then you open up and let it happen . I try to get a script as soon as possible to delve into it to see where the arc is going . Were you a fan of egg creams before , or was that part of the homework process ? I was . I had an uncle who used to take me to Brooklyn for egg creams when I was a kid [ Laughs ] . So I did know about those already . It was a funny coincidence when they did that . Also , I think they knew coming in that I was a jazz aficionado . We talked about that in the room . Several of the writers , Dan and myself , and a few of the other actors , Sterling and Susan [ Kelechi Watson ] , are fans , so we explored some ideas about how the jazz element could come into it . William has a particular sound to his voice and tonality to his language . It was sort of a rhythm or a mood , if you will , and I loved doing that too . I loved exploring the language , getting the words in your mouth , and moving them around and adding tonality and melody . It s something I learned from doing August Wilson onstage . Some of the monologues Dan wrote , I could interpret in a very musical way . That s where the enjoyment of [ being ] an actor is playing with all the elements that you discover . You do n t know all the answers , and they start to come in the process . And that s about trust . You learn that you can trust that it will happen . It will be there when you need it . Music also plays a giant part in The Get Down , and that is a time period you would have been closer to . Did the process feel similar when developing that character ? Yes and no . Ironically , one of the writers on the show is my best friend . When he ended up getting the gig and started to write this character , we talked about it a lot and I read for it . That s how I booked that role . It started formulating when talking to him and listening to him talk about the project and all of our experiences growing up in the â€˜ 70s and with hip-hop when New York was almost bankrupt . Out of it came this new art form . You could actually see it . It was so tangible at the time during the years of the blackout and Son of Sam . All that history s in that show . From there came the character , Winston , who was a beautiful character and ironically another black man who can project love , which you do n t see a lot . He is a father of three boys who had a loving relationship with his wife and who is struggling to keep his boys out of trouble and still be himself . It was this open , artistic , beautiful character that they laid out for me there in The Get Down . Having those few episodes to try to get that in was a joy . It was a joy to work on that project and with Baz Luhrmann . To be able to talk with him and see and hear all his visions for the project was so rewarding . You knew it was going to have a beautiful aesthetic , and so I m very proud of it . It often seems that people think character actors are less important than leads . But lately , I d argue those parts are usually more fun , complicated , or interesting . Would you agree ? I do n t know . We see it a little differently . I think most actors do n t start out wanting to be either a lead or a character actor . You just really want to work , whatever manifestation that takes . It makes me think of that old expression , There are no small parts , just small actors . It reads true as far as I m concerned . There s a fine line between lead actor and supporting actor . Two actors do their job to get a story across . Someone else then takes it and turns it into a category , which turns into an award , which turns into more work . I do n t have control over that . I just do the role to the best of my ability , and I ll leave it up to you , the media , to call it what you will . You just hope to do a good character . Good character actors are lead actors , and lead actors can be good character actors . It really depends on the script and the story . If you look at old movies , you have lead actors who also played supporting roles . You have James Cagney or Bogart in the same film as Edward G. Robinson . Or you have George Clooney pulling together the Ocean s 11 thing with all different character and lead actors . So the case of This Is Us , it felt more like an ensemble all along . It felt very much like theater . It s all connected . Whether it s the lead or a supporting role , you re trying to move people with your performance . No matter how you categorize William , what you ve accomplished with him is amazing . He became one of the most interesting and beloved characters on the show despite not being one of the Pearsons . That means so much because you do n t often hear those things . That s a beautiful thing to hear . For me , that s the payoff . That s the award when you have people really feeling the work . Wow , it s like finally someone is actually talking about the work not just the way his body looked , or if he s good-looking , or how many stunts he s done . I love hearing it . I appreciate it . It humbles me . I lost my father last year and took on covering the show before I really knew it involved two dads potentially dying . It was really hard to watch at first because it is so realistic to the experience many people have gone through . But it was also very healing . I felt the same way . I have lost several important people from my life . One of my best friends is actually going through that process right now with stage IV stomach cancer . And it can be painful to think of those things . My daughter could n t watch that episode . I do n t know if she s ever watched it in its totality because it affects her in a way . I m getting older and not running around the way we used to run around . A lot of feelings come up there , too . We ve had to sit down and have a talk about it . I , too , was very moved by it . It was hard to do that death scene [ in the hospital ] . It was n t easy . Emotionally , it was very , very difficult to get that scene across so I m glad they did it the way that they did , that we did n t have to stretch it out for a long time in multiple episodes . We got to the initial , difficult stuff right from the beginning . It made the day a lot easier to get through because that was a very difficult scene for me . It kicked up a lot of my own stuff in my personal life , too . I had to be able to trust that Sterling and the people around us would treat me with gloved hands and share the experience with me . That s what the result on the camera is , which I m very proud of . Were you personally ready for William s death ? No , just like everyone else who watches , I was not . I was worried that meant it was it for me on the show , and I was sad I might lose a role I was so attached to . It was also painful to think that he was not going to exist as the man he had become from knowing Randall and his family . But I also trust Dan and the writers , so I have to believe they made the right move for the show . Can you calm the nerves of fans who are worried that Season 2 of This Is Us will be William-less ? I do n t know much about what will happen in Season 2 yet . We have not been told much . But I can give a confirmation that you will see the character in some form or fashion . I do n t know how many episodes , although I imagine it will be quite a few , or at what age we will see William . In terms of which storylines they plan to approach , your guess is as good as mine at this point . Must be interesting to be doing that at almost the same time as Luke Cage , which comparatively is a more fun , action-driven superhero show . Every moment s different and special in its own way . I think the work happens all the same way , but sometimes it s fun to do something lighter [ where ] you can have more fun and there s a little more laughing going on . I love it all . I would love to do some comedy sometime and bring out my comedic chops . You want to try to do it all . Each project came with its own set of problems and attitudes . But I like the diversity . I m fortunate enough to have been able to do that with the stream [ of work ] that happened that year . I was booking things one after another [ Laughs ] , which never happened to me before . I ll take it . What s the craziest/most interesting thing you ve ever done to get into a character ? That s not hard to answer . About three summers ago , I did a production of the play Prometheus Bound , about this guy chained to a rock for eternity by Zeus . I did it in conjunction with the California Institute of the Arts . I had been teaching some classes there through good friends , Travis Preston and Marissa Chibas , who run the dramatic wing of that institution . We did it at the Getty Villa out on the Pacific Coast Highway outside in the amphitheater . The director mounted it with a 24-foot steel wheel with an inner circling wheel attached to it built by this rigging company that does a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows and other big budget stuff . I had to do the whole play and the whole play is just him speaking on the top of that wheel in a crucifix position . That probably was one of the most challenging experiences and the most gut-wrenching study experiences that I ve had to do . The old language is very poetic , in Greek form . My brain was exhausted doing all the study behind it trying to find the character in there . It was crazy , man . And then I found out we were going to be outside and on that wheel and it was very physically demanding . The whole play takes place outside under the sky , and many of the references are to Zeus and the elements . It became a lot about water and wind and fire and storm and sky and stars . And so I was closer to the sky and water and stars and wind in doing it this way , so it brought me closer to the language and closer to the character . Eventually , it was one of the most beautiful productions I have ever seen or been involved in . This Is Us will return this fall on NBC . Season 1 of Luke Cage and The Get Down are now streaming on Netflix .",

If the 20-year-old Stan Lee were here today , would he still be writing comic books?I love to write , so I would be writing for any medium that would have me . But certainly , television and movies are the two big things today . I like to write short things because I 'm impatient , so I 'd probably write a television show or try to write one before a movie . A movie would take a little bit longer . But it would have to be one of the two . Have movies and TV replaced comic books , or are comic books still doing what they used to , entertainment-wise ? Comic books are still doing what they used to do , but what 's happened is they 've become a wellspring now for movies and for television . For toys , for licensing , for merchandising . You get a good comic book that people like , and it can go anywhere : It can turn out to be a motion picture series , a television series it could be anything . But , see , another thing , if you show a producer a comic book , he can look at it in a few minutes and visualize whether it would make a good movie . It 's a lot easier that having to sit down and read a whole movie script .

It probably would 've looked very much like this because they do n't have too many special effects â€¦ yet . So they would have been able to do it . The thing that makes this year and this time period different than the '60s is the special effects that we 're able to get in television and movies . For example , \" Spider-Man \" could never been made 30 years ago . Or if it had been made , it would n't have been as effective as now . The same with Thor and all of them . But today , with the special-effects ability that we have , we can show anything , anything you can imagine . And we can make it look believable and exciting . Did you have advice for anybody on-set at \" Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \" ? Oh hell , I 'm nobody to give advice ! I 'm just glad that they have me there , and I hope that I wo n't do anything wrong . I 'm not gon na give advice to those guys who are pros . Let 's face it , I 'm just a guy who wrote comic books . No , you 're the guy who wrote comic books.All right , I like the way you say that !

There are currently plans for film versions of both characters , but both have long and tortured histories . Wesley Snipes wanted to make a Black Panther film as far back as 1992 , but script concerns and then bankruptcy woes postponed production .

		"paragraph": "While Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed go head-to-head in the new Venom , in terms of hip-hop , they re on the same page . At least when it comes to Eminem . Just over a month ago , the rapper surprise-released a new album , Kamikaze , which closes with the blistering track Venom , written specifically for the movie , which is in theaters this week . He s one of the greatest of all time , Ahmed , who plays the villainous Dr. Carlton Drake , said in an interview with Yahoo Entertainment . Hardy , who pulls double duty as journalist Eddie Brock and symbiote monster Venom , chimed in , dubbing Eminem the GOAT . I m a huge Eminem fan , Hardy said . While Hardy has seemingly left his skills as an MC in the past ( a mixtape emerged earlier this year ) , Ahmed still raps in the hip-hop duo Swet Shop Boys under the name Riz MC . Ahmed went on to call the Detroit rapper an artist who s really influenced me and remembered exactly where he was when Eminem first blew his mind . It was on a late night music video show on TV , and it was â€˜ Hi , my name is , said Ahmed . I remember I just went , â€˜ I do n t know what this is , but I went straight for a VHS tape and just put it in and recorded as much of it as I could , and I just watched that back again and again . Eminem s brazen , no-holds-barred music was both jarring and addicting for Ahmed . I could n t believe that someone was saying those things , Ahmed said . His voice , his attitude , it was so accessible but also so subversive , just the playfulness and the wordplay , the athleticism , the intelligence , the humor it was all there . It was like crack to a little preteen . Hardy added that for him , hearing Eminem was an awakening moment . The experience was palpable , he said . He stands out specifically as an enigma he s unique . While Eminem leaves the biggest imprint on the music in Venom , Ahmed joked that two other hip-hop legends influenced his character . For Dr. Carlton Drake , he said , It was Dr. Dre and Drake . He s West Coast and East Coast , best of both . [ He brings ] everyone on board , makes you dance . What kind of dance , you ask ?

In an interview with Refinery 29 , Bey 's longtime makeup artist , Sir John , shared some of the secrets behind her Coachella makeup , which featured glittery lids and a warm nude lip . According to the interview , Sir John revealed that the beauty look was inspired by an '80s movie called School Days , and he wanted to make the artist look like \" a college girl on campus . \" For Bey 's eyes , he mixed iridescent purple and terracotta-colored glitters , which he applied to the center of the lid .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This article contains spoilers for the third episode of Daredevil Season 2 . If you re looking for the precise moment where Netflix s hit series Daredevil threw down and demonstrated that it was n t going to be like any other superhero show , jump straight to the last scene of the second episode . There , you ll be greeted by an epic three-minute , one-take hallway battle where the titular hero ( Charlie Cox ) takes on a squadron of goons despite being pretty battered and beaten himself . Designed by the show s fight coordinator , Philip Silvera , and his longtime collaborator , Roberto Gutierrez , the sequence is a marvel of action and camera choreography , equaling and even surpassing some of the set-pieces in some of Marvel s big-budget movies . Related : Ken Tucker Reviews â€˜ Daredevil Season 2 Heading into Season 2 , Silvera knew that fans would be expecting a battle royale to equal or surpass that hallway brawl . And in episode 3 , New York s Finest , they ll get it . Having been captured and lectured on the proper way to deal with criminals by the new vigilante on the black , the Punisher ( Jon Bernthal ) , Daredevil manages to free himself from his chains and knocks the gun-toting ex-soldier unconscious instead . But his will is further tested when he realizes there s a biker gang headed their way who definitely have murder on their minds . Dumping the Punisher s prone body in an elevator , the hero turns to face the oncoming rush of bad guys â€¦ in another hallway . Speaking with Yahoo TV , Silvera says he did n t intend to return to the scene of the previous season s standout fight sequence . Originally , I was hoping that we would n t repeat it , because it was unique to that episode s story , he says . But the Season 2 hallway fight should n t be mistaken for a mere repeat . For one thing , Daredevil literally has his hands full during the fight : one carries a gun that the Punisher duct-taped to his palm , while the other holds the chain that used to be wrapped around his chest . And the punching does n t stop when he reaches the end of the hallway : instead , he continues the fight down a stairwell the camera once again appearing to capture the action without any cuts and into a basement room bathed in red light where he faces a final batch of opponents . I wanted it to feel like we were starting somewhere familiar , like â€˜ Here we are in another hallway ! Silvera says , laughing . And then we go a different way with it . Clocking in at a super-sized eight minutes , the sequence further burnishes Daredevil s reputation as the new standard bearer for comic book action on TV . And according to Silvera , showrunners Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez came up with a compelling metaphor to underline all the bad-assery . They pitched me the idea that this particular fight is a descent into hell for Daredevil . He s been challenged by the Punisher to not cross the line [ between hero and villain ] , and you see him riding that line all the way down the stairs . There are times when you think he might cross it , because he gets pretty brutal . Silvera filled us in on the way this sure-to-be-talked-about sequence came together and how he found himself in the midst of the action as the cameraman . ( And by the way binge-watchers , he cites episodes 9 and 11 as his personal favorites . ) Last season s hallway battle was filmed in one take without any cuts this one seemed to have a few edits hidden in the action.It s definitely done differently . There might have been a little bit of whip pan [ tricks ] going on here and there , and some Texas Switches [ where a stunt double replaces the actor while the cameras are still rolling ] . So the purity of the last one and this one is different . We had to be able to do things technically with this fight in order to give it that feeling of going down the staircase . How long did it take to shoot?If I tell you how many days , it would give away the secret ! [ Laughs ] I can tell you it took three full days of prep this time around , whereas last time I had two-and-a-half days . Putting the gun and chain in Daredevil s hands changes the tenor of the fight he can do more damage this time.Oh yeah he s basically got a metal hammer in one hand and a set of brass knuckles on the other . Charlie and I talked about the way the gang members do n t know that the gun is empty , but the way he pushes it out puts a sense of fear into them . And then he pulls the trigger and it clicks ! It s just a different way of messing with them . I really love that moment . The other thing , too , is that he was more wounded when he got into the previous hallway battle . So there s a different energy to how he approaches this one . We do n t see him getting full-on tired the way he did before he s got a real anger and determination this time and he has to stay in the moment . Most fight sequences maintain a horizontal axis , so it s really invigorating to see one that unfolds vertically.It was a big undertaking . We had to make smart decisions , like Is the camera leading or the action leading and the camera is catching up ? The camera was mostly handheld , and there are certain sequences where we re lowering it or handing it off to another person as they re going down so we can stay constantly in motion . We were in a real building in Long Island City , so these were tight spaces . And we put some pads on the walls because some of the stunt guys are flying down the staircase , and falling on top of each other . Were there any blown takes where the cameraperson got clipped by a mistimed punch?I was the cameraman for the staircase sequence I was able to become a second unit director this season , and they entrusted me to shoot and direct some of these action sequences . And it s a danger to be that close to the action for the performers as well as the cameraman . It s such a confined space , so every move is very specific . As the cameraman , you have to step back a certain way , and you have to make sure the camera can see the action , but be out of their way at the same time . It s a very specific dance , and you ve got a very short amount of time to get that dance . There was moment at the bottom of the staircase , where I might have tripped over some of the guys legs and just kept going ! [ Laughs ] I had to stay in the moment with them . These guys are putting it all out there , and you do n t want one thing to go wrong and have to do it again . With one season under his belt , is Charlie Cox doing more of his own fighting this time around?Charlie has a great physical memory for things , and gets better and better . He works 24/7 as the lead of the show , so he gets very little time to rehearse with us , but you see him in there more and feel his emotions in the fight a lot more this season . He s one of the first people who gets the pre-visualizations of the fight sequences , and studies them and we rehearse with him on set . But his stunt double , Chris Brewster , and the other stunt guys worked for three days non-stop . Chris is under the gun as much as Charlie in some ways . He has to make sure he s up to par with Charlie s ability , and then gets beat up and beat around during these sequences and has to do another one the next day ! What discussions go into planning the fight choreography for a scene like this ? Are you thinking about which specific marital arts disciplines to highlight with every punch ? The discussions are more like , How can I strike if my hand is taped to a gun ? I ca n t grab you , so maybe I ll wrap the gun around your head . We try to find the practicality of what Daredevil can do . And we try to remember that he has [ heightened senses ] . In an early version of the staircase fight , we had a gang member fire a gun at him , and then he d evade the bullet and smack the gun out of his hand . But Charlie does a great job at keeping us honest , so he reminded us that he d be able to anticipate that guy coming and would swing at him earlier . So you work that sense of anticipation into his choreography . Were there discussions about ending the sequence after the stairway ? That final round in the red room is brutal , but it s a more traditional fight . No , there was always going to be one more trial . That represented his full descent into hell , and we would see him either become a devil or stay where he s at . Doug and Marco were smart with how they wrote it , and we just tried to match that idea as we best we could . It was definitely a relief to be on level ground again ! Should Netflix order a third season , are you worried with how you re going to top yourself next time around ? I do n t really worry too much about trying to top myself . I just want to match the story the writers are telling , and within those stories , find something unique to do with the action . If I just worry about doing something different , I do n t know if they ll relate to the story and that s what sets these sequences apart they let us tell the story of these characters [ through action ] , which is great . Season 2 of Daredevil is currently streaming on Netflix",

The Patriots corner is one of the softest-spoken players in the locker room at Gillette Stadium , but that does n't mean he 's not opinionated .

I asked him this week about Jaguars corner Jalen Ramsey and Ramsey 's comments about Chiefs playmaker Tyreek Hill being more of a \" return specialist \" than a receiver .

		"paragraph": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have dated for nearly a decade now after meeting on , appropriately enough , the set of a Nicholas Sparks movie , The Last Song . No matter what people are saying about them , they re still in love . Hemsworth confirmed it Tuesday with a rare photo of the couple that he shared on Instagram , just as rumors that the two had split surfaced â€¦ again . Cyrus and Hemsworth have regularly battled such stories , in part because they re celebrities and everything they do is overanalyzed , but also because in the early years of their relationship , even his friends categorized them as on-off . ( To be fair , they were teenagers when they got together . ) Here s a quick recap of their relationship status over the years , both in real life and according to tabloid reports : According to E! , Cyrus s work schedule caused them to call off their romance . Surprisingly , this is when sources described as Hemsworth s friends said it was n t the first time he and Cyrus had ended things . In November , a Cyrus friend confirmed breakup reports to E! : They are , and have been , taking a break , the source said . It s just a time-out . He s in Australia and she is on her European tour . People lost their minds when Cyrus hit the red carpet with a sparkler that seemingly no one had noticed before . The chatter was so loud that Cyrus felt compelled to address it on Twitter , where she seemed to take offense at the idea that the ring in question would ever be her engagement ring . It s topaz , people ! During the first week of June , Cyrus revealed that she had accepted a proposal from Hemsworth on May 31 . ( The ring was a 3.5-carat diamond , not a topaz . ) The buzz that Cyrus and Hemsworth had decided to call the whole thing off grew so strong that she refuted it on social media . Rumors that she had cheated on him with former Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick , and the fact that they had attended separate parties on the night of the Oscars , were the culprits . Shortly after , Cyrus stepped out without her engagement ring , which went over really well , as you can imagine . She assured fans that a wedding was still in her future . Miley s Achy Breaky Heart father , Billy Ray Cyrus , did n t help matters in April when he said on Nightline , They re young , they re kids . The great news is they re great friends . They re really , really good friends . If you end up getting married , that s your business . Uh-oh . After Cyrus unfollowed Hemsworth on Twitter , her rep confirmed that they were dunzo , once again . Cyrus and Hemsworth were outed as friends , at the very least , when an animal shelter gave them a shoutout in the same post thanking them for adopting a dog . Aha ! There was more over the next few months . Cyrus was spotted hanging out with Elsa Pataky , who s married to Hemsworth s brother Chris . The Wrecking Ball singer was also photographed wearing her engagement ring again and unloading a moving truck at Hemsworth s pad . Finally , almost a year later , Miley confirmed that she and her man were once again a couple . And they were engaged ! The breakup rumors began again almost immediately and have continued to this day of course , in between breathless reports about Jennifer Aniston s 204th pregnancy .

		"paragraph": "COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) Several ex-wrestlers at Ohio State University on Tuesday countered allegations that U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan turned a blind eye to alleged abuse of athletes by a former university team doctor decades ago . Some ex-wrestlers from the late 1980s and early 1990s have said in recent weeks they were inappropriately groped by doctor Richard Strauss during medical exams , and that Strauss participated in odd behavior such as showering with athletes from different teams several times a day . Some of the accusers have said Jordan knew about the alleged abuse when he worked as an assistant coach from 1987 to 1995 . Jordan , founder of the conservative Freedom Caucus and potential contender for House speaker , denies that and has said he and other coaches would have reported any alleged abuse brought to their attention . Independent investigators commissioned by the university are reviewing allegations against Strauss by men from 14 sports and are also looking into his work for student health services and at his off-campus medical clinic . Ohio State has said more than 150 former athletes and witnesses have been interviewed so far , and the school has urged anyone with information to contact the investigators from the Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie . Statements from 14 individuals released by a Virginia public relations firm Tuesday include comments from wrestlers who say they knew nothing of the allegations against Strauss , and those who acknowledge possible issues with the doctor at the focus of an investigation . All back Jordan 's assertion he knew nothing of the alleged abuse when he was an assistant coach . Strauss \" conducted his transgressions behind closed doors and regretfully , I never told anyone except for my father . Jim Jordan is an honorable man that does not deserve this unwarranted attention , \" Matt Mondalek , who wrestled at the school from 1995 to 1999 , said in a statement released by PR firm Shirley and Banister . Andy Stickley , a wrestler from 1983 to 1987 , said he never heard a teammate say they 'd been abused by Strauss . \" Not only was Jim a great wrestling coach , but he has also consistently proven to be a man of highest integrity and certainly would not have turned his back on any wrong-doing , \" Stickley said in his statement . One of the 14 , Jim Picolo , who wrestled at Ohio State from 1982-87 , told The Associated Press Tuesday he never heard about any abuse by Strauss . However , he did think the doctor was a bit odd . \" The only thing I remember is him showering a lot with different teams , \" Picolo said . He and Jordan trained together when both were in high school , and Jordan later became an assistant coach at Ohio State during Picolo 's senior year . He came to consider Jordan and head coach Russ Hellickson as friends . \" They fought for us in a lot of different ways on many occasions , \" Picolo said . \" If anyone had acted in that manner toward us , they would have taken action . \" On Monday , six former Ohio State wrestling coaches defended Jordan in a joint statement that said none of them was aware of abuse of wrestlers . Also Monday , a watchdog group and a former special counsel to President Barack Obama sought an ethics review of Jordan . The request to the Office of Congressional Ethics said questions of dishonesty can bring discredit to the House in violation of House rules . Strauss died in 2005 , and it was ruled a suicide . His family was shocked to learn of the allegations from news reports and is cooperating with the school 's independent investigation , according to a family statement over the weekend .

		"paragraph": "Tucker Carlson has a new show on Fox News called Tucker Carlson Tonight . It takes the place of Greta Van Susteren s show , and thus serves as a lead-in to The O Reilly Factor . Carlson s new hour could be seen in part as a deserved reward for enduring his previous Fox assignment : sitting on a sofa with two people not operating on the same level as he does , as co-host of the weekend edition of Fox and Friends . There were some Saturdays at 6 a.m. when Carlson announced an upcoming segment featuring , say , new barbecue equipment , or a hot-yoga demonstration , and you could almost see his soul shuddering a little . Tucker Carlson Tonight makes better use of his talents . But what exactly are those talents ? Carlson s TV persona is that of the Smartest WASP in the Room , the plu-perfect preppy . His rep tie and self-consciously mussed hair are the status symbols of the sort of jaunty yet pious fellows who are fixtures of summer homes up and down the Connecticut-to-Maine corridor . As such , Carlson is a deft debater , trained since posh boarding school in how to appear to win any argument not merely with logic and rhetorical vigor , but also his superior gaze . In all this , he s the exact opposite of a self-styled working-class brawler like Bill O Reilly , which actually makes them excellent time-period companions . Their styles could not be more different , yet they both relish steamrolling over anyone with the temerity to disagree with them . Twelve years ago , Jon Stewart went on a self-righteous rant on CNN s Crossfire when it was co-hosted by Carlson and Paul Begala , accusing their show of hurting America . ( Stewart was both prescient and full of himself time has not been kind to this tirade . ) Now Carlson has become a pure entertainer who makes no pretense of convincing you he truly believes half the stuff he says . He s there to rumble , alternating a frown of faux-earnestness with a grin of happy triumphalism . Tucker Carlson Tonight has been on the air only since mid-November , but it did n t take long to establish its tone and format . At the top of every show , Carlson proclaims that his hour is the sworn enemy of lying , pomposity , smugness , and group-think . It s certainly refreshing to turn on a prime-time Fox News show that does n t feature the usual array of Fox bobbleheads such as sonorous Charles Krauthammer or that scary Sheriff David Clarke . Instead , the first segment of each edition of Tonight is usually given over to a current news item , for which Carlson books a guest who might represent the side that Carlson takes issue with . These topics have ranged from a critique of the Trump electorate with the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , to a very small-beans story about the head of an Albuquerque Internet marketing firm who announced he did n t want to do business with Trump supporters . In both cases , Carlson smiled , thanked the guest for appearing on the show , and then proceeded to come down on him like a ton of bricks . Carlson said that Kristof s recent columns have characterized Trump supporters as Nazis and Ku Klux Klan supporters . Kristof pointed to the column Carlson held in his hand and said , No , I said precisely the opposite : that one can not stereotype Trump voters , but his protest fell on intentionally deaf ears . And so it went , with Carlson telling Kristof he has n t thought deeply about the suffering of your fellow Americans and Kristof citing one column after another in which he had Carlson throwing out more points he said Kristof had n t made , followed by Kristof quoting himself , refuting Carlson s charges . Good to be in the lion s den , Kristof said upon leaving , looking a little dazed . In the case of the Albuquerque CEO , Matthew Blanchfield , Carlson scoffed at his announcement that he did n t want to do business with Trump supporters . When Blanchfield defended himself , Carlson wrapped up the segment by saying , and Boy , you are on a moral vanity trip like I ve never seen , and I think we re veering into hysteria here . This is a common Carlson tactic when he ca n t refute a point or answer a question lobbed back at him by a guest , he starts blowing smoke , yelping to Wesleyan University president Michael Roth ( with whom Carlson debated so-called sanctuary campuses ) , I m totally losing track of your position ! when Roth had made his position perfectly clear . In Roth , Carlson was dealing with a social equal , and as a consequence met with someone he could not buffalo as easily as most of the people with whom he stacks his show . Which is not to say that Carlson does n t sometimes pick overinflated gasbags who deserve to be punctured with an accurately thrown dart . When Carlson brought on activist author Tariq Nasheed to explain a tweet Nasheed had posted that clearly implied racism on the part of a white police officer , Nasheed failed utterly to back up his claim , instead huffing and puffing about false narratives and Carlson s suspected white-supremacist views . The whole thing was tensely amusing , but come on Nasheed is the author of advice books for women including The Mack Within and The Art of Gold Digging in plucking Nasheed s dumb tweet from the entire Twittersphere , I think Carlson s bookers knew this was shooting one very small fish in a barrel . There s no denying the entertainment quotient of Tucker Carlson Tonight for the moment , it s novel to see an articulate fellow run verbal rings around some of his sillier guests . But once people get wise to Carlson s sandbag-the-guest bit , I wonder how many media bigwigs like Kristof will be willing to get punched around . The show may soon be reduced to beating up on guys who ve posted Occupy Wall Street 4 Ever photos on Instagram . Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 7 p.m. on Fox News .",

		"paragraph": "ELKO , Nev/MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - President Donald Trump said Washington will exit the Cold-War era treaty that eliminated a class of nuclear weapons due to Russian violations , triggering a warning of retaliatory measures from Moscow . The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 , required elimination of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries . \" Russia has not , unfortunately , honored the agreement so we 're going to terminate the agreement and we 're going to pull out , \" Trump told reporters on Saturday after a rally in Nevada . Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Sunday that a unilateral U.S. withdrawal would be \" very dangerous \" and lead to a \" military-technical \" retaliation . U.S. authorities believe Moscow is developing and has deployed a ground-launched system in breach of the INF treaty that could allow it to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice . Russia has consistently denied any such violation . Trump said the United States will develop the weapons unless Russia and China agree to a halt on development . China is not a party to the treaty and has invested heavily in conventional missiles , while the INF has banned U.S possession of ground - launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles of ranges between 500 and 5,500 km ( 311 and 3,418 miles ) . Trump 's national security adviser , John Bolton , will visit Moscow next week . Ryabkov , in comments reported by state-controlled RIA news agency , said if the United States withdrew , Russia would have no choice but to retaliate , including taking unspecified measures of a \" military-technical nature \" . \" But we would rather things did not get that far , \" RIA quoted him as saying . TASS news agency quoted him as saying withdrawal \" would be a very dangerous step \" , and it was Washington and not Moscow that was failing to comply with the treaty . He said the Trump administration was using the treaty in an attempt to blackmail the Kremlin , putting global security at risk . \" ... We will , of course , accept no ultimatums or blackmail methods , \" Interfax quoted him as saying . British defense minister Gavin Williamson , in comments reported by the Financial Times , said London stood \" resolute \" behind Washington over the issue , and that the Kremlin was making a mockery of the agreement .

		"paragraph": "Meet 23-year-old South Sudanese fashion model Thon Peter Athian ( aka Nile Shadow ) , who lives in Moscow . Yahoo Lifestyle first spotted him during Artem Shumov s runway show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Russia . Out of more than 50 runway shows during the week , Athian was just one of only a handful of black models who were cast . This is his story on working as a model of color in the Russian fashion industry . Athian is originally from South Sudan , where his family still lives . He had moved to Moscow to earn his degree studying petroleum engineering at the Russian State Geological Prospecting University . His focus on education is still a priority . He never planned on becoming a model , but one fateful event two years ago changed it all . Athian participated in a small indie shoot where he got connected to the modeling agency Look Models Russia . Soon afterward , he was signed . Since then , Athian has not booked any jobs outside of Moscow , but he has been able to do a few small-scale shoots in addition to select catwalk appearances for emerging designers like Artem Shumov . Shumov is a designer with whom Athian has worked since the beginning of his career and someone he considers to be seriously embracing diversity . When asked what was it about Athian that struck him , the designer tells Yahoo Lifestyle that it was never about the color of Athian s skin it was about his beauty both inside and out : He s incredibly beautiful his face , his smile . He has such good vibes . But in the grand scheme of things , Shumov is the exception . How do other designers treat Athian ? Though I have n t yet experienced any sort of racism , it has always been hard getting selected in castings , especially by the local designers with exceptions of very few , he says . He adds candidly , The truth is that there s not much diversity in the fashion industry here . Sometimes I do n t even waste my time going to castings because I am always certain they wo n t take me . Unfortunately , he does n t expect to see a change in this perception soon , as ultimately , Russians like seeing things that look like them . Despite this outlook , Athian says he will continue to model for now , as it helps fund a portion of his tuition . I am not sure if I can have reliable pay from modeling in [ the ] future , so I prefer engineering , he says . I do n t make enough money here . Besides , my parents know that I am here for [ my ] studies . While modeling is prestigious work in places like New York or Paris , do n t expect a black model to make enough here in Russia , he says . If God [ will ] help me to finish my engineering [ degree ] successfully , that will be enough for me .

He 's shown this time and time again , when he cried as he was thinking about his daughter Malia approaching college , when he got tearful about her graduation , and when he admitted saying goodbye to her when started as a freshman at Harvard this past September was \" like open-heart surgery . \" There 's something extremely relatable in his tearing up , as many parents feel like time is flying as they watch their kids grow up . In an interview with David Letterman on the host 's new Netflix show My First Guest Needs No Introduction , taped in 2017 and released today , the former president revealed new details about the memorable day when he , Michelle , and Sasha helped 19-year-old Malia move into her Harvard dorm .

		"paragraph": "By Samuel Shen and Vidya Ranganathan SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Six months of wrangling over trade tariffs with the United States has wiped out about a fifth of China 's stock market value and driven its currency down sharply . But those moves may have just been a downpayment on what is yet to come . Shanghai 's benchmark share index is down roughly 22 percent since January , when U.S. President Donald Trump 's first trade tariffs on solar panels were announced . It has fallen 9 percent since June 19 , when Trump outlined his plans to tax a lot more Chinese imports than he initially proposed . Tariffs on the first batch of $ 34 billion worth of Chinese imports kicked in on Friday . Beijing said it had no choice but to respond in kind by taxing a similar amount of U.S. goods coming into China . U.S. tariffs on another $ 16 billion of Chinese goods are due to go into effect in two weeks , Trump said on Thursday . But Trump also raised the temperature much further by telling reporters that after the initial $ 50 billion of goods has been targeted with tariffs , Washington could add another $ 500 billion . With Beijing indicating it will respond with tariffs on more U.S. imports or other corresponding actions of its own , the spectre of a full-blown trade war risks sinking China 's markets deeper into bear territory . Initial market estimates of the impact of tit-for-tat Chinese and U.S. tariffs have been modest . A China central bank adviser , Ma Jun , said U.S. tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of Chinese goods will shave 0.2 percentage points off Chinese growth . Market economists reckoned that every $ 100 billion of imports affected by tariffs would take away around 0.5 percent of global trade . And they have assumed a direct impact on China 's economic growth in 2018 of 0.1-0.3 percentage points , and a somewhat lower effect on U.S. growth . But the massive scale of Trump 's suggested new U.S. tariffs - 10 times the initial $ 50 billion - would blow any such modest predictions out of the water . \" The bigger the size ( of imports facing tariffs ) , the bigger the potential that the GDP impact is larger than a linear extrapolation would suggest , \" said Aidan Yao , senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong . There were other secondary effects on confidence , investment and global supply chains to be considered , besides the impact on the economy through financial markets , wealth effects and corporate funding , he said . \" The risk is we underestimate the impact based on these simple back-of-the-envelope calculations . \" BOTTOMLESS Given the uncertainty over the trade dispute , securities analysts in China suggest investors should just sell shares and hold onto cash . \" The bottom for A-shares is nowhere in sight , \" said Samuel Chien , partner of Shanghai BoomTrend Investment Management Co . \" Whether you look at fundamental factors , or market psychology , there 's nothing bright - a Sino-U.S. trade war will have a seriously negative impact on China 's economy , \" Chien said . He said he fears the Shanghai index , now trading at 2,747 points , could shed another quarter of its value to get as low as 2,000 in the next 6 to 12 months . The yuan currency has stabilised around 6.65 per dollar this week after Chinese state banks intervened to defend it at 11-month lows . It has dropped nearly 7 percent since April . While U.S. stock markets have been more stable than China 's during these past months of escalating trade tensions , analysts warn against discounting Beijing 's capacity to retaliate . China has taken a softer , conciliatory approach so far , but investors only need to hark back to last year when South Korean companies bore the brunt of a backlash from China over Seoul 's deployment of a U.S. missile system . The companies lost billions of dollars in market value after a Chinese boycott of Korean goods , group tours to South Korea , and the targeting of one conglomerate in particular , Lotte Group , for various regulatory inspections at its stores in China . Lotte had swapped some land with the South Korean government to enable the missile system 's deployment . The analysts say that Beijing could suddenly make it very difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China , whether it be getting contracts , licenses or regulatory approvals . If patriotic Chinese consumers were also unleashed , damaging boycotts of American goods could follow . Perhaps the most threatening thing Beijing could do would be to unload some of its massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries - it is currently the biggest foreign owner . \" China s big stick is the bond market , \" said Stephen Innes , head of APAC trading at OANDA in Singapore . He said that Beijing would use that strategy \" if it is necessary . \" Such action would likely send Treasury yields significantly higher and raise U.S. government borrowing costs . It would also hurt China 's remaining holdings of the securities , which is one reason it would probably only be used as a last resort . BEAR TERRITORY In the meantime , technical indicators , from margin lending for shares to the prices of stock index futures , already point to a deeper slump in China 's stock markets . The SSE50 Index which tracks blue-chip shares hit a 13-month low on Thursday and has slumped roughly 12 percent in the past two weeks . In a sign market bulls are throwing in the towel , the outstanding value of margin financing - the money investors borrow to buy shares - has rapidly shrunk . Roughly 70 billion yuan ( $ 10.55 billion ) worth of leveraged bets were unwound over the past month alone , representing 7 percent of the total bets . On the other hand , the outstanding value of shares investors have borrowed to sell has jumped 45 percent this year to 6.5 billion yuan , despite several restrictions placed on such direct short-selling . Foreign investors are turning bearish on China stocks , too . Nearly uninterrupted foreign inflows into Chinese stocks this year , spurred by optimism around MSCI Inc 's inclusion of A-shares in its indexes on June 1 , have reversed course since mid-June . \" Even if the market is technically oversold , sentiment is low and valuations are lower , it is still too early to catch falling knives , as there will be further selling for structural liquidity reasons from anywhere , \" said Hong Hao , head of research at BOCOM International . \" At times like these , technical rebounds will be fleeting . \" ( $ 1 = 6.6359 Chinese yuan renminbi ) ( Additional reporting by Marius Zaharia in HONG KONG , Daniel Leussink in TOKYO Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Martin Howell )",

		"paragraph": "Walmart Inc. is exploring a subscription video-streaming service that would seek to challenge Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. by offering programming that targets Middle America , according to people familiar with the plans . Planning is still in the early stages and Walmart has n t given the project a green light , the people said . But a decision to move forward could come by late summer or early fall , according to one of these people . The retail giant would be late to the subscription video-streaming business , an increasingly crowded market that also includes Hulu and AT&T Inc. s HBO . Walmart is working with veteran television executive Mark Greenberg on the potential service , which could include a lower-price monthly subscription than those offered by Amazon and Netflix , according to people familiar with the plans . Walmart is considering programs that target consumers who live outside of large cities , said two of these people . Mr. Greenberg , who last year left his role as chief executive of Epix , a pay-television channel , has been advising Walmart for several months as it considers launching its own direct-to-consumer streaming service , the people said . He also held senior positions at pay channels Showtime and HBO . If it proceeds , the subscription-based media venture would be separate from Vudu , the online movie-streaming service Walmart bought in 2010 , the people said . Vudu , which allows users to buy or rent individual films , is widely available on televisions and streaming devices such as Roku , but has n t attracted the usership of rivals . Among U.S. households that streamed video on a television at home in April , 73 % watched Netflix , 50 % YouTube , 36 % Hulu , 28 % Amazon Prime Video and 13 % Vudu , according to comScore Inc . News of Walmart s potential programming strategy was earlier reported by The Information , a technology-news website . Walmart could license existing content rather than produce original programming , though establishing its own brand of original content could be important to the success of a Walmart streaming service , as it has been for Netflix and others , because acquired shows can be readily available elsewhere . Producing original content would be a costly venture . The aggressiveness of Netflix has driven up prices for talent for everyone . This year , Netflix has indicated it is spending $ 8 billion on original and acquired content . Amazon s programming budget is north of $ 4 billion , while HBO will spend $ 2.7 billion this year . Programming , two people close to the project said , could be middle of the road and aimed at Walmart s core shoppers away from the coasts . The ratings success of the brief return of Roseanne on Walt Disney Co. s ABC last spring indicated that there is a large audience not being served by most programmers .

The legislation was pushed through in April by the former , scandal-tainted regime in the run-up to a hotly contested general election , sparking a storm of anger . Political opponents said the law was a crude tool aimed at silencing criticism of the then government and its leader Najib Razak , particularly over the corruption mega-scandal surrounding sovereign wealth fund 1MDB . As well as hefty jail terms , the legislation punished the dissemination of what authorities deemed fake news with a fine of up to 500,000 ringgit ( $ 120,000 ) . However , Najib and his long-ruling coalition unexpectedly lost power at the landmark elections in May , bringing to power a reformist alliance which had campaigned on a pledge to abolish the law . Making good on that promise , lawmakers voted in favour of repealing the fake news law on Thursday after a three-hour debate . Charles Santiago , an MP from the ruling Pact of Hope coalition , told AFP the move was part of the new government 's \" commitment to take away all legislation that impinges on human rights and freedom of expression \" . Teddy Baguilat , a member of a Southeast Asian grouping of MPs who fight for better human rights , praised the move as \" a huge step forward . \" This is a law that was clearly designed to silence criticism of the authorities and to quell public debate -- it should never have been allowed to pass in the first place . \" Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , who ousted Najib at the polls , was investigated for allegedly spreading fake news days ahead of the election . He was an opposition leader at the time . Malaysia is one of several countries in Asia that have turned to such legislation , emboldened by US President Donald Trump 's fulminations against \" fake news \" , but activists warn authoritarian regimes will use the laws to target opponents .",

		"paragraph": "The Toyota Camry recently received its biggest redesign in years , boasting fully updated underpinnings and aggressive new styling . The 2018 model is quieter , more comfortable , better to drive and more pleasant to be in than any Camry before . But after spending a week evaluating it , I 'm not convinced that the 2018 Camry has what it takes to woo buyers who are increasingly purchasing crossovers and SUVs instead of sedans . Let 's start with what Toyota nails : the fundamentals . Space inside dwarves the Toyota Avalon , while ride quality and composure benefit from a switch to Toyota 's New Global Architecture ( TNGA ) , a vastly improved platform that the Camry shares with cars like the Prius , the new Corolla and the upcoming Rav4 . On a 355-mile jaunt from Columbus to Chicago , the Camry was able to accommodate four adults with baggage for a four-day trip . While Camrys of the past tended to float down the road , today 's model is more composed and European in style . It 's still very comfortable . The interior is upgraded and trades the jumbled-together look of older models for a more flowing and modern dash . Touch points are soft-touch plastic or leather for the most part , with tasteful brightwork and light leather helping it avoid the cave-like darkness of so many modern interiors . Our XLE tester was priced at $ 34,783 , which is reasonable for what it comes with . The standardization of Toyota Safety Sense which bundles active cruise control , automatic high beams , lane keeping and collision avoidance is something Toyota deserves repeated praise for . I especially appreciated the full-speed active cruise when stuck in Chicago toll traffic . Toyota improved its Etune entertainment system , too . Menus are mostly brightened and modernized , while overall performance felt less clumsy . It 's still not nearing best in class , but it 's less annoying to use than older versions . The Camry is comfortable , quiet , refined , bright , airy , efficient and stuffed with content . This is the family sedan , completed . People are n't buying sedans like they used to . The perennial-favorite family midsize sedan is quickly falling out of favor , with compact crossovers like the Rav4 and CR-V aggressively swallowing sales . To compete with crossovers that offer more capability for not much more , cars have to find a way to be more appealing than their lifted counterparts . And that 's the biggest weakness of the Camry . If you want a boring , mundane vehicle to get the job done , you 're likely going to be looking at one of the dozen white-bread crossovers . Sedans , as I see it , have two main advantages over crossovers : they sometimes look better and can drive better . Up against the mountaineering excess of a Jeep ad , you can counter-sell with performance or sexiness . But the Camry offers neither . Despite Toyota 's aggressive marketing and adventurous styling , the Camry does n't evoke emotion . It 's an extremely competent and capable car , but people buy with their guts . It looks good , but not great . It drives better than any Camry before it , but worse than a Mazda or a Honda . It 's refined but it is n't exciting . And in a world that does n't seem to care about sedans , that 's damnation enough . Start with a $ 25,350 Camry SE for your best blend of options and price . That locks you into the four-cylinder powertrain rather than the more potent V6 , but the base engine is adequately motivated and you are n't getting a performance car anyway . You 'll also want the \" Audio Package with Options , \" which tacks $ 3,380 on to the price . It includes a moonroof , passive entry , dual-zone climate control , upgraded infotainment with navigation , wireless charging , blind-spot monitoring , rear cross-traffic alert and a JBL stereo system . All in , you 're looking at $ 28,730 for a well-equipped sedan . I recommend the 2018 Camry . Though it is n't particularly exciting , it puts no foot wrong on its path toward becoming the near-ideal midsize sedan . It 's fantastic for road trips and even better for commuting . It does n't annoy or get in the way , so in that Toyota has accomplished its mission . I just worry that , with consumers increasingly opting for more \" lifestyle vehicles , \" Toyota getting everything right might not be enough to court buyers . Rating : Exterior : 3 Interior : 4 Driving Experience : 3.5 Value : 4.5 Overall : 4 Price as configured : $ 34,783",

		"paragraph": "The stock market should be peppy this year , as sharp cuts in the corporate tax rate goose profits . Instead , it ca n t seem to shake the gloomy feeling that something bad is about to happen . That s probably because President Trump is now putting into practice the protectionism he promised as a presidential candidate . In the two days following Trump s announcement of new 25 % tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of Chinese imports to the United States , the S&P 500 stock index fell nearly 5 % . The weekly decline of 6 % was the worst since January 2016 . Since markets anticipate future activity , this seems to be a portent of trouble looming and there s good reason to think it is . The same day Trump announced his new China tariffs , China announced retaliatory measures involving tariffs on just $ 3 billion of US imports to China . That relieved markets at first , as stocks stabilized . But those Chinese tariffs were n t in response to Trump s latest targeting of China . They were in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs Trump announced on March 8 , which were much less significant . China is now waiting to see which of its products will be subject to the new 25 % tariffs , with a list due by April 6 . At that point or soon after , another set of tariffs from China is virtually certain and it will probably apply to a lot more than $ 3 billion worth of US imports . It s guaranteed there s going to be another announcement , and it s guaranteed it s going to be much larger than what China just announced , says Scott Kennedy , director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for International and Strategic Studies in Washington . The message from China is that it s not going to be cowed into submission by American threats , and that it can outlast the United States in any trade war . Trump s tariffs are meant to address a problem many trade experts agree is legitimate : China has , in fact , cheated on trade deals in many ways . The government subsidizes many firms that compete globally , allowing them to offer products well below market value . China often requires western firms to share key technology as a condition of doing business in China . It also resorts to outright theft of trade secrets from companies in developed nations . But experts do n t agree that unilateral tariffs , imposed by the United States alone , are the right way to address the problem . One of the main reasons is that tariffs invite retaliation . The United States has a large trade deficit with China which apparently drives Trump crazy but American companies still export $ 130 billion worth of goods and services to China each year . Those producers are now vulnerable to tariffs that will make their offerings more expensive in China and cut into sales . Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs have become something of a sham , which may offer insights into the way his China tariffs evolve . Trump s initial idea was to hit all steel and aluminum imports with a tariff . But in his official announcement , he exempted Canada and Mexico from the tariffs and said other importers could apply for exemptions . The Trump administration has now issued exemptions for 67 % of all steel imports and 55 % of all aluminum imports , according to the American Action Forum . That obviously weakens the protection those tariffs were supposed to offer to domestic steel manufacturers . As a result , US Steel s ( X ) stock has plunged 23 % since the day Trump announced the tariffs . Nucor s ( NUE ) stock is down 9 % . One country not likely to get an exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs ? China . Steel imports into the US from China totaled $ 1.1 billion in 2017 , according to S&P Platt s , while aluminum imports from China totaled $ 3.3 billion for $ 4.4 billion , combined . So new Chinese tariffs on about $ 3 billion worth of US imports is of magnitude similar to the US action that preceded it . Instead of targeting a couple of key industries , as the United States did , China spread its $ 3 billion in tariffs across dozens of product categories , affecting American producers throughout the country . The purpose of choosing those specific products is they will touch a lot of small American producers , all of whom will complain to the media and the US government , says Kennedy . They re trying to create broader anxieties in the American economy about continuing this trade action . If forthcoming Chinese tariffs are proportional to Trump s duties , they ll have 15 times of the tariffs China just announced . That s the trouble markets are bracing for . Once China retaliates , Trump will have to decide whether to raise the stakes further with additional tariffs , or explain away whatever harm comes to American exporters and leave it at that . Trump , for all his tough talk , may not appreciate one particular Chinese advantage , should broader trade wars develop : China can probably endure a lot more pain than the United States . China , after all , is essentially a dictatorship in which the government controls the media and much of the economy . The United States is not , obviously , and the stock market will render prompt and unfavorable judgment on Trump s tariffs if a trade spat mushrooms into something more like a war .

		"paragraph": "Liverpool are upstaging arch-rivals Manchester United at the moment , says Danny Murphy , with Jurgen Klopp everything that Jose Mourinho is n t . On the field , those at Anfield have enjoyed a faultless start to the 2018-19 campaign , collecting maximum points from four fixtures so far . In contrast , struggles at Old Trafford have delivered just two wins to date , with pressure piled on Mourinho as a result . The Portuguese has cut a frustrated figure for several months , with a disappointing transfer market doing little to lighten his mood as talk of in-house rifts continues to do the rounds . Murphy believes Liverpool are showing how things should be done , with the man at the helm leading by example as optimism and belief builds on Merseyside and wanes in Manchester . The former Reds midfielder told the Daily Mail : At the moment Klopp is everything that Mourinho is n't . Liverpool supporters love his honesty and his enthusiasm . He 's ingratiated himself into the club , he 's made himself part of it , which is exactly what Mourinho has n't done . Mourinho has been a more successful manager and that 's ultimately what counts . But one of the most worrying things about Mourinho is the body language and the lack of fight . It 's very unlike any other Manchester United team , any Mourinho team to be honest . And I do n't see how he is going to be able to turn it around that quickly , not unless there 's a drastic change in his mentality . I do n't see that happening . Inconsistency at United could play into Liverpool s hands , with Klopp s side looking to force their way into Premier League title contention . Big-spending over the summer has helped to add greater depth to the ranks at Anfield , with Murphy of the opinion that the Reds are stronger now than they have been for a number of years . The ex-England international , who spent seven years with his boyhood club during his playing days , added : This is a good time for us . The club have given themselves a really good opportunity by strengthening the squad and creating competition for places . I 'm not sure they 'll beat City if I 'm honest , I think the gap is too big to bridge in one summer but they 'll be challengers at the very least . ",

		"paragraph": "Congratulations are in order for the newest mother in the Kardashian-Jenner clan 20-year-old Kylie Jenner . After announcing the birth of her beautiful baby girl with boyfriend Travis Scott on Instagram on Sunday , the youngest Jenner posted a video sharing never-before-seen footage from her pregnancy journey . The emotional video has people sharing their happy tears with social media , in addition to their ever-growing baby fever . But there are a few things to consider when gushing over Jenner s glorified pregnancy , in comparison to the average person s . In the first confirmation of her pregnancy , and birth , given by Jenner herself , the lip kit mogul apologized to fans for keeping them in the dark . To make up for it , she released new details , photos , and video footage of what we all missed throughout the past nine months and there s no denying that the young mom is on cloud nine . Pregnancy has been the most beautiful , empowering , and life changing experience I ve had in my entire life , Jenner wrote in her revealing post , and I m actually going to miss it . But the most important parts of what she shares with her more than 102 million followers is the acknowledgment of her vast support system , and her knowledge of the effects of potential stress to her baby . I appreciate my friends and especially my family for helping me make this special moment as private as we could , she shares . I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness . The stability that surrounds Jenner , both emotional and financial , is evident throughout the video , which is now trending No. 1 on YouTube . However , it s important for the more than 27 million people who have watched it to keep these things in mind . From one reality television star to another , Dina Manzo from The Real Housewives of New Jersey had her first child at age 22 , and she tweeted in response to Jenner s video . Having a baby at 20 is not all silk PJ s & flower walls . Most kids do n t have the $ and support you re fortunate enough to have . According to adolescent , child , and family psychologist Barbara Greenberg , the fact that Jenner is privileged enough to experience her pregnancy and childbirth as she did is no reason to shame her . But it is something to keep in mind when looking at the 20-year-old s own journey as a learning experience for others . The vast majority of young women do not have the emotional and financial resources to get through this , Greenberg says . Having and raising an infant at any age is stressful and requires a large social support system and resources . And at 20 , when you re still young , it s even harder . For Jenner , who runs her own multimillion-dollar cosmetics company , age is seemingly just a number , as a result of her extraordinary life . However , her ability to avoid some of the negative circumstances that many young mothers face does n t discount the fact that she ll need a surplus of support for the unprecedented responsibility of motherhood . This is a wonderful opportunity to reach out to young women and tell them that while little babies are very cute , they really need to keep in mind that this is a life-altering experience , Greenberg explains , and without the resources that you need , it will be a very stressful experience for both you and the baby . As Jenner s own mom , Kris , explains in the video , It definitely takes a village . And luckily , Jenner has that village at her disposal . Being pregnant alongside her older sister Khlo Kardashian and overlapping with Kim Kardashian â€˜ s surrogate s pregnancy , in addition to the extreme support from the rest of her family , and Scott s , the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister was far from alone over the past nine months . Some of the most unwavering support came from Jenner s best friend , Jordyn Woods , who also offered some wise words acknowledging the uniqueness of her friend s pregnancy . When you re 20 years old , you re just figuring out your life , Woods tells the camera , speaking to Jenner s daughter . You do n t know what you want , you re an indecisive teenager , and you re just becoming a young adult . And there was one thing that your mom knew for sure . And that was you . The sentiment , which recognizes both the mentality of most young women and Jenner s own path , sums it up as best as one could . Although motherhood may work out for 20-year-old Jenner , it s a difficult journey , and the experiences of one of media s most fascinating personas should n t solely influence others .

		"paragraph": "What s the biggest story in the country right now , the one that has the potential to affect the most Americans ? The health care bill , am I right ? The Senate bill whose details were only just revealed by the Republicans late last week , and whose vote was put off until after the July 4 congressional recess . Yet it was possible to watch all of Fox News s primetime lineup on Monday particularly Tucker Carlson Tonight and Hannity and hear barely a word about the health care debate . Why would that be ? President Trump s travel-ban legislation , ruled on by the Supreme Court , was the lead story on both Tucker and The Five . ( The Five devoted time to the health care bill 15 minutes into its broadcast . ) On Hannity , the lead story was what host Sean Hannity termed the lack of evidence of Trump administration collusion with Russia . ( That collusion has , of course , not been disproved at all that s why there s an ongoing investigation . ) Hannity said that Russia and the destroy-Trump media would be the subject of tonight s opening monologue you wo n t hear anywhere else . And the reason you wo n t hear it anywhere else is because no one else thinks that s the top story in the country . Over on MSNBC , Chris Hayes led off his 8 p.m. All In by laying out details of the health care bill , complete with bipartisan interviews that included a Republican congressman and a conservative economist . What was Carlson doing in that hour ? One of his first stories was labeled CNN Is A Campaign With A Political Mission , timed to the network s recent dismissal of three journalists . A bit later , he went to his usual bottomless well of contempt for his latest sally against political correctness , in this case ( this was the headline ) Alaska Dumps Columbus Day For Indigenous People s Day . Yes , for real : Carlson ignored health care for some inflated anger about a decision made in Alaska . With Fox News , you can be sure that if they re ignoring a big story , it s for one reason they have n t figured out their talking-point counterarguments to slam the Democrats , Obama , and Hillary Clinton yet . ( Think I m kidding about Hillary ? Hannity s second story was about how former Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch ought to be probed for her failure to investigate Clinton s blessed email server . ) It s disgraceful that Fox is n t informing its viewers about the content and consequences of the health care bill . Of course , it s also disgraceful that CNN has chosen to cover the health care legislation primarily as a game-show competition to accumulate the most points or in this case , the most congressional votes . CNN is all about The White House can only lose two votes ! storyline , rather than telling its viewers more about what s in the bill . There is a simple-minded seizing upon certain phrases that news networks hope will be the TV equivalent of clickbait words like mean ( used by both Trump and Obama to describe the current bill ) and heart ( Trump said he wanted more of it in the bill ) . Wolf Blitzer , who s never met a clich he could n t strangle , asked on Monday whether this latest version of Trumpcare had more heart than the House version . For Wolf and CNN , appealing to your emotions rather than your intellect is the path to hell . For Fox , it s about ignoring a difficult-to-explain subject until the network knows the outcome of the story . In this case , Fox looks as though it s going to wait until the Trumpcare vote is in , and will then course-correct accordingly . If the bill fails , its prime-time heads will squawk about liberal obstructionism . If it the bill passes , it will hail President Trump as having fulfilled a campaign promise . In both cases , Fox will have failed in its stated purpose of , like , journalism . But you will know which state in our Union is caving to sensitive souls who do n t like Columbus Day . Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News . All In With Chris Hayes airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on MSNBC . Hannity airs weeknights at 10 p.m. on Fox News .",

Chu s film will top the domestic box office for the third week in a row with $ 28.3 million over Labor Day Weekend . It generated a three-day tally of $ 22 million in 3,865 locations , dropping just 11 % in its third outing and bringing its domestic total to $ 110 million .

But unknown to the anchor , there was a little girl on the other side of the screen getting up early too to see someone with hair that looked just like hers on television . On Thursday , Obilor invited her mini-me , 4-year-old Karsyn , to join her on the set of her News 8 Daybreak morning broadcast so they could celebrate their natural hair together . Growing up , I did n t see any news anchors with curly hair or natural hair or even braids , Obilor said during aFacebook live segment for WFAA-TV . That s why she understands that for Karsyn , seeing a woman rock natural hair on television is a big deal . The 4-year-old s story first came to light on Sunday when her mom , Tiffny Jones , posted on Twitter about how the child would watch Obilor on television and say , Mommy ... look , my hair is like Demtria Obilor from TV . Photos of Karsyn s beauty and self-assurance touched Obilor . A few days later , the mother and daughter joined the traffic anchor on television for a special segment . Karsyn , who was full of energy , helped deliver the traffic report for Thursday morning right next to her role model . Later on , Karsyn and her mother joined Obilor for aFacebook live sessionto chat about how to care for natural hair and how important it is for little girls to see themselves represented on television . Representation ... in society is just so important for us , Jones said on the segment . I want her to see other people in the media that look just like her and for her to just rock it and be proud and embrace it . Obilor herself has faced racism in the past for her natural hair . While she was working as a traffic reporter in Las Vegas last May , she reportedly received an email from a viewer who ridiculed her hair . The viewer claimed he had to fast forward whenever [ Obilor ] comes on television . Obilor posted an image of the email to Twitter , describing it as a racist , hateful message .

So , naturally , with their Eagles going to the Super Bowl for the first time in 13 years , for every story about Nick Foles or a dominant defensive line , there is a headline about the fans themselves . And mostly , of course , about their raucous or appalling behavior . Minnesotans , coping not only with defeat but also the prospect of hosting those fans for the Super Bowl , are particularly peeved . They re alleging hat thievery , urine-related incidents and random acts of violence . They re not going to let the storyline die . And in that regard , their quarterback is helping them out . Case Keenum appeared on The Dan Barreiro Show on KFAN in Minneapolis on Tuesday , and when asked about Vikings fans , he went out of his way to mention some other fans that we may have dealt with recently that even our girls had to deal with recently . Of course , he meant Eagles fans . A few minutes later , when asked to follow up on the treatment of family members in Philadelphia , he declined to get specific , but hinted at some ugliness : On one hand , it s difficult to get too worked up about comments that are so vague . On the other , there s precedent here . We know that verbal abuse and beer-bottle throwing were features of the Viking fan experience in Philadelphia on Sunday . We know that some Eagles fans pelted the Vikings team bus with eggs and containers of all kinds . We also know that Eagles fans have a history of crossing the line with their treatment of opposing players family members . I heard that s the one stadium you keep your family from going to , Redskins running back Chris Thompson said earlier this season . I was told that right away my rookie year : Keep your family away . Keenum s comments , therefore , are n t all that surprising . Which is exactly the problem . Philadelphians would surely like us to point out that most NFL cities are home to unruly , rude , and at times abusive fans . Philly is n t unique . They d also probably like us to point out that the fans who did dole out tough treatment to Keenum s family are in the minority . The majority of Eagles followers just wanted to celebrate by driving dune buggies up the Art Museum steps and climbing light poles . But for the first NFC championship game in Philly in 13 years , it does seem like the treatment of opposing fans was especially harsh . And apparently the Keenums were n t immune to it .",

HuffPo reported that several Fox News employees said Guilfoyle was regularly discussing sexual matters at work and engaging in emotionally abusive behavior toward hair and makeup artists and support staff . Guilfoyle also had a habit of sharing pictures of male genitalia and pointing out who the men were in the pictures according to HuffPo . Guilfoyle s attorney , John Singer , provided the following statement : Also Read : Kimberly Guilfoyle Out at Fox News The HR investigation into Guilfoyle started last year , after the host had been warned several times about her workplace behavior , according to HuffPo . Guilfoyle had been angling to buy time in order to win support from Rupert Murdoch , Fox s head honcho , according to HuffPo . Guilfoyle exited Fox last week , where she was a popular co-host of The Five . The 49-year-old is in an increasingly serious relationship with President Trump s son , Don Trump Jr. , which has raised questions about whether she could cover politics for the network without the appearance of bias . Also Read : Fox News Host Kimberly Guilfoyle Parties With Trump and Don Jr at White House Look , they seem to be a cute couple and I love a good love story . But does n t this radically affect her day job ? CNN media reporter Brian Stelter said on an episode of Reliable Sources earlier this month . How can any of her colleagues criticize Trump when the president s son s girlfriend is sitting right there at the table ? Does n t this complicate the entire network s coverage of the Trump family ? he added . Don Jr. filed for divorce from his wife of 13 years , Vanessa , in April .

		"paragraph": "It was February 23 , 2015 , during an episode of WWE Monday Night Raw when a tag team bout pitting The Bella Twins against Paige and Emma ended after just 30 seconds . It was the straw that broke the company s back after years of presenting women s wrestling as little more than a titillating sideshow or bathroom break fodder . Paige and Emma had taken great strides in altering the perception of women s wrestling on the fledgling NXT brand , and so their main roster mistreatment was met with fan backlash . The moment kick-started the #GiveDivasAChance campaign , forcing WWE to change their approach and presentation of the women s division . The Mae Young Classic the first four episodes of which are now available on the WWE Network is the greatest evidence of how far we ve come in such a short time . While the company is now very much patting themselves on the back for fixing a problem they created in the first place , it s hard to deny the positive changes over the past two years . Superstars like Charlotte , Sasha Banks , Bayley , Becky Lynch , Asuka and Alexa Bliss have helped elevate women s wrestling from the lower card to an integral part of weekly programming . It s no longer a rare occurrence to see women headlining shows just this week Banks and Bliss main evented Raw for the Women s Championship . Last year , Banks and Charlotte became the first women to main event a WWE Pay-Per-View and the first to compete inside the Hell in a Cell . That s not to say everything about the current iteration of WWE s women s division is perfect it s still bogged down with creative issues and odd booking decisions . The constant hot-potatoing of the Raw Women s Championship , the inability to create effective babyfaces , and repetitive storylines being the worst crimes . Those sorts of problems are not limited to the women , they plague WWE as a whole , but nothing the male roster faced this year has been quite as insulting as having a man retrieve the first ever Women s Money In The Bank briefcase . The hope heading into this tournament is that WWE will allow the 32 women to go out there and do their thing without the restrictions that often hamper the women on Raw and Smackdown . In the same way the Cruiserweight and UK tournaments introduced fans to the incredible lightweight and British talent outside WWE , the Mae Young Classic will hopefully expose the world to the fact that there are terrific women wrestlers out there on the indie scene busting their asses , earning their stripes , and putting on fantastic matches . The WWE talks a lot about the evolution of the women s division and trademarked taglines aside the Mae Young Classic really does have the chance to take women s wrestling to heights it s never been before . As has become customary for these tournaments , those working behind the scenes do everything they can to make the event feel special . The presentation is brilliant from the graphics to the video packages to the set-up of the arena . Dimming the lights on the crowd has a tremendous effect , not only does it emphasize the action taking place in the ring , but it discourages idiotic fans from starting Mexican Waves and batting around beach balls . The short introductory videos bring emotional weight to each participant s story , whether it be Mia Yim talking about her experience with domestic abuse or Serena Deeb opening up about her past alcohol problems . It makes you feel not only invested but an immense joy for all of these women for having achieved this dream . Kay Lee Ray versus Princesca Sugehit is also the perfect match to kick things off and warm up the crowd . It s a more hard-hitting affair than the aerial encounter one might have expected from a luchadora and a hardcore high-flyer , but the pace is fast and energetic nonetheless . Ray has the Full Sail fans behind her and even hits her Gory Bomb finisher , but it s Sugehit who advances after submitting the fiery Scot to the Fujiwara armbar . Ray leaving the tournament this early is somewhat of a surprise after she was one of the highlighted competitors in the Bracketology special . Things work out better for the other featured competitors , including Shayna Baszler , the ex-MMA fighter who has Ronda Rousey cheering her on at ringside . Baszler , who looks like Bayley s evil doppelganger , makes quick work of Zeda , who talks in her video of being bullied growing up . Baszler , naturally , plays the bully in the match , refusing to shake hands and slapping her opponent around the ring . In a fantastic finish , Baszler counters Zeda s guillotine into a vertical suplex position before dropping her down to the mat into a rear-naked choke for the win . Baszler s dominance and cockiness appear to be positioning her as the big bad of the Mae Young Classic . On the flip side is lovable New Zealander Dakota Kai , who portrays the scrappy underdog in her encounter with Kavita Devi , the first Indian woman to compete in WWE . Devi displays impressive speed and agility for someone of her size , but it s Kai s connection with the crowd and explosive offense which makes her a favorite to win this whole tournament . The same could be said for Toni Storm and Rhea Ripley , the two other Antipodean athletes in the competition . Storm has a swagger and charisma which just ca n t be taught , while Ripley is a FUTURE STAR in the making . At only 20 years old , people might mistake Ripley for a rookie , but she s been wrestling for four years in Australia and Japan , and you can see how crisp her ring-work is against Miranda Salinas . Unlike the Cruiserweight Classic and the United Kingdom Championship tournament where the majority of the field was made up of experienced pros the Mae Young Classic is comprised of both veterans and rookies . That means a lot of these first round matches sees established ring-generals going up against inexperienced newcomers , which understandably leads to some awkward encounters and slower paced action . Take Xia Li for example , who is competing in her FIRST EVER MATCH against 16-year-pro Mercedes Martinez . A wrestler s first match usually takes place at some high school gym in front of a handful of punters and a janitor , not on the grand stage of WWE with the world watching . To Li s credit , she gives a respectable account of herself she has a cool look and a killer entrance routine involving a foldable fan . While Li is obviously super green inside the ring , Martinez uses her experience to control the structure of the match and make Li s offense look threatening . It s clear Martinez is holding back and working a slower pace to accommodate the first-timer , but that is the mark of a true professional . Li will have picked up some valuable tips in this short five-minute match-up , while Martinez continues into Round 2 where she will be able to show off more of her skill set against more experienced competitors . Serena Deeb and Sage Beckett play a similar teacher role in their matches against rookies Vanessa Borne and Bianca Belair , respectively . Deeb , returning to WWE after a seven-year hiatus , plays the babyface against the heel Borne and allows the former NFL cheerleader to dominate a good chunk of the match before putting her away with the Spear . Borne lacks grace in her movements , and her selling needs improvement , but her performance shines with attitude and confidence she also hits a nice Swinging Neckbreaker from the second rope . Belair is more promising particularly the way she sells Beckett s high impact moves . It s clear the WWE brass see big things for the accomplished college athlete and putting her over a ten-year pro like Beckett is a sign of the faith they have in her . All of the first round matches have something to offer , whether from an entertainment standpoint or as an opportunity to build character and experience for the young up and comers . The only real clunker of Round 1 is Marti Belle versus Rachel Evers . For whatever reason , these two women just do not gel with one another , the pacing of the match feels off , and it leads to some uncomfortable botches and mistimed maneuvers . It s a shame because character wise Belle knows how to play up her heel tendencies and draw heat , and Evers , while relatively inexperienced , has a lot of potential . But sometimes in wrestling , the chemistry is just off , and that , unfortunately , is the fate that befell Belle and Evers . It s no surprise the best matches are those that pit the more experienced women against one another . Abbey Laith and Jazzy Gabert steal the show in Episode 1 . The two smashmouth superstars come out of the gates swinging and instantly bring Full Sail to their feet , particularly Gabert who becomes an unlikely fan favorite . Gabert , with her Ivan Drago-style haircut , uses her size and power to intimidate the smaller Laith who relies on her ballet background to swiftly escape the Alpha Female s grasp before taking her attack to the air . Laith is officially under contract with WWE and also uses Mae Young s Alligator Clutch as her finisher so her victory is expected , but with Gabert s positive reaction it would n t shock me to see her signed in the near future . Mia Yim and Sarah Logan similarly used their cumulative experience to put on a corker of a match in Episode 2 . The crowd is evenly split for both women as they nail each other with vicious strikes and kicks , including a beautiful cartwheel into a running knee from Logan . Yim pins Logan for the win after using the Eat Defeat in tribute to her mentor and personal friend Gail Kim . This is the kind of match where both competitors come out looking like a million bucks the world-traveled yet unsigned veteran Yim gets to move on in the tournament while the signed yet underutilized Logan gets to show exactly what she s capable of in the squared circle . Two other unsigned women looking to make an impact are Piper Niven and Santana Garrett , who tear the house down in Episode 3 . Niven rag-dolls Garrett across the ring , flattening her with savage splashes and decapitating clothleslines . Garret uses her speed and athleticism to fight back , hitting a series of stunning maneuvers , including a Springboard DDT from the second rope and a Handstand Avalanche Hurricanrana . The more powerful Niven puts a stop to Garrett s flurry of offense , finishing her with a devastating Michinoku Driver . Obviously , WWE ca n t sign everyone who comes through the performance center doors , but it s a real shame these two women are n t already under contract , especially Garrett who has the prototypical WWE look and the ability to match . The three matches mentioned above are all top quality , but Kairi Sane versus Tessa Blanchard blows them all away in Episode 4 . It s unfortunate that it s a first round match , as it would have been nice to see both women advance , but that just makes the stakes even higher . The way Sane moves around the ring seems so effortless she makes every move look impactful , whether she is delivering them or taking them . Also , her pirate gimmick is a license to print money ( I d buy a miniature Kairi Sane ship s wheel ! ) . As for Blanchard , she leaves it all in the ring , knowing that this is going to be her only match in the tournament . The Full Sail crowd is invested in every moment from Blanchard s top rope senton to Sane s beautiful diving elbow drop . Sane is already under contract , while Blanchard remains unsigned but after a performance like that , one hopes the company will be positioning these two women at the forefront of a post-Asuka NXT . The post-match embrace between these two mighty competitors is the perfect image to end Round 1 of this historic tournament a moment of shared celebration for women s wrestling . Extra Thoughts * If I had one criticism to make about the presentation , it would be the commentary . As great as it is to hear the voice of Jim Ross , his chemistry with Lita felt stilted , and both Hall of Famers seemed to lack info about the competitors and their move sets . It s a shame , because Daniel Bryan and Mauro Ranallo brought such enthusiasm and knowledge to last year s Cruiserweight Classic and similarly , Nigel McGuinness and an on-his-game Michael Cole elevated the in-ring action of the United Kingdom Championship tournament . * A warm welcome to Jessika Carr , WWE s first full-time female referee since the 80s . For those that do n t know , Carr used to wrestle on the indie scene under the name Kennadi Brink . * Out of all the rookies , I think I was most impressed by Taynara Conti , the Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitor . Her throwdowns were unique , and she had a look of intensity on her face that drew me in . She still has a long way to go , and I think advancing fellow rookie Lacey Evans ahead of her was the right decision , but at 22 years old , Conti has bags of potential . * I AM A MISSILE ! Sorry . I ca n t get that theme song out of my head . * I ca n t help but worry every time Bianca Belair is in the ring that someone is going to step on her braid . Puts me on edge . * Kacy Catanzaro of American Ninja Warrior fame was at ringside , and as JR mentioned on commentary , she recently signed a developmental contract with WWE . * Candice LeRae and Nicole Savoy did n t really get a chance to demonstrate their full potential . Again , this is partly due to working with less experienced opponents and the relative shortness of the matches having to fit four matches into a 50-minute episode is tough . The Queen of Suplexes did n t even deliver one suplex ! Thankfully both women are advancing and so should be able to show off their skills when they face each other in Round 2 . * The Round 2 matches are as follows : Abbey Laith vs. Rachel Evers Princesa Sugehit vs. Mercedes Martinez Nicole Savoy vs. Candice LeRae Mia Yim vs. Shayna Baszler Kairi Sane vs. Bianca Belair Dakota Kai vs. Rhea Ripley Serena Deeb vs. Piper Niven Lacey Evans vs. Toni Storm The first four episodes of the Mae Young Classic are now available on the WWE Network . Episodes 5-8 will be available on demand on Monday , Sept. 4 . The final match will stream live from Las Vegas on Tuesday , Sept. 12 , at 10 p.m. ET .

		"paragraph": "A school librarian who rejected a shipment of books from Melania Trump for their racist undertones was brandished divisive by the first lady . Liz Phipps Soeiro is a librarian at Cambridgeport School in Massachusetts and the recipient of an honor bestowed to one high-achieving school library in each state . To coincide with National Read a Book Day on Sept. 6 , each library received a package of 10 Dr. Seuss books : Seuss-isms ! Because a Little Bug Went KaChoo What Pet Should I Get ? The Cat in the Hat I Can Read With My Eyes Shut ! One Fish , Two Fish , Red Fish , Blue Fish The Foot Book Wacky Wednesday Green Eggs and Ham and Oh , the Places You ll Go ! Melania has called Oh , the Places You ll Go ! a favorite book , reading it aloud to children at a New York City hospital in March for Read Across America Day ( also Dr. Seuss s birthday ) , much like Michelle Obama in past years . However , Phipps Serio declined the shipment , explaining her reasoning on the Horn Blog Tuesday . Dear Mrs. Trump , my students were interested in reading your enclosed letter and impressed with the beautiful bookplates with your name and the indelible White House stamp , she wrote . However , we will not be keeping the titles for our collection . I d like to respectfully offer my explanation . Phipps Serio highlighted her amazing school district adding , School libraries around the country are being shuttered . Cities like Philadelphia , Chicago , and Detroit are suffering through expansion , privatization , and school â€˜ choice with no interest in outcomes of children , their families , their teachers , and their schools . Are those kids any less deserving of books simply because of circumstances beyond their control ? Why not go out of your way to gift books to underfunded and underprivileged communities that continue to be marginalized and maligned by policies put in place by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos ? Why not reflect on those high standards of excellence beyond only what the numbers suggest ? Secretary DeVos would do well to scaffold and lift schools instead of punishing them with closures and slashed budgets . Then , Phipps Serio turned her attention to the subject matter of the books . So , my school does n t have a NEED for these books . And then there s the matter of the books themselves . You may not be aware of this , but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature . She continued by name-checking specific books . Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda , caricatures , and harmful stereotypes . Open one of his books ( If I Ran a Zoo or And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street , for example ) , and you ll see the racist mockery in his art . â€¦ Scholar Philip Nel s new book , Was the Cat in the Hat Black ? The Hidden Racism of Children s Literature , and the Need for Diverse Books , further explores and shines a spotlight on the systemic racism and oppression in education and literature . You and your husband have a direct impact on these children s lives , wrote Phipps Serio . Please make time to learn about and value them . I hope you share these books with your family and with kids around the country . And I encourage you to reach out to your local librarian for more recommendations . Yahoo Lifestyle could not reach Phipps Serio , and her social media channels appear to have been removed . But that did n t stop people from tweeting their disapproval of the librarian s gesture . Stephanie Grisham , White House director of communications , released the following statement to various media outlets . [ The first lady ] has demonstrated [ her commitment to children ] in both actions and words since her husband took office , and sending books to children across the country is but one example . To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate , but the first lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere .

		"paragraph": "Fans at San Diego Comic-Conn 2018 were treated to new exclusive footage from Aquaman Saturday at the very end of the Warner Bros . Hall H panel . But we did say exclusive , so you wo n t see it online anytime soon . Luckily we were there so here s what we saw in the footage , which expanded on the hero s quest to protect the worlds of the depths and of the surface . The footage starts with Aquaman , a.k.a. Arthur Curry ( Jason Momoa ) , talking about his parents in an extended version of what fans saw in the first Aquaman trailer released earlier Saturday . Arthur s father was a human lighthouse keeper who saved his mother , the queen of Atlantis . The two fell in love and had Arthur , who bridges the world beneath the ocean and the land . One day , his mother hopes , he ll return to Atlantis to lead his people . Next , the video cut to the Sahara Desert definitely not a great place for a guy called Aquaman to find himself . Arthur and Mera ( Amber Heard ) , his fellow Atlantean , march across the dunes , and Arthur remarks that there s no way something from Atlantis could be so far inland . He s wrong , though , and the pair soon find themselves in a strange ruin . Also Read : ' Aquaman ' Makes Huge Splash at Comic-Con in First Trailer ( Video ) Inside , they find an ancient device . Mera inserts some kind of cylinder that she was carrying into it , but after a beat , nothing happens . Arthur remarks that the place has been ruins since before the Sahara was a desert . Mera , realizing the place was once underwater , wipes some sweat from Arthur s face and uses the moisture to activate the machine , causing it to glow with a blue light . A hologram of an old Atlantean king tells them about a goal of uniting the surface world with the ocean world , and explains that the key to doing so is a powerful trident . The message ends and Mera smashes the cylinder to hide the message from anyone else , saying she memorized its information . When she asks Arthur if he memorized it too , he says , Yeah it was something something trident . Next , Arthur and Mera are chased through a desert city by the movie s villain , Black Manta ( Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) , who uses powerful red lasers to try to cut the heroes down . The pair get separated as Manta s red-clad minions chase Mera , smashing through buildings while she sprints across the rooftops above .

		"paragraph": "Colorado prosecutors are demanding that triple-murder suspect Chris Watts turn over DNA samples , fingerprints palm prints and photographs of his hands in their case against him in the deaths of his pregnant wife , Shan ann Watts , and their two young daughters . In a motion filed Thursday , prosecutors asked the judge to compel Chris to provide them the evidence . The court has not yet ruled on the motion and the defense has until Monday to respond . A source close to the case says prosecutors are working very carefully . They know they ca n t make a single mistake . Chris , 33 , faces first-degree murder charges among other charges related to the killings of his 34-year-old wife and their two daughters , Celeste , 3 , and 4-year-old Bella . Under police questioning , Chris allegedly admitted he had strangled Shan ann but he gave a startling reason for doing so . According to an arrest affidavit obtained by PEOPLE , he claimed that after he told Shan ann he wanted to separate , he saw her strangling Celeste while Bella was blue and apparently lifeless in her bed nearby . Chris purportedly said he went into a rage and strangled Shan ann , the arrest affidavit states . Afterward he allegedly loaded all three bodies into his truck to conceal them at an oil work site some 40 miles east owned by his former employer . Authorities are n t buying this explanation and in charging Chris with first-degree murder in all three deaths , they have dismissed his version of events as described in the affidavit . Chris was arrested late on Aug. 15 , the day before the bodies of his wife and daughters were found . He is being held without bond in the Weld County Jail . He has not yet entered a plea . RELATED VIDEO : Triple Murder Suspect Dad Chris Watts in Court A source close to the investigation previously told PEOPLE , The theory that she [ Shan ann ] did it does n t hold any water . There is absolutely no evidence that she killed her children .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap of The Bachelorette Episode 8 contains spoilers . The final four , rose lovers ! Hometown dates are here , the time in the Bachelorette s life where she visits four families and chooses to eliminate the one she least wants to visit on major holidays . Let s get to it ! Date No. 1 : Eric Location : Baltimore No . of Family Members Present : 9 Rachel meets Eric in a park alongside Baltimore s waterfront ( the focus of many episodes of the best TV show of all time , The Wire ) , aka the nice part of the city , notes Eric . But this is not the realness of where Eric comes from . They hop into the car and head into Eric s old neighborhood , which has a far more inner-city feel . Fun fact : Even in heels , the Bachelorette can ball . Eric s old friend Ralph drops by the court and praises his buddy for taking a different path and being a stellar student growing up . When the time comes for Rachel to head to Eric s aunt s house , she s feeling a lot of pressure , because she s the first woman Eric has ever introduced to his relatives . And she s got cameras in tow ! Should n t be weird at all . On the other hand , they sure get a warm welcome : Aunt Verna sits down with Rachel first , and she wants to talk about r-a-c-e specifically , how did Rachel deal with being the first black Bachelorette ? I m getting judged by black people , and I m getting judged by everybody else , admits Rachel . Love does n t have a color , so my journey for love should n t be any different than the other 12 Bachelorettes that were in front of me . Verna likes what she hears , and is very pleased to see how thrilled Eric is in this relationship . He s not a person who s afraid of commitment . We also get to meet Eric s mom , Karen , who is the one he says did n t show him love as a child . And her explanation is pretty heartbreaking : There are a lot of great men in our family , but a lot of them did n t reach their stars because they always reached for what was next to them , which was their mother . And I did n t want that for you . They ve moved past their issues now , though , and their conversation ends with a sweet hug . Things get even more moving when Eric sits down with his dad , who apologizes for some of the mistakes he made when Eric was younger . Yeah , man , I love you , man ! says dad . I m gon na love you forever ! And they share the father-son version of a hug : a handshake . Before Eric bids the Bachelorette goodbye , he tells her that earlier in the day he thought to himself , Damn , I really love this girl , which he translates to mean , I really care about you , like a lot . So it s not exactly a full L-bomb , but the Bachelorette does n t seemed too fazed by it . I reaaaally like Eric , says Rachel . I m definitely falling for Eric . Date No. 2 : Bryan Location : Miami No . of Family Members Present : 5 Bienvenido a Miami , rose lovers ! But not the touristy parts , mind you Bryan wants to show Rachel the real Miami , so he meets her at Domino Park . After getting their butts beat in dominoes by two cute old dudes , Rachel and Bryan sample some local cuisine and do a quick impromptu salsa . But a cloud hangs over the day in the shape of Bryan s mother . Will she deem the Bachelorette worthy of her only child , or will she rain on Rachel s love parade ? Let s find out . Olga , Bryan s mom , greets Rachel and her son ( aka the most precious thing I have in my life ) warmly , but she s obviously feeling a little stressed out . We really have such a wonderful relationship , that for me a woman that separate him from me that would be terrible , Olga tells us . So she s not about to let her baby boy walk off with some reality TV star . You have gone out with so many girls , and you go to a show , and you fall in love with the girl of the show ? says Olga , with a wry laugh . I m in shock ! Mom wants Bryan to take his time and get to know this woman before doing anything rash . And she knows if she messes with the mother , that s not good , warns Olga . That s not being smart . Because we are blood . Over in another room , Bryan s stepsister ( or cousin ? family friend ? Bryan referred to himself as his mother s only child ) is filling Rachel in on why things did n t work out with Bryan s last girlfriend . She was threatened by the relationship that he had with his mother , says the unidentified brunette . She wanted him for herself , so that was her demise . Is it me , or is it starting to sound like Bryan s family is in the mafia ? Case in point : I want to give you a warning , says Olga when she sits down with Rachel . You are marrying the family too . And in case you re still not convinced : Rachel chooses to believe that Olga s joking about this â€¦ â€¦ but she really , REALLY is n t . Anyhow , mom tells us that it was very , very nice , a pleasure , to meet Rachel . Maybe she s the one . But it still makes her cry to say it . The night goes well enough that Bryan feels comfortable hitting his emotional mark : I m very happy right now , he tells our Bachelorette . Rachel , I m in love with you . Date No. 3 : Peter Location : Madison , Wis . No . of Family Members Present : 6 ( 4 adults , 2 babies ) Our salt-and-pepper stud greets Rachel in a sunny downtown square , where they stroll through a farmers market before heading to a local joint to meet some of Peter s friends . I consider my friends an extension of my family , he explains . If [ Rachel ] can fit seamlessly into that group , it s going be an amazing thing . Rachel tells the group that early on Peter made sure to let her know that eight of his really close friends are black . Awwww , they kid because they love . After a while , Peter pulls his two male buddies aside and confesses his deepest fear : The idea is that three weeks from basically today , I should be able to get down on one knee and propose and it s f *** ing terrifying . This , ladies and gentlemen , is the appropriate response to this show and everything it stands for . Peter s friends definitely have some thoughts on this matter too , but they re either too polite or too intimidated by the cameras to speak their minds . Instead : Instead , Peter s buddies assure him that Rachel seems great , they seem to be clicking , and that he should n t be scared of the future . That puts Peter s mind at ease a bit , but he s still not about to go ring shopping ( until Neil Lane shows up at his door , that is ) . I do n t make rash decisions , he reminds us . That s not who I am . OK , Kraus family you re up ! Peter introduces Rachel to his mom , Lynn his dad , Gary brother David sister-in-law Brooke and their two kids , Hudson and Charlotte . They re a very welcoming group , right down to the marquee in their home theater . In my heart , I feel like he s ready for this , Brooke tells Rachel . I hope that soon he ll be able to show you that . Peter hopes so too , but as he tells his mom , he s worried that in three weeks when he s supposed to propose , I ll still have my walls up , and I ll regret missing an opportunity . Mom supports him no matter what , of course , but she s also not going to tell Rachel what she wants to hear . Let s listen in : As I mentioned before , I find this pretty confusing . So Peter s ready to start a family and have commitment to a person , but it may not be a marriage ? Once you re ready to have kids with a life partner , what s the barrier to marriage , pal ? I suppose it could be any number of things , but again , try to remember this rule of thumb : If the idea of marrying someone makes you nervous , do not agree to be a contestant on The Bachelorette . Testify , girlfriend . Rachel s worries grow when Peter does n t offer the customary I love you or I m falling in love with you or I m in love with you that all Bachelorettes expect after the hometown visit . Instead , all she gets from him is , I m very happy right now . Date No. 4 : Dean Location : Aspen , Colo . No . of Family Members Present : 6 At last , rose lovers , the main event . As we know from Dean ( and from the coming up promos ) , this hometown date is not going to be of the warm-and-fuzzy variety . Dean has n t seen his dad in two years , so he s not exaggerating when he says , Today will be difficult . But first , a picturesque picnic . Rachel will be meeting Dean s brothers , Brad and Ross his sister , Skye and Brad s girlfriend , Ashley . And she ll also come face-to-face with Dean s dad , a converted Kundalini yoga Sikh whose name is Paramroop . ( I m not even going to pretend I spelled that right , but you get the idea . ) It means â€˜ divinely beautiful , and it s a self-given name so that speaks a little bit to his character , explains Dean with a sad laugh . This is new as of six years ago , so he s not the father I had growing up . Dean s stepmom , Sintontaur ( again , sp ??? ) , will be there too . Dean also admits that he s never really told his father how abandoned he felt after his mom passed away , and Rachel s look says it all . Well , I m just saying , like , maybe you should tell him he was n t . ( And do it on camera , yell all the Team Bachelorette producers from the control room . ) It s hard not to feel for Dean as he and Rachel walk up the road toward Paramroop s ramshackle house . It s the first time Dean s whole family has been under the same roof in eight years , and he is definitely not ready . This is going to be awful , he whispers to Rachel . Let s just get through it . The welcome is a less than traditional one , in Bachelorette terms . Where s the table at ? Why are we all on the floor ? asks Dean with a nervous giggle . Rachel is unfazed , and begins greeting everyone in the family with hugs . Poor Dean tells us that his strategy for surviving the day is suppressing every single emotion that I m trying to feel , just keeping it down , buried far down as it can go . And that s not going to be easy , especially when Paramroop presents Dean and Rachel with two feathers , as symbols of the love and spirit of Dean s late mom , Debbie . Oy , his sad face is just killing me . After dinner , Rachel and Skye retire to a swing in the backyard and talk about Dean s anger toward his dad , and the need for the two of them to talk out their issues . He s been through a lot and he s always been , like , the strongest person , says Skye through her tears . I really admire him about that so much . Inside , meanwhile , Dean is tentatively broaching the subject of the past with his dad . Do you remember the disagreements we had when I was in high school , after mom passed away ? he asks Paramroop . Did you understand my frustration at that point ? Dean s dad says he was absolutely there for the family after Debbie s death , but admits he was angry too . It was horrible watching your mother die ! he cries . That s why I was angry . It s an intense , raw conversation , and not easy to watch . The pathos of Paramroop s situation a grieving dad being thrust into the role of sole parent to three devastated kids is tantamount to Dean s . But unfortunately that pain does n t unite father and son it just pushes them farther apart . There were a lot of moments where I personally felt abandoned , Dean tells his dad , and it seems that s too much for Paramroop to bear . If you really feel that way , he says , there s really no need to carry [ on ] this conversation is you so whatever you think of me , is really what you think of yourself . There s nothing to work through , Paramroop continues the real problem is that Dean has one f *** ing foot stuck in the past . With that , the conversation is over . Paramroop goes outside to cool off , but there he finds Rachel . Can I talk to you for a second ? she asks . If you must , is the curt reply . Paramroop reluctantly sits down to talk , but then he remembers the cameras . No , no . I regret this , says Dean s dad , standing up . This does n t work . He tells Rachel that should she and Dean stay together , they are more than welcome to visit again , but he s still reeling from the revelation that his son has such harsh feelings about him , and so tonight , he s done . The Bachelorette goes back inside to find a despondent Dean lying on a pile of pillows . Even with or perhaps because of all the evening s emotional tumult , Dean still has the presence of mind to make one final sales pitch to Rachel . I m falling in love with you , he murmurs , and Rachel seems happy to hear it . I m falling in love with you too , she replies softly . Or is she ? Rose Ceremony Location : Dallas No . of Family Members Present : 1 ( Papa Harrison ) The host has Rachel walk him through her feelings for each man after the hometown dates . Eric has a wonderful energy , but is he truly in love or is it just infatuation ? Bryan is the only one who professed his love , though his family was a little skeptical at first . Peter remains a little too reserved , while Dean does n t know what to do with all these feelings . Still , Rachel says she s really struggling with the idea of sending someone home . Oh , girl , just rip the Band-Aid off already . Making the decision that I have to tonight has not been easy , says the Bachelorette . I m so sorry that I have to do this . And the roses go to : Bryan , Eric , and â€¦ Peter . Ugh , this poor kid . Stoic to the end , Dean walks arm-in-arm to the Bye-Bye Bench with Rachel . She assures him she meant it when she said she was falling in love with him , but she s just not convinced he s ready for marriage . I hope you find what you re looking for , replies Dean sadly . As he walks out of the hotel to the waiting Reject Limo , it s impossible not to wonder â€¦ why are his pants always so damn tight ? I m shocked and confused , Dean tells us . I think she s an incredible woman . I just think that tonight she made a mistake . On that note , rose lovers , what do you think ? Did Rachel make the right choice ? Did Dean s family scare her off , or did she truly think he was n t ready ? And seriously , did Rachel forget that Bryan s mom threatened to kill her ? Post your thoughts now !

		"paragraph": "Michael Cohen spoke to Mueller team for hours asked about Russia , possible collusion , pardon : Sources originally appeared on abcnews.go.com President Donald Trump s former personal attorney , Michael Cohen , has participated over the last month in multiple interview sessions lasting for hours with investigators from the office of special counsel , Robert Mueller , sources tell ABC News . The special counsel s questioning of Cohen , one of the president s closest associates over the past decade , has focused primarily on all aspects of Trump 's dealings with Russia -- including financial and business dealings and the investigation into alleged collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign and its surrogates to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election , sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News . Investigators were also interested in knowing , the sources say , whether Trump or any of his associates discussed the possibility of a pardon with Cohen . Over the 16 months that Mueller has been investigating , the president has repeatedly bashed the investigation as a partisan witch hunt , insisting there has been no collusion and no obstruction of justice . The interviews with Cohen took place in Washington , D.C. , and New York City . They were also attended in part by prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney s Office in the Southern District of New York . ( MORE : EXCLUSIVE : Michael Cohen says family and country , not President Trump , is his ' first loyalty ' ) Cohen s participation in the meetings has been voluntary -- without any guarantee of leniency from prosecutors , according to several people familiar with the situation . ABC News has also learned that Cohen is also cooperating with a separate probe by New York state authorities into the inner workings of the Trump family charity and the Trump Organization , where Cohen served as an executive vice president and special counsel to Trump for 10 years . The news of Cohen s dealings with federal and state investigators comes close on the heels of another potentially perilous legal development for the president : the guilty pleas last week from Trump s former campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , who struck a deal with Mueller s prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation . As the Manafort deal was taking shape -- Mueller s team had already been talking to Cohen . ( MORE : Michael Cohen could be key witness in state investigation of Trump charity ) And given Cohen s prolonged time spent in proximity to Trump , his family and the inner-workings of the Trump Organization , some insiders consider his cooperation with authorities to be one of most serious potential legal threats to confront the president . Both of these guys want to be loved and they both want loyalty , says a person close to both President Trump and Cohen , who asked not to be named in order to speak freely . Cohen s disavowal of Trump has triggered a series of events that turned once very good friends into permanent enemies . The consequences for both will be ugly . President Trump and his lawyers have lately been harshly critical of Cohen ever since he made clear earlier this year , in an exclusive interview with ABC News , that he was willing to cooperate with prosecutors , even if that placed the president in legal or political jeopardy . The former Trump loyalist said in the interview he rejected Trump s claims that the Mueller investigation was a witch hunt orchestrated by his political enemies . Cohen vowed to put family and country first . ( MORE : Michael Cohen , Trump s former longtime personal attorney , pleads guilty to illegal campaign contributions ' at the direction of a candidate for federal office ' ) Rudy Giuliani , Trump s current personal attorney , who in May called Cohen an honest , honorable lawyer , has more recently claimed that Cohen is fabricating stories about Trump in order to protect himself . ( MORE : Michael Cohen has information ' of interest ' to Robert Mueller , would not accept Trump pardon , lawyer says ) There s nobody that I know that knows him that has n t warned me that if his back is up against the wall , he ll lie like crazy , because he s lied all his life , Giuliani told CNN in July . Last month in New York , Cohen pleaded guilty to eight felonies , including bank fraud , tax evasion and two campaign finance violations in connection with alleged hush money payments to women who have claimed affairs with Trump . Mueller s team had referred the investigation of those crimes to federal prosecutors in New York , which led subsequently to coordinated raids of Cohen s law office and residences in April . At a plea hearing in August , Cohen told a federal judge that he had arranged for the payments to two women in coordination with , and at the direction of a candidate for federal office , \" referring to then-candidate Trump , and added that he participated in the transactions with the principal purpose of influencing the election . Those statements , under oath , were an about-face from Cohen s public comments about his role in the deals with Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford , aka Stormy Daniels . Cohen had previously insisted that he d paid Clifford with his own money , on his own initiative and without the knowledge of Trump . The president has long denied the allegations of the affairs with McDougal and Clifford and has claimed he did not know in advance about the deals Cohen secured . On the day of Cohen s court appearance , the president openly mocked him on Twitter . If anyone is looking for a good lawyer , I would strongly suggest that you do n t retain the services of Michael Cohen ! the president wrote . Since entering his guilty pleas last month -- Cohen has also been in contact with the New York Attorney General s office , according to multiple people close to the matter . In June , the New York Attorney General , Barbara Underwood , filed a civil lawsuit accusing Trump 's charitable foundation and its directors of having \" operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities \" for more than a decade by paying off legal bills with charitable funds , promoting Trump hotels , and purchasing personal items . The lawsuit names Trump , his sons Don Jr. and Eric , and his daughter , Ivanka , as defendants . A representative of the Trump Foundation called the lawsuit , politics at its very worst . Underwood s office has not ruled out launching a state criminal investigation into the foundation if the evidence warrants it . And she has also asked the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission to look into the charity s operations . A spokesperson for the New York Attorney General s office declined to comment for this report . In a prior public statement from the office , the spokesperson Amy Spitalnick said : We can not comment on potential or ongoing investigations . As our lawsuit against the Trump Foundation illustrates , we will hold Donald Trump and his associates accountable for violations of state law , and will seek a criminal referral from the appropriate state agency as necessary . Cohen s relationship with Trump dates to the mid-2000 s after Cohen , who owned condominiums in multiple Trump buildings in New York , took Trump s side in a legal dispute with the condo board at Trump World Tower on Manhattan s East Side . He joined the Trump Organization in 2007 . Cohen s dealings at the Trump family business cover a broad sweep of its global empire - including several projects that have caught the attention of federal investigators . Cohen played an integral role in early discussions about a possible Trump Tower in Moscow -- negotiations that were going on during the early months of the 2016 presidential campaign . ( MORE : Michael Cohen hints at possible cooperation with investigators ) That deal never reached fruition . Cohen has confirmed he attended a lunch meeting with a Ukrainian politician one week after Trump took office , where the two men discussed the potential for Cohen to share a Ukraine peace proposal with his contacts at the White House . And Cohen s name appeared repeatedly in the now infamous dossier of unverified allegations , which included salacious claims about Trump , prepared by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele . The agent , who was hired by an opposition research firm that was paid initially by Republicans and later by Democrats , alleged Cohen s involvement in attempting to covering up contacts between Russian operatives and members of Trump campaign . Cohen has fiercely denied the claims . In January , he tweeted : Enough is enough of the #fake #RussianDossier . Since entering his guilty pleas last month , friends of Cohen say that he has felt isolated . He is unemployable , facing an avalanche of debt and the possibility of spending several years in federal prison . With a net worth at one time of several million dollars , Cohen recently launched an online GoFundMe fundraising effort to help pay his mounting legal fees . He is scheduled to be sentenced in New York federal court on December 12 . A spokesman for Office of the special counsel declined to comment on this story . An attorney for Cohen could not immediately be reached .",

		"paragraph": "It 's natural to assume that your living expenses will go down in retirement . After all , you 'll no longer have to bear the expense of commuting to work , and there 's a good chance that by that point , you 'll have paid off your mortgage . But surprisingly enough , close to 50 % of seniors end up spending more money , not less , during their first two years of retirement than they did while working full time , and for 33 % of retirees , this trend continues for a total of six years . It therefore never hurts to have an additional means of generating income during retirement in case your savings and Social Security benefits do n't wind up cutting it . And that 's where a job can come in handy . IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . Surprisingly , though , only 15 % of retirees rely on a side job as a source of income , according to GOBankingRates . And if you 're not one of them , you could be missing out on a key opportunity to make your expenses more manageable later in life . Many seniors do n't want to work in any capacity once their full-time careers end . And that logic makes sense . After all , is n't the point of retirement to break free from the daily grind and enjoy life without being held back by job-related constraints ? Unfortunately , that idyllic picture does n't always mesh with reality . The fact of the matter is that more than 25 million seniors live at or below the poverty line , and much of that boils down to inadequate savings and an overreliance on Social Security . If working in some capacity is what it takes to prevent you from joining their ranks , then it certainly pays to go that route . That said , the work you do in retirement does n't have to be painful or boring . You might associate part-time work with stocking shelves at the supermarket or manning the cash register at a retail shop , but in reality , there are loads of more engaging , fulfilling options you can pursue . You might , for example , start your own business or turn a hobby you enjoy into a money-making opportunity ( think gardening , quilting , baking , or photography , just to name a few ) . You might even look into consulting in your former field , especially if you have a lot of contacts who can hook you up with work opportunities . Best of all , the work you do in retirement does n't have to eat up a huge chunk of your time . Imagine you 're willing to put in 10 hours a week and earn $ 20 an hour . That 's an extra $ 10,000 you 'll take in over the course of a year , which can no doubt buy you some breathing room . Furthermore , remember that working part-time in retirement can help you avoid spending money by keeping you busy , thereby helping your finances as well . If you 're having a hard time making ends meet in retirement , it pays to explore your options for working on a part-time basis . And if you 're not yet retired , start thinking about the sort of work you might enjoy once your primary career comes to an end . If you lay the groundwork for a meaningful gig in retirement ahead of time , you 'll avoid an income gap that could hurt your finances and mar your golden years with stress .

The now former Baylor president and chancellor has been making the media rounds this week to defend the school ( and himself , it seems ) in light of the scandal that has exposed the school s completely inadequate responses to allegations of sexual assault . Starr already looked , as Dan Wetzel put it , clumsy and clueless in an interview with ESPN earlier this week . He took clumsy and clueless to new levels in an interview with KWTX in Waco . Reporter Julie Hays presented Starr with a Nov. 2015 email from a woman who says she was raped by former Baylor football player Tevin Elliott , who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for a separate sexual assault . The email , which was addressed to Starr , former head coach Art Briles and others , featured the subject line I Was Raped at Baylor , and was featured in a recent episode of ESPN s Outside the Lines . When Hays asks Starr about the email , Starr at first says he may have seen it . I honestly may have . I m not denying that I saw it , Starr said . Soon after these words left Starr s mouth , KWTX s report says a public relations woman named Merrie Spaeth asked the station s news director not to use Starr s comment when the piece airs . The news director , of course , objected to that request . Spaeth then interrupts the interview to pull Starr out of the room , presumably to coach him up with a different , more image-friendly way of answering Hays question . When Starr returns to the room , Spaeth instructs Hays to ask the question a second time . She does . This time , Starr s answer is different : All I m going to say is I honestly have no recollection of that . At this point , Starr inexplicably turns to Spaeth to ask her if his answer was OK . The cameras are still rolling , and a clearly exasperated Spaeth instructs Starr to look at Hays , not at her . Starr later answered a third time . I honestly have no recollection of seeing such an email and I believe that I would remember seeing such an email , Starr said . The president of a university gets lots of emails . I do n t even see a lot of the emails that come into the office of the president . I have no recollection . None . Starr was removed as school president last week when Baylor s Board of Regents released the summary findings from Philadelphia-based law firm Pepper Hamilton s investigation into the school s handlings of sexual assault allegations . However , Starr , at first , was allowed to remain in the role of chancellor . That changed Wednesday when he announced in his ESPN interview that he would step down from that role as a matter of conscience . [ Check out Dr. Saturday on Tumblr for entertaining things you wo n t see on the blog ] Starr , who claimed he has not been privy to the full Pepper Hamilton report , did not present himself very well in that interview either . When asked if Baylor did enough to keep female students safe , Starr bizarrely made a distinction between safety on campus and off-campus . \" In terms of our campus , as far as I know , absolutely , \" Starr said . \" The episodes of which I m aware and I m behind a veil of ignorance in part , I ve been partially briefed but not fully briefed every episode of which I m aware happened off campus , not on campus . But we accept responsibility for that . We do n t say well you re not within the geographic confines . You re not in one of our residence halls . \" I do n t believe this is my belief that there is any episode of on campus . And this is part of training . We need to train our young people . Be careful . And we are using a wonderful method called green dot of bystander intervention . We ve been working on these for many many months but it s been a work in progress just as it has been around the nation . \" You can not turn as a fellow student at a party and we re an alcohol free campus it s not happening on campus to the best of my knowledge . They 're off-campus parties , those are the venues where these bad things have happened . \" In its summary of the findings from the Pepper Hamilton report , the Baylor Board said the school s student conduct processes were wholly inadequate to consistently provide a prompt and equitable response under Title IX . It also said Baylor failed to consistently support complainants and failed to take action to identify and eliminate a potential hostile environment , prevent its recurrence or address its effects . [ Visit Dr. Saturday on Facebook for stories you might have missed and chat with the writers ] Pepper Hamilton also pointed to failings from the athletic department and football program specifically . As a result , Art Briles was removed from his position as head coach and athletic director Ian McCaw resigned . Perhaps until the full Pepper Hamilton report is released not just a 13-page summary from Baylor s board will we know the full scope of what school and athletics administrators did and did not know of the multiple accusations of assaults against football players . If this interview gaffe from Starr is any indication , the details wo n't be pretty .

		"paragraph": "Even before Netflix s latest Marvel-derived series , Iron Fist , premiered to largely withering reviews ( Yahoo TV s own Ken Tucker suggested binge-watchers spend those 13 hours revisiting classic Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes instead ) , the show was already taking its lumps in the press . At issue was the decision to cast Game of Thrones star Finn Jones as martial arts master Danny Rand a character who has always been Caucasian in the comics , but who many hoped would receive a revised origin story that would better reflect the diversity of modern-day fandom . In fact , Vulture recently reported that Asian-American actor Lewis Tan very nearly landed the role before Jones was ultimately chosen . ( Tan does have a one-shot appearance in the show s eighth episode , using a Drunken Master-inspired fighting style against Danny s iron fist . ) One defender of the status quo is Iron Fist co-creator Roy Thomas , who teamed up with artist Gil Kane to craft Danny s first adventures in the pages of Marvel Comics in the mid - 70s . Speaking with Inverse recently , Thomas expressed little patience with the whitewashing complaints that have dogged the show from its production to release . I understand where it s coming from , he adds . You know , cultural appropriation , my God . It s just an adventure story . Do n t these people have something better to do than to worry about the fact that Iron Fist is n t Oriental , or whatever word ? I know Oriental is n t the right word now , either . He was a character for a comic book at a different time . â€¦ He was n t intended to stand for any race . He was just a man who was indoctrinated into a certain thing . It seems that at least one star of Iron Fist is upset with the terminology used by Thomas . Jessica Henwick , who plays Colleen Wing in the series , took to Twitter Tuesday afternoon to say : Oriental is a term used to describe rugs , not people . Speaking with Yahoo TV earlier this year before Iron Fist â€˜ s March 17 premiere , showrunner Scott Buck told us that he had n t been aware of any larger debates surrounding the character before signing onto the series . When [ Marvel Television executive vice president ] Jeph Loeb pitched me the show , it was about this billionaire kid who is torn between two worlds , Buck explains . I only heard about the [ controversy ] afterwards , but not during the process . Finn was one of the very first people we saw , and we knew we had our guy . I absolutely understand the concerns of cultural appropriation , and it s certainly something we tried not to do . Hopefully nobody is offended by what we have done I hope they will see it and judge it by itself . â€˜ Iron Fist is currently streaming on Netflix .",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for episode 6 of The Bachelorette contains spoilers . Part 2 , rose lovers ! When last we left our Bachelorette , she was thinking about some stuff in the middle of the Norweigan wilderness , while producers had Kenny and Lee penned together in the Holding Area . The former has just learned that the latter accused him of being violent , and Kenny is not happy . Oh my God , snake , he says . Look , we ai n t got to never talk , but here s what I ve got to say to you : It must feel terrible that you have to lie so terribly . You told this woman that I pulled you out of a van ? Lee , that the manipulative asshat that he is , completely denies making the van claim . You re calling her a liar now ? marvels Kenny . Let me explain something to you : If I had ever been physical with you , you would bear the scars . And that s all I ve got to say to you , declares Kenny firmly . But Lee goads him again with a sarcastic , Jesus loves you , and that sets the wrestler off on another expletive-filled tirade . Finally , Rachel returns to put all of us out of our misery . Today has been really informative , she begins . What s been very apparent today is that you guys have two completely different stories about things that have gone down . And it just comes down to who I believe and who I trust at this point . To all of Bachelor Nation s relief , that person is â€¦ wait , no one ? Rachel tells Lee she does n t trust him and is sending him home post haste , but the Bachelorette is n t ready to make a call on Kenny . I d like to spend more time with you tonight to figure that out , she explains . Naturally , Lee ca n t leave without getting in one final jab . That s okay , sweetheart , he purrs . I just want you to know , when he came back over here , he threatened me â€¦ Fortunately , Rachel shuts things down before they can escalate further . I hope you find what you re looking for , she tells Lee . I m glad you hope the same for me . The Bachelorette offers Lee a quick hug , and then heads for the helicopter with Kenny . And Kenny , secure in his victory , decides to put the whole mess behind him and focus on making things right with Rachel . Oh , wait , actually the opposite of that happened . Yes , Kenny GOES BACK TO YELL AT LEE SOME MORE , leaving Rachel waiting in the helicopter ! I am so annoyed by this , she huffs . As you should be , girl . The Bachelorette is still feeling annoyed later that night , when Kenny arrives at her hotel room for part 2 of their date . I need to figure out if Kenny is actually someone I can see as my husband . As soon as Kenny arrives , Rachel gets right to it , asking him what in the hell was thinking leaving her alone in the helicopter to go chew out Lee yet again . I m verbal , he explains . I do n t bottle things up . You let it out , in the moment , and then you forget about it . ( Okay , Kenny , but had n t you already let it out on Lee multiple times during the date ? ) The wrestler goes on to tell Rachel that he has a really long fuse and that he s a super supportive boyfriend , a romantic , and so on . I really want to like Kenny , but the guy has just gotten in his own way too many times for it to be a fluke . Still , Rachel seems happy with what Kenny has to say . One thing I do n t question is that you re here for me , she says . I do like you , and still want to see where this can go . And I think you know what happens next . Kenny s very happy to remain in the game , but there s still someone at home that he misses very much . Awwww , I ca n t help but feel bad for the guy when he breaks down in tears while FaceTiming with his daughter . And her Oh , daddy , do n t cry ! was like a punch in the gut . Hang in there , adorable family . Time for a weirdly out-of-place rose ceremony ! Robot roll call : Dean , Eric , Peter , Alex , Adam , and Matt ( wait , who ? ) join Will , Kenny and Bryan in the Circle of Safety . Which means we re saying goodbye to Anthony and , even more surprisingly , Josiah . Josiah , the guy who announced right before the ceremony , If she does n t give me a rose , there is something wrong with her brain . It is rather surprising , especially since she kept guys like Matt , who might not even be on this show , and Adam . But then again , Team Bachelorette probably asked Rachel to keep Adam one more week so they can keep doing delightfully stupid things like this : Eric , who in Monday s episode wondered if Rachel was n t interested in dating brothers , notes that two more black guys were sent home . Indeed , of the nine guys left , only three are black and that s totally fine , if it s what Rachel wants . From Oslo , we travel-by-map to Denmark . The first date goes to Eric , who s excited to have some momentum with Rachel . Am I the only one who has n t really seen a lot of chemistry between these two up until now ? Though they are cute when they dance . As they cruise through the canals on a boat tour , Rachel and Eric chit-chat about topics both little ( what they do for fun ) and big ( Rachel wants four kids , to which Eric replies , Oh , wow ! ) . Maybe it s the champagne , but I ll admit these two really do seem to be vibing ( Eric s term ) today . Of course , it s hard not to feel all warm and fuzzy in a city where strangers welcome you with open arms â€¦ and no pants . That night , Rachel takes Eric to Tivoli , the second most-visited amusement park in the world , as the Bachelorette dutifully informs us . Eric and I are like two big kids , she says happily . It s like childhood girlfriend and boyfriend having a good time . Things get more serious at dinner , when Eric explains to Rachel that growing up his mom never showed him any love and that made it hard for him to have a functional relationship as an adult . Until now , of course . I m falling for you , Eric says . I know it s right . And she LOVES it . Congrats , Eric ! You win the date rose , and the chance to avoid the next group outing , which involves hard labor . Look at Alex making it look easy ! ( Bryan , on the other hand , can barely stay upright . ) If you have n t guessed , today s date has a Viking theme , complete with costumes ! These two gentlemen have been tasked with whipping Kenny , Bryan , Alex , Dean , Matt , Peter , and Adam into tip-top Viking shape . Tom and Morton direct the guys to compete in a variety of Viking games , like steal the greased stick from the woman you want to marry and push each other out of the circle with your butt . One by one , the guys get knocked out of the running , until it s down to Kenny and Adam . To no one s surprise , Kenny succeeds in forcing Adam out of the ring but not without spilling some of his rival s blood first . Kenny s eyebrow is split open , too ( hence the shots of him with a bloody face in the previews , which Team Bachelorette wanted us to believe were the result of a knock-down drag-out fight with Lee ) . Even though he got the W ( and a nifty trophy to go with it ) , Kenny s feeling pretty insecure . There are other guys that are way further along in their emotional relationship than I am , he laments . So there s a sense of urgency . But he s gon na have to get behind Bryan , who pulls Rachel aside for another of his weirdly intense talk-and-stare sessions . Bryan s not worried that he and Rachel live in two different states he just keeps saying he s ready . To â€¦ move , maybe ? Unclear . Then Rachel lowers her voice to a whisper and asks the most serious question of the night : Absolutely , says Bryan . My family is very open . Anybody that loves me , they re gon na love 1,000 percent . ( I ll take Things Lee Would Never Say for $ 800 , Alex. ) Meanwhile , back at the hotel , Will who has the final one-on-one date of the week is talking to Eric about his past dating life . I ll be straight up with it I typically date white girls , admits Will with a grin . It s not that I do n t date black girls , I have . It s just that growing up where I grew up , especially in high school , there were n t a lot of black girls in my high school . And in college there were even fewer . There s nothing particularly profound about this conversation , but the fact that it s happening is definitely notable especially since it s happening on a show that has failed to embrace diversity for years . Hooray for baby steps ! The group date is chugging along nicely , and Rachel seems to be enjoying her time with all the guys though it s clear , as she says , that some relationships are just moving at a faster pace , and are just stronger . Which is probably why when Rachel sits down with Matt ( who ? ) , the first thing she does is ask about another guy : Kenny . It seems the wrestler is feeling pretty blue , missing his daughter and wondering if being away from her for so long is really going to be worth it . I m not necessarily 100 percent comfortable with where we at , Kenny tells Rachel . I just do n t necessarily know if our relationship has grown in the ways I would have liked it to grow . In other words , hometown dates are just a few weeks away , and Kenny s worried about bringing Rachel home to meet Mackenzie , because he does n t want his daughter to get attached and then get hurt . Rachel , being a decent human being , knows how important it is not to waste Kenny s time , and so in the interest of keeping it absolutely 100 , she gently cuts Kenny loose . And honestly , it seems like he s relieved to go , because he knows he was never going to be Rachel s last man standing . But Kenny has no hard feelings . This is a bittersweet end , he says . If Mackenzie grew up to be like Rachel , then I know that I did my job . Look at the love on Kenny s face as he talks to his daughter : Godspeed , Kenny . And do n t you dare show up on Paradise . The next day , Rachel meets Will on the shores of Helsing r , Denmark , where she hopes to help Will break out of his shell . They hop a ferry to Sweden , where they play Kubb with some fellow tourists , sample the local cuisine , and chat with a friendly older couple that producers recruited for the occasion . This delightful twosome met on the dance floor , and they ve been married for 35 years . Just too cute . See , that s what I want , Rachel sighs . 35 years . But it s unlikely she s going to spend even 3 to 5 more days with Will , because there s something missing between us . For one thing , the Bachelorette is extremely dismayed that Will has n t kissed her yet . She s given him so many opportunities , too . Stop talking about the view and kiss her already , you fool ! We are standing on top of a castle looking out over the sea , laments Rachel , and there s still nothing . I do n t know what s holding Will back . OK , buddy , dinner is your last chance . You better plant one on the Bachelorette or you ll be headed back to the States alone on the Reject Plane . The conversation is mildly intense : Will talks about mostly dating white girls because that s the pool that I was kind of working with , and Rachel notes that she grew up in a predominantly white area too , but she still mostly dated black guys . Is she annoyed at Will s admission ? Hard to say . But I do n t think it s helping his case . Also not helping ? The fact that Will says he s always been a very passionate person in his past relationships , and very focused on physical intimacy . As you might imagine , this does not make Rachel feel great . That was disappointing , she says . I have n t gotten any of that from Will today . And so â€¦ Like Rachel s break-up with Kenny , her goodbye to Will was on remarkably good terms . I think you re right . I think that I focused maybe too much on building a friendship , and not realizing that I needed to work more on the relationship , says Will . And that s on me . Goodbye , Will ! You , too , should definitely stay away from Paradise . Holy crap , rose lovers we re getting two rose ceremonies in one episode ? It s like Christmas in June ! For Rachel , it s a much less festive occasion , and she arrives at the ceremony looking and feeling solemn , as Harrison says . She s so sad , in fact , that she ca n t get through her pre-ceremony pep talk without getting tearing up and because she does n t want the men to see her cry , Rachel excuses herself and abruptly walks out . Hey buddy , get out of the shot ! Having collected herself , Rachel returns and gives out the four roses up for grabs : Bryan , Matt ( seriously ? ) , Dean , and Adam ( along with date-rose winners Eric and Peter ) will continue on this journey to find love . Unfortunately that means we have to say goodbye to the big hunk of Russian-speaking man-meat known as Alex. He handles it with a good-natured smile , the way he seems to handle most things . You know what , Alex ? You should go to Paradise . I feel like you and Jorge would get along . And that s a wrap on the EPIC , TWO-NIGHT BACHELORETTE EVENT , rose lovers . Let me know what you think : Were you surprised Kenny went home ? Who will you miss more Alex , Kenny , or Josiah ? And for the love of God , who is Matt ? Post your thoughts now ! And be sure to check out Chris Harrison s behind-the-scenes blog right here . Now if you ll excuse me , I m going to pour one ( GIF ) out for Alex : The Bachelorette airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC .

		"paragraph": "Zach Galifianakis specializes in a comedy of discomfort , with a deadpan expression followed , at unpredictable moments , by explosions of absurdity or volcanic temper . It s a strategy that makes him a surprising performer , as long as you re not looking for a steady stream of punchlines and laughs from a man who is as frequently a performance-artist as he is a comedian . All of which is to say that Baskets , the new half-hour premiering on FX on Thursday , ai n t very funny . Galifianakis stars as Chip Baskets , a sad-sack who studied to be a classically-trained clown in France , but who returns home to Bakersfield , California , only to find the only job available for him is as a rodeo clown . The French woman he adores , marries , and brings to America ( she s played by Sabina Sciubba of the Brazilian Girls ) is merely using him for a green card she leaves him as soon as they hit U.S. soil . Indigent , sore from being gored by bulls , and depressed , Chip moves in with his mother . She is played with Baskets one true flash of inspiration by Louie Anderson . Anderson inhabits Christine Baskets with a wonderful , tart delicacy . As the show-biz saying goes , he plays the character , not the clothes , and he s truly funny wringing laughs from mirthless lines on the pure strength of his delivery . But back to Chip and Dale : Galifianakis takes on the dual role of an obnoxious twin brother . Chip is most often paired with Martha , a perpetually worried-looking insurance adjuster played with impeccably quiet intensity by stand-up comic Martha Kelly . The biggest problem with Baskets , which Galifianakis co-created with Louis C.K. ( another practitioner of grimace-humor ) and writer-director-producer Jonathan Krisell , is that Chip loses our sympathy quickly by being so unnecessarily rude , even cruel , to Martha ( who s only trying to help him ) and to most of the Bakersfield citizens he encounters . When Chip says to Martha , in the fourth episode , Your whole life s a goof , he does it with such sneering dismissiveness that it carries a hurtful sting . Enough of a sting to inflict pain in a viewer as well . Instead of being a classic clown one whose misfortunes are borne aloft by lighter laughs , and an implicit invitation to identify with his troubles Chip Baskets is most often a selfish creep . It s a brave move for a performer to make , and congratulations to Galifianakis for his commitment . Just do n t ask me to keep watching him in this role I ve already used up a year s - worth of wincing . Baskets airs on Thursdays at 10 p.m. on FX .",

		"paragraph": "Ohio State coach Urban Meyer and athletic director Gene Smith had both been suspended . For Meyer , two more weeks , this time without pay , and then three full games . For Smith , it was more than two weeks in September without pay . It all stemmed from a failure to properly report to the compliance department allegations in 2015 that assistant coach Zach Smith had abused his wife . Meyer knew it was n t the first time , although he never shared that with his boss , which all alone could ve been ground for his firing . More troubling , the fresh allegations in 2015 were backed up by photos and believed by no less than Shelley Meyer , Urban s wife . Still the AD and the coach waited to see what the cops discovered . When Zach Smith was n t charged , they did and said nothing . Zach Smith stayed employed until last month when he was hit with a restraining order and a trespass charge â€¦ and the media reported on it . Now here was a tense Wednesday night news conference after an exhausting day . There were nearly 12 hours of deliberation by the school s Board of Trustees that left the state of Ohio and the world of college football on edge . Would Meyer be fired ? Would Meyer be exonerated ? In the end it was something in the middle , sure to please no one . So first Gene Smith spoke and twice he apologized to Buckeye Nation , a marketing term for Ohio State fans who apparently have been put out by all of this . Then Meyer got up and did the same . I want to apologize to Buckeye Nation , Meyer said . Yes , those poor , poor fans . You know who was n t granted an apology by these two ? Courtney Smith and her two young children , the ones she alleges hung onto her hips and screamed as her husband banged her into a wall in their apartment . No apologies for not doing more to get her out of the situation . No apologies for not taking her allegations more seriously . No apologies for enabling her husband through the years despite warning signs everywhere . No apologies for failing to , at the very least , get her and her family the help they needed , whatever that help might entail . Only one person was potentially wounded here , only one person had photos of being beaten , bloodied and bruised , only one person and two children were fully humiliated and terrorized by this entire sordid deal . And it sure was n t some season-ticket holder on the 40-yard line . Meyer kept talking about how he did n t do enough , did n t look hard enough . Maybe the reason was right there in the omission of his words . He expressed concern for himself and the community and the fans but not the heart of the issue , a domestic situation that , at the very least , was toxic and troubled beyond hope . Maybe because his attention never appeared to be on the woman and children caught in the middle of it . There were red flags , Meyer said . I wish I had known . I wish I had done a better job of finding out . I wish I was told more things . I wish I had done more , Meyer said . I wish I had known more . I needed to show more care and concern for the situation , Meyer said . I am sorry for that . Ohio State felt Meyer did enough to keep his job . That was always going to be a tough call . He told his boss at least some of what he knew . He s also won a lot of football games . That was enough . Perhaps most puzzling , though , was that in 2015 , when Gene Smith first heard of allegations against Zach Smith and discussed it with Urban Meyer , Meyer never mentioned that Zach Smith was also accused of the same crime in 2009 , when he worked for Meyer at the University of Florida . How does that not come up ? How does Meyer keep that from his boss and yet the school is cool with it ? If Meyer mentioned the 2009 allegation in 2015 , does Zach Smith stay employed ? Would n t that have altered Gene Smith s actions and eliminated his patience with the situation ? One time is one thing , horrible and chilling enough . A second time ? Ohio State is clearly fine with that , though . That s the school s decision . Meyer , for his part , clearly did n t believe he should ve even been suspended . When asked if he accepted the punishment , he merely stated , twice , I trust and support our president . He looked miserable and distracted and angry . His true feelings were clear : he d been wronged here . And that s the lingering problem . The punishment is the punishment . He ll coach again . He ll win again . He ll be lauded with standing ovations and millions in salary . Yet there is no indication Meyer is really better for this , more aware of the blind spots that got him here . Meyer acknowledged I followed my heart , not my head . I fell short of pursuing full information , because at each juncture I gave Zach Smith the benefit of the doubt . He blamed that on Zach being the grandson of former Ohio State coach Earl Bruce , who was my mentor and like a father to me . That might be part of it . It likely is n t all of it though . Finally a reporter asked Urban Meyer directly . If no one in scarlet and gray was going to speak the name of the woman who repeatedly accused Zach Smith of abuse , then the coach would be asked directly . What message do you have for Courtney Smith ? Well , my message for everyone involved in this is I m sorry we re in this situation , Meyer said . And I m just sorry we re in this situation . We re â€¦ ? No empathy . No words to the kids . No chance to pivot to the topic of domestic abuse . No criticism of Zach . No acknowledgement that no matter how messy these allegations always are , he failed that family most of all . Instead it was â€¦ we . Courtney and Urban . Mostly Urban though . Look how tough this situation is â€¦ for him . And all of Buckeye Nation , of course . Everyone s a victim at Ohio State , apparently . Everyone but the woman and her children who might have actually been abused , which is probably how everyone got here in the first place .

		"paragraph": "Sears Holdings Corp ( Nasdaq : SHLD ) announced on Thursday that it will be making yet another round of store closings as it continues its uphill battle to demonstrate a path to long-term viability . Unfortunately , the plan for a leaner , more efficient Sears has n't worked up to this point , and analysts see little reason to suspect closing more stores will change Sears ' fate . After announcing 100 store closures in January and another 100 closures in May , Sears said on Thursday that it will close 46 additional Sears and Kmart stores in November . As of May , Sears said it was operating 894 total stores , down from more than 3,300 stores in 2006 . [ See : 7 of the Worst Stocks to Buy for 2018 . ] \" We continue to evaluate our network of stores , which is a critical component to our integrated retail transformation , and will make further adjustments as needed , \" Sears says in a statement . Even after aggressively closing its least profitable stores and selling off assets , Sears ' same-store sales continue to drop precipitously . In the most recent quarter , Sears reported an 11.3 percent decline in same-store sales and a $ 424 million net loss . Sears has now racked up more than $ 11 billion in losses since 2012 . CEO Eddie Lampert has been keeping Sears afloat by using his hedge fund ESL to buy up $ 2.4 billion of Sears debt , but some analysts are questioning Lampert 's motives . \" My conclusion is he 's trying to take the whole thing for himself , \" Susquehanna analyst Bill Dreher says . Dreher says Lampert is now well-positioned to acquire some or all of Sears ' prime assets in the event of a bankruptcy . In the meantime , Susquehanna estimates ESL will continue to earn more than $ 200 million per year in interest payments from Sears . In June , Sears consolidated three large loans that were due this year and said it now has until July 20 , 2020 to pay back the $ 593 million in debt . SHLD stock is down another 67.6 percent year-to-date and is now dangerously close to the $ 1-per-share minimum listing price for stocks traded on the Nasdaq . [ See : 8 Do 's and Do n'ts During Market Volatility . ] Dreher says Sears is simply overmatched at this point . \" The environment for Sears is only going to get more competitive as other larger , more profitable retailers get a boost from lower tax rates and reinvest in their business , which Sears would not be able to do , \" he says .

		"paragraph": "Universal Display ( NASDAQ : OLED ) holds itself out as an \" innovator and enabler \" of a type of display technology known as organic light emitting diodes , or OLEDs . The company profits from such displays in two ways . First , it licenses critical intellectual property that 's required to manufacture such displays , claiming that it has over 4,500 \" pending and issued patents worldwide . \" The company receives both licensing fees as well as ongoing royalty payments for the use of its intellectual property portfolio . Image source : Apple . Beyond licensing out intellectual property , Universal Display also sells materials that are used to manufacture those displays . In 2017 , Universal Display generated $ 126.5 million in \" royalty and license \" revenue and $ 198.7 million in revenue from emitter materials used to build OLED displays . Generally speaking , the more widely OLED-based displays are adopted , the more Universal Display stands to profit . One market where OLED displays are becoming increasingly popular is the premium smartphone market . Last year , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) adopted OLED display technology on its flagship iPhone X . That likely led to a spike in demand for OLED displays , since Apple ships more premium smartphones than any other smartphone maker . This fall , Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones , two of which are expected to incorporate OLED displays . The third , a lower-cost model , is expected to incorporate a more traditional liquid crystal display . That sounds like good news for general industry-wide OLED adoption and , by extension , for Universal Display , right ? While Apple 's apparent increased proliferation of OLED displays across its iPhone product stack sounds like a positive , a recent report from The Wall Street Journal was a clear negative . The Wall Street Journal said in a June 15 report that Apple \" expects LCD models to make up the majority of iPhone sales in its lineup to be released this fall . \" \" Industry executives with direct knowledge of production plans said Apple initially wanted roughly equal production of the two screen types , \" The Wall Street Journal reported . \" Now , they say , Apple plans to make more of the LCD model , anticipating that customers would lean toward the cheaper model . \" Apple 's shift in production plans is a clear negative for Universal Display because lower industry-wide OLED display shipments could mean lower royalty revenues as well as lower sales of emitter materials . Moreover , Apple is widely viewed as a trend-setter in the smartphone market . If Apple 's most popular iPhone during the coming iPhone product cycle is a model with an LCD , then that could mean less pressure on the part of Apple 's competitors to more broadly proliferate OLED display technology across their own lineups to keep up . Over the longer term -- perhaps within a product cycle or two -- I could see Apple adopting OLED displays more broadly across its iPhone lineup if it can get the costs in check . LCDs are still cheaper to produce because the technology is more mature and there are more suppliers of mobile LCDs than of mobile OLEDs . Such broader adoption would be a boon for Universal Display and could help fuel revenue and profit growth . However , what might be a bit troubling for shareholders with even longer-term time horizons is that Apple is reportedly working hard on trying to commercialize an emerging display technology called MicroLED . MicroLED promises all of the advantages of OLED , but with even greater benefits in terms of brightness and pixel speed . Bloomberg reported in March that Apple intended to bring MicroLED technology to the Apple Watch first and then bring it to the iPhone at some point down the line . Though the report said that it 's \" unlikely that the technology will reach an iPhone for at least three to five years . \" Until Apple ( and presumably the rest of the industry ) is able to transition to MicroLED for premium smartphones , Universal Display could be poised to enjoy revenue growth from the increased adoption of OLED displays in such phones . However , if MicroLED does ultimately displace OLED in premium smartphones , then Universal Display 's prospects could be fairly dim . More From The Motley Fool Ashraf Eassa has no position in any of the stocks mentioned . The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Universal Display . The Motley Fool has the following options : long January 2020 $ 150 calls on Apple and short January 2020 $ 155 calls on Apple . The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .",

		"paragraph": "Black-ish , now in its second season , has become the most socially-conscious network sitcom on the air , as well as one of the funniest . Built around the Johnson family advertising exec Dre ( Anthony Anderson ) , doctor Bow ( Tracee Ellis Ross ) , their four children and Dre s live-in parents this is an upper-middle-class Los Angeles clan that , week to week , grapples with the usual sitcom concerns of anxious parenthood and troublesome child-rearing . But in even the most innocuous plots , black-ish finds a way to remind you that this is a specifically black family dealing with everyday events that often yield up race-related issues . On Wednesday night , black-ish will drop the pretense of a comic plot to address as directly as possible the subject of police brutality toward black citizens in a remarkable episode titled Hope . It is structured around the way the entire family including Dre s father ( Laurence Fishburne s Pops ) and mother ( Jenifer Lewis Ruby ) reacts to ongoing cable-news coverage of the impending announcement of an indictment of a white police officer for the alleged mistreatment of a black youth . ( CNN s Don Lemon is seen on-screen doing the play-by-play coverage . ) Commencing with the music of Marvin Gaye s What s Going On and pictures of real-life tragic figures such as Trayvon Martin , this black-ish written by series creator Kenya Barris offers a tough , frank enactment of dialogues and arguments that occur among black families around such firestorm issues . As the assembled cast watches the TV reports , Pop explodes right at the top of the show , The police are damn thugs ! Dre adds sarcastically that only 92 percent of them are thugs the other eight percent are advisors on Law & Order . Dre is a complex variation on the bumbling TV dad , one whose pride in making a good living and providing for his family is undercut by the often higher wisdom of his equally hard-working wife , his scolding parents , and his skeptical kids . At work , Dre is frequently the only black guy in the room , and thus subject to condescension or obsequious flattery in efforts by his white co-workers to get the black man s point of view on anything from current events to the best way to pitch the urban consumer . This week s episode reminds us of the frustration simmering just beneath the surface of Dre s genial exterior . The half-hour places a Dre who sides with his Pops in taking a dim view of authority figures , versus the idealism of Bow and his children . The unofficial guest star on black-ish this week is the essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates : Junior ( Marcus Scribner ) invokes him , having read Coates s best-selling book Between the World and Me , and Coates s image appears briefly on the family s TV set , as a guest invited to comment on the pending indictment . Dre is miffed that Junior does n t realize that much of what he quotes from Coates are sentiments he himself has said about the condition of being black in America . It s at once a joke that silly sitcom dad , trying to puff himself up ! and a serious observation : that one reason Coates s writing strikes a chord is that it is often a finely articulated version of what many black people do say , mostly to each other . Barris s script links Coates to earlier writers including Malcolm X and Alex Haley ( funny flashback to an Afro d Dre lecturing his father while quoting Malcolm s autobiography ) , and James Baldwin ( Who s he ? asks Junior , heartbreakingly ) . One thing black-ish does superbly is remind its mass audience of the wide range of opinions there are that being black does not mean hewing to a party-line . In this , the show has always done a wonderful job of contrasting Bow Rainbow , the progeny of 1960s idealist hippies , blessed and trained with a mind for science with Dre s parents , old-school working-class blacks who operate from a position of hard-won pragmatism . That contrast gets full play tonight . The episode builds to a conclusion that binds its title , Hope , to the initial promise of the Obama presidency , and then undercuts it with a despairing realism . All this , plus super-good jokes name-checking Spike Lee s Chi-Raq , The Black Panthers , O.J. Simpson , and Peabo Bryson ( look him up , kids ) . Make sure not to miss Hope . Black-ish airs Wednesday nights at 9:30 p.m. on ABC .",

		"paragraph": "A New Jersey high school has retracted a threat banning students from prom , for participating in organized walk-outs in response to the Florida school shooting . Principal Dennis Perry of Cherry Hill High School East explained the changeabout in a February 27th letter to the school , even inviting students to participate in an organized walk on March 14th , the same day as the national school walkout planned by The Women s March s Youth EMPOWER group . Perry also announced a weekly meeting between students and teachers to discuss school safety and a letter campaign to victims of the February 14th shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , among other initiatives . I am formally retracting the statement that I made on Monday , February 26 , regarding withholding participation in the senior trip , the senior prom , or graduation for participating in the disruption planned for that morning , wrote Perry . One day prior , Perry made the controversial announcement in the midst of a student protest in support of teacher Timothy Locke , who was reportedly placed on administrative leave after expressing concern about Cherry Hill s lack of armed officers and comparing the school to Columbine High School , where in 1999 , two students killed 13 people in a mass shooting . A student also told Philly.com that Locke said , The chances of East being shot up were high . And Locke himself told the website that his bag was searched and he was ordered to undergo a physical and a psychiatric evaluation . In an audio obtained by PhillyVoice , Perry said , I am assuming that the purpose of the planned disruption was out of frustration because it was felt as though you were not being heard . Well , I do want you to have that opportunity to be heard , and I do want to hear you . He added , Please know that those of you who opt into some sort of civil disobedience will be immediately suspended and you will lose your senior trip and prom if you are in 12th grade . Perry did not answer Yahoo Lifestyle s multiple requests for comment . According to Edward Barocas , legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , threatening to punish student activists is , in many cases , unconstitutional . Schools can not punish kids for skipping class to protest any more harshly than they would for skipping for another reason , he tells Yahoo Lifestyle . It would be unconstitutional to focus on the reasons for missing class . Threatening to ban protesters from prom violates two rights , says Barocas : The right to due process , which in this case , requires fair and transparent discipline procedures for an offense not eleventh-hour bans and the right to free speech . Aside from the March 14 walkout , a March for Our Lives walk in Washington , D.C. is scheduled for March 24th , and a National School Walkout , on April 20th on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting . Cherry Hill is one of several schools to threaten protesting students with discipline . According to local news station KHOU , a district in Spring , Texas issued a statement that students who participate in walk-outs face in-school suspension , even while investigating a February 23rd threat to one its own high schools . The Needville Independent School District , also in Texas , stated in a now-deleted Facebook post , Should students choose to [ walk out ] , they will be suspended from school for three days and face all the consequences that come along with an out-of-school suspension â€¦ We will discipline no matter if it is one , fifty or five hundred students involved . The good news is , student activism does n t seem to be a deal breaker for many prospective colleges . Hannah Mendlowitz , senior assistant director of admissions at Yale penned a February 23rd post which read , Does Yale look unfavorably upon discipline resulting from peaceful demonstrations ? The answer is simple : Of course not â€¦ I , for one , will be cheering these students on from New Haven . The MIT admissions department said in a blog post , We have already informed those who asked that , in this case , a disciplinary action associated with meaningful , peaceful participation in a protest will not negatively impact their admissions decision , because we would not view it as inappropriate or lacking integrity on its face . The University of Massachusetts Amherst assured protesting students We wo n t hold it against you . And the dean of admissions at Smith College tweeted , We ve got you on this side .

		"paragraph": "Things are getting confusing on Fox News regarding the Trump administration s severe new immigration crackdown . All of the channel s opinion-ators are obliged to support Trump no matter what . But , darn it , video and now audio of shivering , crying children separated from their parents and locked up in empty , repurposed big-box stores , some of them in cages well , it makes it tricky to keep on backing Trump with Fox s usual clarity of purpose . On Monday morning on Fox & Friends , Steve Doocy began the day as America s foremost cage-denier : While some have likened them to concentration camps or cages , Doocy said , you do see that they have those thermal blankets . â€¦ Some have referred to them as â€˜ cages , but â€¦ they built walls out of chain-link fences . Here s an idea : Then why not put your son Peter in one of them , Steve ? At noon on Monday , a brawl broke out on Fox s Outnumbered , where cracks were beginning to show in the unified front Fox News tries to maintain . While guest Jason Chaffetz defended the forced removal and imprisonment of children , the mono-named Kennedy who can usually be counted upon to toe the party line broke free , sneering sarcastically , Yeah , I m sure all these mini-rapists have bombs strapped to their chests . By Monday night , Tucker Carlson was engaging in his standard tactic , radical whataboutism , asking his audience , what about American lawbreakers who are sent to prison are n t they being separated from their children ? Yeah , man : America first ! Sean Hannity kept his priorities straight : He led off with a hard-hitting segment about â€¦ Hillary Clinton s email server . Of course . But at 10 p.m. , Laura Ingraham picked up the slack , insisting that the nationwide protests against the Trump policy was just faux liberal outrage . Ingraham also said the child cages are essentially summer camps [ or ] boarding schools . She had Attorney General Jeff Sessions on so he could refute the accusation that his kid detention centers are comparable to concentration camps . This is the best he could come up with : Well , it s a big exaggeration : In Nazi Germany , they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country . ( UPDATE : Noting that her comment got people upset , Ingraham later doubled-down on the boarding school comment , as can be seen here , saying , The San Diego Union Tribune today described the facilities as essentially like what you would expect at a boarding school . So I will stick to there are some of them like boarding schools . ) If what they re peddling were n t so appalling , you might almost feel sorry for these highly paid media stooges for child punishment : The Fox folks have to try to make sense of Trump s words , which on Monday included this illiterate gush : We have the worst immigration laws in the entire world nobody has such sad , such bad , and actually in many cases such horrible and tough . [ sic ] You see about child separation , you see what s going on there . It s obvious Trump barely understands the policies he is putting in place he s following the Stephen Miller-Steve Bannon nationalist playbook without , as usual , comprehending the implications of what he s doing . There is no such excuse for Tucker Carlson and the rest of them . They know what they re up to . Tucker Carlson Tonight , Hannity , and The Ingraham Angle air weeknights at 8 , 9 , and 10 p.m. , respectively , on Fox News . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Photos : AMC Warning : This interview contains storyline and character spoilers for The Walking Dead Season 6 . It s been an interesting summer for The Walking Dead s Michael Cudlitz , whose ginger-haired ( and bearded ) Abraham Ford had an especially eventful evolution in Season 6 , finding true love and contemplating starting a family with Sasha before , of course , joining his friends in Negan s semicircle of doom in the season finale . Abraham also continued to bring the funny in Season 6 , with his query to Glenn about whether Maggie had intentionally gotten pregnant : When you were pouring the Bisquick , were you trying to make pancakes ? The quip became one of his most quotable lines ever and spurred Cudlitz to start a series of fan-convention food drives , which have resulted in thousands of pounds of donations to food banks across the country . On the flip side , Cudlitz s appearance at several Walker Stalker Conventions since the Season 6 finale left us all hanging last April has meant he is asked hundreds of times a day who is at the business end of Negan s barbed-wire bat . No worries , though â€¦ If there s anyone in The Walking Dead cast who can handle the spoiler-seekers , it s Cudlitz . The actor talked to Yahoo TV about his character s arc in Season 6 , his other favorite Abraham moments and quotes , Abraham s complicated love life and hopes for the future , his Bisquick philanthropy , and how , even after hundreds , probably thousands , of queries , he wo n t be tricked into spilling the goods about Season 7 . And , yes , he knows you think he might be Negan s victim . Yahoo TV : Abraham had so many big , funny , and dramatic moments in Season 6 . Did you feel like this was his best season ever?Michael Cudlitz : I think in Season 6 , he had the most complete arc that he s ever had . In the other seasons , I thought there were arcs , but they were arcs that only went over a couple of episodes . This was the most complete change in direction of Abraham s ship and defining moments that would push him through to where he was headed next . With his ending his relationship with Rosita , with trying to define in his own head what his relationship was or wanted to be with Sasha â€¦ Even if he could n t be with Sasha , he knew he still could not be with Rosita . Then relinquishing that almost father role , caretaker role , with Eugene , knowing that Eugene had finally grown up . That wonderful scene in the [ season finale ] , the scene where I said goodbye to Eugene and let him go , because he had finally turned into the soldier that he had always wanted to be . He was able to do something for the group that was completely outside of himself . I think it was a very , very hard moment for Abraham , but also a very proud moment , for him to see what Eugene had become . I think this show does that really well . It shows that people , generally speaking , will step up and do what they have to do when they have to do it . It s interesting what you just said about Abraham and Rosita , that even if Abraham had n t started a relationship with Sasha , even if he had n t pursued it or it had n t worked out , that he was n t going to stay with Rosita . Yeah , I think their relationship was one of convenience for both of them . I think there s a very strong love there , but it has turned into almost a familial love . He s seeing her less and less as a lover . You see that when he s lying in bed . The sex is great , he s not going to deny that , but he sees that she is so much more in love with him than he is with her . I think that hurts him because he feels that she deserves better than him . The way he broke up with Rosita seemed cold and abrupt , but was it the only way he could get through it?I think with his skill set , it was the only way he could do it . Look , he tried to say , I m leaving . It s over . She s like , Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? He just snaps because he does n t have the words . He ca n t explain it like I can explain it . It s not part of who he is . It s not in his makeup . He falls back to the only thing he can , which is , If I m really mean to her , she ll go away . It s brutal . It s horrible . It s mean . It s probably the most wrong thing he could say , but it s effective . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead EP Greg Nicotero Says Season 7 Premiere â€˜ Really Redefines Grief How long do you think Abraham has been interested in Sasha ? Is that why he got in the car with her in the Season 6 premiere , when they re Pied Pipering the walkers away from Alexandria ? Even if you go back to Season 5 , at Deanna s party , when they have that conversation , do you think his feelings go back that far?I think it sneaks up on him . I think the whole thing sneaks up on him . He may know subconsciously , but on the surface , no . There s no plan to get in the car , other than he identifies with her and thinks that he can help her . He s seen soldiers that have gone through PTSD , and he knows what she needs , when really it s the opposite . He s the one who s going through the trauma , and he actually needs her . I think that we subconsciously seek out what we need . In any event , I do not think that he was at all aware that this was what the future would hold at that point . When do you think it hit him ? During their time together in the insurance office ? Yeah . I think it was on the bridge where he realized , it hit him . He literally puts his gun down and confronts death and goes hand-to-hand with death and realizes , What am I doing ? Up until that moment , he has nothing left to live for , so he really is making reckless choices . He does not care at that point if he dies . Then what he realizes is that it does matter . He has a tremendous amount to live for . Related : Stars From â€˜ The Walking Dead , â€˜ Gotham and More Grill Each Other at Comic-Con He tells Sasha he s thinking about his future , he s going to make some moves , and he does . He breaks up with Rosita , he starts the relationship with Sasha . Do you think the next step in his mind is that he is thinking about having a family with Sasha?Absolutely . Yeah , that s the question . He does n t know how to use the big boy words all the time , but that s the question he s really trying to process when he s asking Glenn about the Bisquick . The question really is , Did Maggie get pregnant by accident or were you guys trying to get pregnant ? He needs to understand why you would try to get pregnant . I think it s because he actually thinks , I want to have kids . He needs someone to help walk him through Why do I think I want to have kids ? This is the stupidest idea I ve ever had . I m usually pretty logical about this s *** . Why the hell would you want to have kids ? I m going to go to one of the smartest people I know , who is Glenn , and I m going to ask him , ' Were you trying ? OK , so you were planning . OK , so I m not crazy . It s being confirmed because you re confirming it kinda â€¦ I m going to keep talking , because we re going to figure this out . He eventually does . It s wonderful , and it s disjointed , and it s completely nonlinear , and he s a f *** ing hot mess , Abraham . Going back to the Bisquick storyline and Abraham s instant classic Bisquick quote : You ve turned that one line into very successful food drives at fan events . Have you sparked literally tons of food donations at this point?Yes . I think we did a thousand pounds of food at the last food drive â€¦ We do them in every city now in conjunction with Walker Stalker Con . I do n t do them at every convention because with Walker Stalker Con , we have a mechanism in place where we go into the city beforehand [ and ] we find a really highly rated food bank organization , typically one that is a feeder to other , smaller food banks . They come in on the Sunday after we leave , and they scoop up everything that we have collected . I was approached on social media , where someone had said , Oh my gosh , you re going to get so much Bisquick this weekend at a convention . I thought , Oh , that s not good . I ca n t bring a lot of stuff back . What am I going to do with this ? Then I thought , Hey , you know what ? Bring it . Bring as much as you want . As a matter of fact , we re going to see if we can turn this into a food drive , ha-ha-ha . It was a joke to start off . The first weekend that we did it , it was huge . Every weekend has been bigger since . General Mills is involved . They send 300 to 400 boxes of Bisquick to every event that we do , so no matter what , the food banks in every city are going to get at least that . The fans have done a tremendous job and put in tremendous effort to more than match that . If you go on my Twitter feed , you can see all the boxes on the tables . It s just crazy . We ve opened it up to canned foods as well , not just Bisquick , any non-perishables , anything that you would find at a food bank that you could donate . The fan response has been amazing . What were some of your other favorite Abraham moments and lines from Season 6 ? I think the moment , I spoke already on this , the moment I say goodbye to Eugene . And the moment of confrontation with Eugene in the foundry . Timmy almost ate your face ? Yup . You know how to bite a dick , Eugene . [ And ] That s just the way s *** is . I love , I call it my say anything moment , when Abraham is standing out in front of Sasha s house , just standing there waiting for her to come out . I loved that moment . I love working with Sonequa [ Martin-Green ] . Any of the scenes with the women , just good . And the last scene , in the finale , in the semicircle , everyone just doing terrific work . For those two nights , on their knees , just raw . It was awesome . I m not going to ask you because I m sure you have been asked for spoilers â€¦ Baby Judith . It s Baby Judith ! But how are you handling that , the constant hunt for spoilers this summer ? Do you think anybody expects you re really going to answer that question?I do n t even think they hope that you answer it . I think in the back of their minds , they think that you re going to slip up and say who it may or may not be . I get asked probably a hundred times a day during a convention . Almost every person asks . They usually preface it with , I know you re not going to tell me , but who â€¦ Just tell me it was n t you . Or , I know who it is . I know it s Michonne . Or , Man , that s f *** ed up . Everyone s going to go crazy because Daryl is dead . They want a reaction . You go on the Interweb , and it s a tremendous amount of speculation and guesses . It s just like , No , we re not telling you anything now . Get over it . So how do you respond ? I respond differently because the question is always different in how they ask it . They ll say , Who died ? And I ll say , Everyone . They ll say , Who dies ? I ll say , Baby Judith . They ll say , I know you re dead . I ll say , OK . OK , you know . They re like , No , no , tell me who ! Guess what ? You do n t get to know , and you do n t know . Anything anyone is reporting out there is pure speculation unless they are getting information from someone who is in the cast or who is working for the company . If that s the case , then they re f *** ing a ** holes anyway . You just ruined it for people who do n t want to know .

		"paragraph": "After a busy week that saw big cap tech names send markets into the weekend with whoosh higher , this week will feature even more earnings news , a crowded economic calendar , and the long-awaited announcement from President Donald Trump on who will be nominated to lead the Federal Reserve . In an Instagram video posted late Friday , Trump said , People are anxiously awaiting my decision as to who the next head of the Fed will be . Trump added that he has somebody very specific in mind for the job who , hopefully , will do a fantastic job . Betting site PredictIt currently has current Fed governor Jerome Powell as the odds-on favorite to get the nomination , while reports last week indicated either Powell or Stanford professor John Taylor would be Trump s pick for the job . Elsewhere in markets this week we ll have another rush of earnings with 138 members of the S&P 500 reporting results , including Apple ( AAPL ) , the world s largest company , and Facebook ( FB ) . Facebook , along with Twitter ( TWTR ) and Google ( GOOGL ) , will be spending part of Wednesday on Capitol Hill answering questions from lawmakers regarding their role in potential Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election . Other notable earnings this week include Starbucks ( SBUX ) , Under Armour ( UAA ) , Pfizer ( PFE ) , MasterCard ( MA ) , MetLife ( MET ) , Yum Brands ( YUM ) , and Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A , BRK-B ) , among many others . The economic calendar also has the month s big highlight as Friday will bring markets the October jobs report . After September saw the first decline in job gains since September 2010 , economists are looking for a big bounce back in October . According to estimates from Bloomberg , Wall Street is forecasting nonfarm payroll gains of 300,000 in October with the unemployment rate set to hold steady at 4.2 % . Brett Ryan , an economist at Deutsche Bank , said in a note on Friday that he is expecting job growth to rebound to 250,000 in October due to a dissipation of hurricane effects low jobless claims during the survey week and robust supporting evidence of solid job growth from the ISM employment subcomponents . Ryan notes , however , that after Hurricane Katrina it took two months until job growth returned to its prior trend . Elsewhere on the economic calendar , we ll get data on personal income and spending , consumer confidence , inflation , and manufacturing activity . On Friday , we got two key pieces of data about the U.S. economy . We learned that in the third quarter of 2017 the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3 % , better than expected and marking the best two-quarter stretch for the economy since 2014 . Additionally , we saw that consumer confidence remains strong with the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment survey holding near its best monthly level in 13 years . In this report we also got a glimpse into the expectations around growth from U.S. consumers . And against the backdrop of an administration arguing that we need corporate tax reform to get more economic and wage growth , it seems that consumers are actually quite content with the current state of affairs . Lingering doubts about the near term strength of the national economy were dispelled as more than half of all respondents expected good times during the year ahead and anticipated the expansion to continue uninterrupted over the next five years , said Richard Curtin , chief economist for the University of Michigan survey . Consumers do not anticipate accelerating growth rates but rather a continuation of the slower pace of growth that has characterized this recovery , Curtin added . Low unemployment and low inflation rates have made lower income growth rates more acceptable . Moreover , the Great Recession has caused a fundamental change in assessments of economic risks , with consumers now giving greater preference to economic stability relative to economic growth . This is the essential reason why consumers have voiced such positive economic assessments of such a modest pace of economic growth . And so while so much of the post-crisis economic discussion has been about how the economy s growth trajectory has been slow to accelerate , it seems that consumers have simply adjusted to this new normal . Economist Matt Busigin noted Friday that the third quarter GDP report was the first since the crisis that filled the output gap , meaning that actual GDP exceeded potential GDP . The economy , then , is back to meeting whatever potential power economists estimate we can muster from existing workforce trends . And it seems that consumers are content to meet this potential against a sense of this being relatively sustainable rather than seeing growth shoot higher against a gnawing feeling that the good times might not last .

After a lot of thought , I decided that I wo n t be doing any TV interviews , too stressful & untrustworthy 4 me & my fans , she wrote . I m going to film it myself & post it on my youtube channel in the next week the entire explanation of what happened & why ! I love you all-sign up & get ready . Barr had teased on Sunday that she would participate in some sort of TV interview , but she left out the particulars . She also debuted her new hairdo . Barr did agree to a chat after the cancellation of Roseanne , but only for a podcast that s hosted by her friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach a man she met while doing her own talk show two decades ago . During that exchange , Barr tearfully expressed remorse over how her actions had been misconstrued . That s why I m trying to rectify it , because I m not that person , Barr said about the racist tweet that led to her firing . I never was , and I never will be . I never will be that person . I was trying to say that I had issues with the Obama administration on Israel and Jewish issues . On June 21 , ABC announced that it will go into production on 10 episodes of The Conners , with just about everyone from Roseanne except Barr . She will not benefit financially from the spin-off , which was described this way : After a sudden turn of events , the Conners are forced to face the daily struggles of life in Lanford in a way they never have before . This iconic family Dan , Jackie , Darlene , Becky , and D.J. grapples with parenthood , dating , an unexpected pregnancy , financial pressures , aging , and in-laws in working-class America . Through it all , the fights , the coupon cutting , the hand-me-downs , the breakdowns with love , humor , and perseverance , the family prevails . ",

		"paragraph": "There is nothing on President Trump s desk in the Oval office apart from two phones , and he can not even make them work . At his televised announcement of a trade deal with Mexico yesterday , a flunky had to intervene to press the right buttons so that Trump could talk to Enrique , the president of Mexico , on speakerphone . It was symbolic of the shambles that is Donald Trump s trade policy . He was elected on a promise to renegotiate Nafta , the North American Free Trade Agreement , the deal between the US , Mexico and Canada signed by Bill Clinton 25 years ago . This week s deal means that he has renegotiated part of it , the US-Mexico part , and has forced Chrystia Freeland , the Canadian foreign minister , to scramble to Washington to try to finalise the Canadian part . But when Trump told his supporters he would renegotiate Nafta , they did not think he meant he would negotiate a similar deal and call it something else . Yesterday the US president said : I like to call this deal the United States-Mexico trade agreement I think it s an elegant name . Mainly because it is not Nafta . Being Trump , he was quite open about what he was up to . I think Nafta has a lot of bad connotations for the United States , because it was a ripoff . At least , that was what he and the Republican Tea Party tendency told the voters it was , despite all the evidence that it had been good for the US economy . What is interesting is that all candidates running against incumbents in America condemn free trade and demand protection for American jobs , only to realise once in office that free trade is the best way to defend American jobs . Clinton was against Nafta before he was for it , and now Trump is running away from his campaign rhetoric too . Yes , he has imposed punitive tariffs on Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminium , but Mexico s retaliation ( putting tariffs on food imports from the US ) has hurt a lot of farmers , some of them part of Trump s voting base . This has forced the Trump administration to rush to design a compensation scheme , which those affected are already complaining is not enough . Trump also said he wanted a sunset clause on his I Ca n t Believe It s Not Nafta agreement after five years , but now he has agreed the new deal will last for at least 16 years . In a way , this is reassuring : Trump turns out to be a bendable politician like the rest , rather than a uniquely destructive force . The whole farce is like a Brexit morality tale : populist politicians tell the people their problems are caused by unfair trade relations with their next-door neighbours , and then have to spend the next few years trying to replicate those very same trade deals . The parallels between the Nafta negotiations and Brexit are uncanny . One problem with Nafta , from Trump s point of view , was that its disputes resolution procedures were unfair to the US and infringed its right to decide its own laws . The new Definitely Not Nafta deal keeps those procedures with minor tweaks . Both sets of talks are up against tight deadlines , which means that many of the difficult questions have been shelved for later while the existing arrangements are allowed to roll over . The reason Trump has gone ahead with Mexico and without Canada is because talks with the Canadians have stalled for two months after the row over steel tariffs , while Trump has to send the Mexico deal to Congress by Friday this week to have a chance of getting it done by the time Enrique Pena Nieto s six-year term as Mexican president ends in November . Meanwhile , the free trade that underpins the prosperity of Americans , Mexicans , Canadians and Europeans stumbles on , despite the attempts of populist politicians to wreck it .",

If he won , he could help the Steelers give running back Le Veon Bell the massive contract he s been seeking . Smith-Schuster said he bought hundreds of lottery tickets with that idea in mind . As Smith-Schuster mentioned , his plan failed . Despite purchasing all those tickets , Smith-Schuster did not walk away as the winner of the jackpot . Bell did not report to the Steelers during the team s bye week as expected . He continues to hold out for a long-term contract . Bell has yet to sign his franchise tag tender from the club . The Steelers have gone 3-2-1 without him . James Conner has produced some strong games while filling in for Bell . Through six weeks , Conner has scored seven touchdowns on 453 yards rushing . Smith-Schuster has also picked up some slack with Bell out . The sophomore wideout has hauled in 42 catches for 561 yards and two touchdowns . He has gone over 100 yards receiving in four of the team s six games this season . Just because Smith-Schuster s initial plan failed does n t mean he has to give up now .

The 55-year-old was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries after driving her Porsche into a ditch in Thousand Oaks , Calif . The Melrose Place alum acknowledged the incident on Instagram , saying she is home and good . The actress has publicly struggled with drug and alcohol issues over the years however , cops say neither appear to have played a part in the crash . TMZ reports authorities have wrapped up their investigation and Locklear wo n t face any criminal consequences . Apparently , phone records will not be pulled to see whether distracted driving was an issue because no other vehicles were involved . This is n t the Too Close to Home star s first vehicular incident . In 2010 , Locklear completed a 30-day in-patient rehab program for prescription drugs after she was cited for a misdemeanor hit and run . Locklear has been in and out of rehab over the years , seeking treatment for anxiety and depression in 2008 . In 2012 , she was hospitalized for allegedly mixing alcohol and prescription medication , and it was reported she entered rehab again at the end of 2016 . Yet the TV star has come a long way , and started 2017 off right after taking time for herself . I am feeling great and am taking steps to enrich and better my life , she said in a statement in January . Currently I am working on tying up some loose ends regarding certain issues so I can hit 2017 full steam ahead . All evidence points to the fact that she s doing just that . First off , her love life appears to be going well . She is dating her former high-school sweetheart , Chris Heisser , and judging by social media , the two are happy and enjoying their time together ( she even called him her favorite person on earth in an Instagram caption ) . The actress is also a proud mom to Ava Sambora , who is a model and student at the University of Southern California . She often shares sweet photos of the 19-year-old on Instagram . Ava is Locklear s only child with former husband Richie Sambora , and the friendly exes were photographed vacationing together over the spring break in March .

		"paragraph": "Since Game of Thrones first aired , it has faced a steady stream of criticism for depicting women as sexual objects and displaying violence against the show s female characters . Last year , the controversy reached a fever pitch when a scene portraying Sansa Stark s brutal rape inspired heated debate over the popular HBO series purported sexism , even prompting reclusive author George RR Martin to weigh in . The latest episode , however , depicted its leading female characters seizing power arguably the highest order of power demonstrated on the show to date . Also Read : ' Game of Thrones ' : Did Bran Stark Cause the Mad King 's Downfall ? The final sequences of Blood of My Blood , which aired last Sunday , could n t overstate it , positioning Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) , Cersei Lannister ( Lena Headey ) , and of course Daenerys Targaryen ( Emilia Clarke ) as the brains behind what looks to be a brewing battle in the seven kingdoms that will be led by ahem women ! One clear example of a woman usurping a man s power involves Sansa whose anger fuels her vengeful plot against tormenter and estranged husband Ramsay in a bid to win back her ancestral home . Reunited with Jon Snow and on his turf at Castle Black she clearly calls the shots in battle strategy sessions , even using her status as a full-blooded Stark to undermine his position and lead the charge . Snow is , after all , only her half brother , and therefore half Stark . Also Read : ' Game of Thrones ' : Everything Bran Stark Saw in His Flashback Montage In ' Blood of My Blood ' We ve gotten used to Daenerys being in charge , and now she s more dominant than ever , bent on conquering all of Westeros as she announced atop one of her full-grown dragons . But Sansa s rise to power is new , and shares similarities to that of Cersei , who is also guided by rage . She seizes her power through back channels , guiding her brother ( and lover ) Jamie to wage war against the High Sparrow who is in control of King s Landing and their son , King Tommen . The episode also portrayed power plays by Arya Stark ( Maisie Williams ) , fleeing the House of Black and White on an apparent revenge quest . Even the normally docile Gilly ( Hannah Murray ) revealed her strength when attacking Sam s wildling-hating father . Also Read : 15 Big ' Game of Thrones ' Fan Theories for Season 6 ( Photos ) Still , Westeros most powerful women had to face shame and humiliation before their rise to dominance . There was Sansa s aforementioned rape ( and , as she has indicated on the show , there was much more than just one sexual assault committed against her ) Cersei s nude walk of atonement and Daenerys forced confinement by the Dothrakis , who taunted her and threatened rape . As Martin said last year , Game of Thrones depicts a patriarchal society based on the Middle Ages . That era along with all of human history , really was n t known for its fairness toward women . Seeing the women of Thrones emerge is , at the very least , an example of how get a wide audience on board with a story of female empowerment .

		"paragraph": "The Oakland Raiders delivered difficult news Tuesday that former linebacker Neiron Ball is in a medically induced coma after suffering a brain aneurysm on September 16 . The 26-year-old started two games for the Raiders as a rookie in 2015 , a remarkable accomplishment after he survived a harrowing ordeal battling a rare brain condition called arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) while playing at the University of Florida . The Aneurysm and AVM Foundation spoke with Ball s family on Tuesday and released a statement on Twitter regarding his condition . Ball s brain condition first surfaced at Florida in 2011 during a football workout . What started as a dull pain in his lower neck led to Ball being hooked up to a morphine drip in the hospital where the pain was so intense , he could n t tolerate light . Ball s brother-in-law Dary Myricks described the scene to Yahoo Sports Eric Adelson . When I saw him , he was in so much pain , Myricks said . I knew they d have tubes and medicine , but he was literally screaming when we walked in . Doctors discovered bleeding on his brain and eventually diagnosed him with AVM , a condition where the brain s blood vessels get tangled and rupture . Ball eventually underwent a medical procedure to radiate the vessel , intended to create scarring that would cause the tangle vessel to clot . From Adelson s report : Cleared by doctors , Ball went on to a stunning recovery that saw him return to the football field with the Gators and eventually become a fifth-round draft pick by the Raiders in 2015 . While in Oakland , Ball befriended a 10-year-old Raiders fan who had also suffered AVM , a condition believed to affect 300,000 Americans . A knee injury , not his brain condition , eventually cut Ball s Raiders career short . The Raiders asked for the support of their fanbase as Ball is again unexpectedly dealing with the condition that he thought he had beaten . The Raiders ask that Neiron Ball and his family are kept in the thoughts and prayers of the Raider Nation during this difficult time .

		"paragraph": "Architect of Gangsta Rap . Actor in family-friendly movies . Outspoken social activist . Founder of an innovative new 3-on-3 basketball league . Ice Cube has carved out a niche in so many different sectors of the entertainment industry that it makes him a fascinating interview subject . Yahoo Sports caught up with Ice Cube this week in China as he is in the midst of negotiations to bring the Big 3 to a new market . In a wide-ranging 30-minute conversation , Ice Cube addressed how he fell in love with basketball , what it was like hearing his music on the radio the first time , his five-year vision for the Big 3 and why Los Angeles will never be a Chargers town . Yahoo Sports : I know you and your friends used to sneak into the Forum to watch Lakers games when you were a kid . Was that when you started to fall in love with the sport ? Ice Cube : I ve been in love with basketball since I was 9 , 10 years old . That s really about the same time that Magic Johnson became a Laker . When he became a Laker , I got really into it . I remember playing in my backyard wishing Magic would drive by , come back there and play with me . We could n t afford to go to the Forum for games , but my neighbor s big brother , he worked the door . He would let us walk in the turnstile without scanning a ticket . Once we got in there , we would walk around and watch or see somebody move and jump in their seats . It was just cool to see basketball at that level . The forum was not too far from my house . To know that the best team in the world was playing five miles from where you live and you re in the building smelling the popcorn and feeling that vibe , it was just magical . YS : Do you have a favorite memory as a Lakers fan ? Ice Cube : It was a game that we snuck in , it was a blowout and people were leaving . We snuck down by the floor , right by the tunnel . I remember Magic was coming out the tunnel , and I was right there . I was like , â€˜ Hey Magic ! He was like , â€˜ Hey young dude And he slapped my hand and kept going . I just remember he had the softest hands I d ever felt from a man . I was used to feeling my daddy s rough-ass hard-working calloused hands . Magic s hands were soft as a baby . [ Ice Cube on Colin Kaepernick : â€˜ I knew his message would be hijacked ] YS : The past few years have obviously been tough for the Lakers . If I made you GM for the summer , what would your strategy be ? Go after LeBron ? Try to trade for Kawhi ? Keep building around the young guys ? Ice Cube : I would see what I ve got with my young guys , but if you have superstars on the market , it would be irresponsible not to go after them . Especially if you have cap space . But I would bring in one guy at a time . I would n t bring in two superstars because it just does n t work with the Lakers from my experience . I remember getting Gary Payton and Karl Malone same year , and it just did n t work . I remember getting Steve Nash and Dwight Howard , and same thing . It just do n t work . So bring in one guy , a guy who s just going to make his teammates better so everyone is good when it s time to play for a championship . YS : Take me through how you came up with the idea for the Big 3 . Is it true that watching Kobe score 60 in his final game was somewhat of an inspiration ? Ice Cube : I was inspired before that , but that was the last straw . As a fan , I was a little beside myself that there was nowhere I could go and pay to see this guy play anymore after 20 years of going to watch him . It s a little selfish , but I felt like there were more people out there like me . I called Jeff Kwatinetz and I m like , â€˜ Man , we ve got to figure this out . There s a lot of guys who still have gas in the tank and people will still pay to see play , but they have no way to play against their peers . I was like , â€˜ This 3-on-3 idea that I ve had works perfectly with these players . So we took the merger of two ideas and thats how it really started . YS : You ve partnered with Fox and Adidas and grown the Big 3 quite a bit in just one year . What s your five-year vision for what the league can become ? Ice Cube : My five-year vision is that it becomes part of the fabric of American sports , or even world sports , where people are looking forward to the Big 3 like they do the NBA or the NFL . I really want them to look forward to the Big 3 like OK the [ NBA ] Finals are over especially this Finals let s see some more basketball with players that we ve learned to love over the years . Another aspect is the growth of 3-on-3 basketball . In five years , you ll have seen this played in the Olympics , which to me will finally get people to realize that 3-on-3 is here to stay . We ll have the pro version of it and we want to elevate it not only here but around the world . I m in China right now talking to people like Yao Ming to try to bring Big 3 China into existence . I m doing the same thing in Brazil , so the vision is to create a World Cup style game of 3-on-3 basketball . We d have the best teams from around the world hopefully coming to America and competing in our league . YS : You see some ex-pros who can still play and then you see some guys who look like they have n t shot a ball or lifted weights once since they retired . How often do you approach a guy about playing in the Big 3 and he s like , â€˜ No way man . I m done . Ice Cube : We had first-year growing pains . Guys did n t know what to expect , whether it was a pick-up kind of thing or like an all-star game or something . What happened was a real league broke out and it became survival of the fittest . Some guys tried to work themselves into shape as the season went along because it s a fast game with a 14-second shot clock . Guys realized real quick that , yo , this is grueling as an NBA game even though it does n t seem like it should be . This year , it wo n t be an issue as much because our guys are in shape , chiseled , ready to go . They know what it takes now . What you re going have now , and what we have had , is guys who say , â€˜ Dude , I ca n t compete on that level anymore . I m done . And if you ve got a big name but you ca n t compete anymore , we do n t want you anyway . We do n t want your name . We want your game . YS : Have you tried to recruit Kobe ? Ice Cube : I believe Kobe is done . But you never know . That s what is great about the Big 3 . Whenever you get that itch , whenever you feel like hey man , I want to ball some more , then we re here . YS : Let s switch over to music for a second . When was the first time you remember hearing one of your own songs on the radio and what was that experience like ? Ice Cube : I was in a group called Stereo Crew , and we did a song [ released by ] Epic Records called â€˜ She s a Skag . We cut the song , and we think , â€˜ Oh man , we re on Epic Records . We re about to be rich . Then we never hear the song on the radio . I m like , â€˜ Damn , what s going on ? This was my education to the music business . Just because you did a song does n t mean that everyone is going to run out and buy it . Weeks go by , months go by , and one day I was with Dre at the swap meet . That was where Dre started doing his mix tapes from , and I started talking about what was going on in the hood and it really honed in the style that we needed to do . So we re leaving the swap meet , we just bought a fistful of records to sample and do all that stuff , and they played â€˜ She s a Skag on the radio . I almost lost my mind . I m like , â€˜ Turn it up ! I thought every car on the street was listening to it . It was one of those moments where I felt like , â€˜ Damn , we got over the hump . The song never picked up any traction . I probably heard it on the radio like three more times , but it was still the coolest thing . YS : Diss tracks have been in the news lately with the beef between Drake and Pusha T . You of course wrote one of the great ones of all time with â€˜ No Vaseline . What makes a good diss track and do you have a favorite one from another artist ? Ice Cube : You ve really got to hurt feelings to get a good diss . It s about hitting em where it hurts . I m not really into going after kids , family members and wives and stuff like that . I think certain things are overboard . But I do go for the jugular , and I do think you have to inflict pain to have a great diss and you ve got to be clever in how you present that diss . The song that I think is one of the coolest diss records is from 50 Cent . It s called Back Down and he s dissing Ja Rule . To me , it s almost a perfect diss record as far as song , beat , rhyme , delivery and potency . YS : I know you were traveling , but did you see that Lonzo released a diss track on Kyle Kuzma this week ? Ice Cube : What ? Lonzo Ball ? YS : Yup . Ice Cube : Is it a real diss ? Or just kind of you diss me , I diss you ? YS : It s honestly hard to tell . He goes pretty hard . Ice Cube : It s cool if it s a publicity thing I guess , but it s whack if it s not . It s like what the hell is going on ? Somebody might get traded . Might make Magic s job a little easier . YS : Let s finish up with a couple quick hitters . You re starting an NBA team . Would you rather have Michael in his prime or LeBron in his prime ? Ice Cube : You go with Michael . It s nothing to do with game or numbers . I think it s between the ears . Mike is wired different . LeBron is physically gifted . He walks in the door better than most players because of his physical stature . Jordan willed himself better . He makes himself better than you , he takes your confidence from you and he steps up to all challenges . I want this guy . I m locking him down . Not today . That s what you want in a basketball player . I want that mentality of taking no prisoners and destroying your enemy . YS : Los Angeles has two new NFL teams now , the Rams and the Chargers . Is this a Rams town ? A Chargers town ? Or still a Raiders town . Ice Cube : Please . It s a Raiders town , but the Rams are starting to reestablish their position that they had before they moved . I do n t know what the Chargers are doing . It s a mess . They re in the way . Nobody wants them . They re getting booed when they play the Raiders in their own stadium . That s pretty pathetic .

		"paragraph": "Reuters/KCNA Could North Korea 's economy , the most isolated in the world , ever follow in the footsteps of Vietnam 's ? Even as Pyongyang warms up to the leader of the free world , some analysts doubt it . Seoul-based Maeil Business Newspaper reported Kim Jong Un said during a private summit with South Korea that he saw a \" Vietnam-like \" opening of the country , probably referring to Hanoi in 1986 . Vietnam 's ruling communist party dropped collectivism to pursue a \" socialist-oriented market economy , \" under which the country 's GDP growth increased by an average of 3 % per year over the next decade . But the chances of North Korea successfully emulating the Vietnam model are \" slim , \" according to a team of economists at Capital Economics led by Gareth Leather . They think even if the economy is opened up , foreign investors are likely to be very cautious as they remember previous financial ventures in North Korea . A few examples : Korean companies that invested in the Mount Kumgang tourist region and the Kaesong industrial complex saw their assets frozen after bilateral relations soured . And a joint venture by Chinese mining company Xiyang to build a mine in North Korea was terminated less than a year after production began . On top of that , experts say it 's unlikely the North Korean dictator would allow his regime to shift in the way they sometimes do when an economy opens . One potential reason Kim sees Vietnam as a model , according to Leather , is that their ruling party achieved economic development while maintaining a firm grip on power . But this is n't always the case . \" There are examples of other countries in Asia , most notably Korea and Taiwan , where development and the opening of the economy to the outside world have played an important role behind the emergence of democratic movements , \" he said . There are a number of factors that Pyongyang could capitalize on through open borders , including its geographical position next to major economies like China and Japan and access to natural resources . The country sits on rich , largely untapped reserves of zinc , iron and some rare-earth metals often used in electronics . But it 's unclear if or when US sanctions against North Korea could be lifted . Economic penalties the US imposes on Pyongyang relate to proliferation and human rights violations , issues North Korea has gone back on with the US in previous agreements . An agreement signed by President Donald Trump and Kim early Tuesday said North Korea will \" work toward complete denuclearization , \" but it did not provide details on when or how . The president later told reporters he 'd halt US-South Korea joint military drills , which stunned both Seoul and Washington . US officials in South Korea had \" received no updated guidance on the execution or cessation of training exercises , \" the Associated Press reports . Trump said the two leaders touched on certain human rights abuses , but did not offer any further details , and the subject was absent from the statement and opening remarks . A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment . \" As expected , the historic meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jung Un produced photo ops and statements of goodwill , but is only the first step in a long road of negotiations , \" said Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance , a Charlotte-based firm . \" The lack of specifics from the meeting including a lack of timelines leave little to trade on and so the impact on markets from the summit has been negligible . \" NOW WATCH : A Navy SEAL explains why you should get up at 4:30 am every day See Also : SEE ALSO : 21 photos of North Korea that Kim Jong Un would n't want you to see",

[ MUSIC ] Kate Middleton has taken style cues from the late Princess Diana for years . In fact , we ve counted , and based solely on her public appearances , she s done so 26 times . But the same ca n t be said for newlywed Meghan Markle , who , prior to exchanging vows to Prince Harry , generally marched to the beat of her own sartorial drum . Until Saturday . Over the weekend , Markle joined Harry in Stoke Rochford , Lincolnshire , for the wedding of Princess Diana s niece Celia McCorquodale and George Woodhouse . She made waves thanks to a casual and breezy ( and not cheap ) Oscar de la Renta dress ( $ 5,490 modaoperandi.com ) plus a pair of Aquazurra shoes she reportedly also wore to her own wedding reception . However , there may be more to her look than meets the eye . It turns out Markle may decided to honor McCorquodale s late aunt by turning to Diana s fashion archives . In November 1986 , Diana wore a long-sleeve , tunic-like dress with pants and pointed-toe flats for a royal visit in Saudi Arabia . The design featured a blue floral , almost paisley-like print , similar to Markle s de la Renta design . Will Markle , like Middleton , suddenly begin honoring Diana through her fashion ? It s likely , given that her style has already evolved since she got married . Can we request bike shorts and college sweatshirts next ? Thanks .",

Sharapova , the 2006 champion who was trying to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2012 , hit 38 unforced errors and dropped serve six times . The defeat ended the former world number one 's perfect record of 23 wins -- 22 of them on Arthur Ashe Stadium -- in night sessions at Flushing Meadows . Suarez Navarro , who celebrated her 30th birthday Monday , was a quarter-finalist in New York in 2013 . \" Maria has played here at night many times so I knew I needed to be aggressive , focussed and play solid , \" said the 30th seeded Spaniard . \" I told myself to run and fight -- that 's the way I can play really good tennis . \" She will face 2017 runner-up Madison Keys for a place in the semi-finals . \" Madison is from the United States so I guess all the crowd will be for her . \" I have played her a few times .

On Thursday , Chaffetz posted a photo of himself posing with a Native American statue at Disneyland , writing , At Disneyland today with Senator Elizabeth Warren . Chaffetz was targeting Warren s DNA test reveal earlier this week that found the great majority of [ Warren s ] identifiable ancestry is European and the analysis also identified 5 genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence . Twitter users seized on Chaffetz s tweet , calling him out for what they felt was not only not funny , but also highly inappropriate . Warren , a Massachusetts Democrat , took the DNA test after President Trump challenged her during a Montana rally in July . I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity , paid for by Trump , if you take the test and it shows you re an Indian , he said . I have a feeling she will say no but hold it for the debates . My parents were real people , the love they shared , the struggles they endured , the family they built , the story they lived will always be on my heart . And no one , not even the president of the United States , will ever take it away from me , Warren said in a video statement sharing the results . She also asked that Trump donate his promised reward to the nonprofit National Indigenous Women s Resource Center . Warren s heritage has been controversial since her 2012 Senate run when opponent Sen. Scott Brown , R-Mass. , accused her of using her background as career leverage , according to CNN . Professor Warren claimed that she was a Native American , a person of color . And as you can see , she s not , said Brown . Warren responded , As a kid , I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage . What kid would ? But I knew my father s family did n t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware , so my parents had to elope . In 2012 , Warren also admitted to listing herself as Native American in Harvard Law School s directory where she taught during the 1990s , reported CNN .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap of Week 8 of Dancing With the Stars contains spoilers . The pros called the shots this week on Dancing With the Stars for the first half of the show , anyway when they picked the song and dance style for their celebrity partners for their Week 8 dance . Later in the show , the judges picked a troupe member to join each couple for a trio round . In a nutshell : Three was company and Len was grumpy . Even before this trios biz , the Week 8 itch hit Bonner Bolton and Sharna Burgess hard , and it did n t help that the Aussie pro wanted the pro bull rider to revisit his near-fatal riding accident for the umpteenth time this season . The tension was so high that Bonner walked out of rehearsals , but the couple reconnected on the dance floor for a 30-point Argentine Tango to Imagine Dragons Believer . Still , Len Goodman made it clear that he thought Bonner overstayed his welcome on the celebrity ballroom competition . You get frustrated , please do n t blame the judges . Blame the viewers , the cranky judge said . You ve gone a bridge too far . I m sorry but you should have been â€¦ ( We imagine the fill-in-the-blank word to be gone , but the audience boos cut him off . ) For the trio round , two sexy secretaries ( Sharna and troupe beauty Britt Stewart ) were n t enough to keep CEO Bonner on the payroll . Carrie Ann Inaba and Len both thought the office-themed trio dance was raunchy , ( I feel like I need to take a shower , CAI quipped ) , while Bruno said the girls deserve a rise oops , he meant a raise . What they all got were pink slips , though . Bonner got the news that he wo n t be heading to next week s semi-finals , so it s back to the ranch for Sharna s stud . I was very surprised at how far I went , the bull rider said after his elimination was announced . I went farther than I ever thought I would . I m just so thankful for the journey I got to take . I found out how far I can really push myself and how much I can take . Here s how the rest of the duos ( and trios ) did : Normani and Val performed a stripped-down Contemporary to the song Freedom by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton after The Fifth Harmony singer detailed her past experience with cyber-bullying and racist attacks . The emotional dance included troupe dancers forming a ring around the singer , and it earned the star her second perfect score in a row . Bruno Tonioli said Normani deserved the Pulitzer Prize for extraordinary storytelling , while Julianne Hough gave her a standing O during her critique . I ca n t sit down . I m completely mesmerized , Julianne said . Carrie Ann told the star , I m sorry for what you have been through , but tonight what I saw was healing . Thank you for such a profound moment . Trio Time : Normani and Val scored Alan Bersten for a Feeling Alive jive , and the country-themed dance got rave reviews and an almost-perfect score . Len dinged the trio a point for one particular section : I do n t like the standing on the judges desk , he said of Normani s mini - solo . It s just a little timewaster ! Rashad did his happy dance after Emma chose the Blues Brothers song Shake a Tail Feather for their jive . The pro dancer said the happy song reminds her of the NFL star because people gravitate towards him and he s the ultimate teammate . The judges all loved the routine , but all four of them pointed out that Rashad needs to work on his footwork . It s Week 8 , Carrie Ann said . It s the tiny little details . Hmm , in dancing is n t footwork kind of a big deal ? Guess that s why we re not the judges . Trio Time : It was a M nage a Shad when Rashad and Emma teamed up with Emma s bridesmaid Witney Carson for an Argentine Tango to Dreams by Gabrielle Aplin & Bastille . Len emphasized once again that the NFL star has footwork issues : You got dancing in your blood , it s just not reached your feet yet ! he said . Sasha Farber clearly does n t know his partner s musical taste , as could be seen by the massive eye roll Simone gave him when he picked the One Direction song What Makes You Beautiful for their foxtrot . 1D disses aside , Simone performed a safe dance which Len said was full of youthful exuberance , but Carrie Ann told the Olympian she still does n t feel like the audience knows her well because she hides her emotions . That s what living in a gym for 14 years will do to you , we later find out . Trio Time : Simone and Sasha were joined by Brittany Cherry for a Paso Dobl to Do n t Let Me Down , and Carrie Ann said she was happy to see more smiles and emotion from the Olympic gymnast . But Simone later threw shade at the judge by saying , Smiling does n t earn gold medals . David and Lindsay took a father-daughter dance to an adorable level with a waltz to Humble and Kind by Tim McGraw . The pro dancer said the MLB catcher is like a second dad to her , and their dance was so sweet and poignant that Bruno predicted that brides-to-be will download it and copy the moves for their father-daughter wedding dances . While Julianne said Fun Dad David is the heart of the competition , Len gave the World Series champ the ultimate compliment : You attempted to get the correct footwork , which most of the celebrities totally disregard , he said . It was 100 percent your best dance . Trio Time : Troupe member Hayley Erbert was in the house for a Gangsta s Paradise Paso Dobl , but Len thought the whole thing was a crime . I did n t like it at all , he said . It was rough . Bruno s comment was n t much better : At times you looked like Godzilla chasing jet fighters , he told the MLB star .

The 17-year-old Kim , whose parents moved to the United States from South Korea before she was born , scored a 93.75 on her first run , which was good enough to place her at the top of podium . She topped it on her final run with a 98.25 . China s Jiayu Liu won silver with a second run of 89.75 , while American Arielle Gold took bronze with a final-run score of 85.75 . I was like tearing up and wanted to cry , but I just knew I was n t going to be happy , even if I went home with the gold , if I knew I could do better , Kim said . So that third run was really just to prove to myself that I deserved it and did everything I could . I m so happy . Kim qualified for the Sochi Games and would have been the favorite if not for one problem : At 13 , she was too young to participate . Neither her age nor her skills were an issue at the PyeongChang Games , where she entered as the heavy favorite and met the lofty expectations . I try not to feel pressure because that kind of throws you off , she said .

The suit , filed on Oct. 13 , names four plaintiffs across the country , and seeks to represent a class of thousands of consultants , yet undetermined , who demand to take LuLaRoe to trial on six counts of misconduct under California law including unlawful , fraudulent , and unfair business practices , advertising , and breach of contract . The lawsuit s primary accusation is that LuLaRoe rescinded its buyback policy after it led consultants including the named plaintiffs : Stella Lemberg , Jeni Laurence , Amandra Bluder , and Carissa Stuckart to believe they could continue to buy clothing risk-free , given the 100 percent buyback guarantee . For the uninitiated , here s how the company works : LuLaRoe , known for its maxi skirts and zany print leggings that cost $ 25 to $ 75 , does n t have any employee-run stores . Instead , individuals sign up to sell LuLaRoe clothes as independent retailers , after they ve been referred to the company by someone who s already involved . Once approved , the independent retailer must buy a minimum of $ 5,000 worth of inventory to start selling LuLaRoe clothes to whomever they like for a price determined by LuLaRoe corporate . In a statement to Yahoo Lifestyle about the new class action filing , LuLaRoe says : We have not been served with the complaint . We believe these allegations are wholly without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them . LuLaRoe will in good faith continue to abide by the terms of the Policies and Procedures accepted and binding upon every Independent Fashion Retailer executing the LuLaRoe Independent Consultant Application and Agreement which includes mediation and legal arbitration as the appropriate forums for addressing any disputes about the Retailer cancellation , return and refund process . LuLaRoe is no stranger to legal trouble and bad press , though the most recent filing appears to make the most damning claims . A change to the company s 100 percent buyback guarantee , which promised consultants they would be fully refunded for unwanted inventory should they choose to exit the company , was abruptly made in September , turning it into a bait-and-switch refund policy that cheats consultants out of thousands of dollars each , according to the lawsuit complaint . We re focusing on the misrepresentation and breach of contract to the consultants , Amber Eck , the lawyer who filed the class action suit with co-counsel Kelly Purcaro , explains to Yahoo Lifestyle . Most recently , Eck was co-lead counsel in the class action case against Donald Trump and Trump University , which settled for $ 25 million . This case is reminiscent of that . [ The Trump class action ] was n t multi-level marketing , but it was an upsell scheme , said Eck . This case is reminiscent of that . LuLaRoe is now facing several class action lawsuits , all filed in the past year . The first alleged that inventory was defective others suits claim that the company s sales app charged retailers an erroneous tax . In just over a year , plaintiffs filed 17 civil suits against LuLaRoe . In addition , LuLaRoe has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau , and the Federal Trade Commission has recorded more than 300 complaints against the company since May , according to documents Yahoo Lifestyle obtained . The class action suit filed last week is only the latest in a long list of the company s alleged infractions . LuLaRoe had a quaint beginning . In 2012 , founder DeAnne Stidham s daughter pregnant at the time posted a photo on Instagram of a skirt that her mother sewed for her . The likes poured in along with requests for skirts , which Stidham fulfilled . Soon Stidham was fielding so many requests that she outsourced the production to local seamstresses and recruited others to help her sell . When production reached a certain level , her husband Mark joined the company as its chief executive . Today , LuLaRoe has 325,000 Instagram followers , and the company name has been used as a hashtag more than 2.6 million times . It boasts 80,000 sales reps independent retailers who sell LuLaRoe apparel on their own . In an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle in May , Mark and DeAnnne Stidham said that they take LuLaRoe criticism very personally . In addition to the daily tasks of running the company , the couple exhaustively tours the country promoting LuLaRoe to its consultant network . They also take a very active role in the lives of LuLaRoe retailers , participating in incentive cruises with them and even taking a trip to Hawaii , where they met a team of LuLaRoe retailers . And while the legal woes mount , the comments on DeAnne s Instagram page show no hint of that her posts are peppered with retailers thanking DeAnne and expressing a desire to meet her in person . Retailers , many of whom have been with LuLaRoe since its earliest days , often refer to DeAnne and Mark as pseudo-parental figures . Depending on your level of cynicism , you may find that endearing . Or you may think it s cult-like . However you see it does n t change the fact that LuLaRoe is staving off new legal issues regularly , even as new consultants sign on with the company . $ 1.8 billion in sales and growing When the retail apocalypse began in 2016 , apparel companies that spent years cultivating loyal customers began to sink . Some , like J. Crew , found themselves lost in a sea of sameness , their core customers having abandoned ship . Others found themselves not being able to keep up with the rise of online , instant everything . But LuLaRoe thrived , in large part because of the community it created with consumers and its consultants . Customers flock to events at LuLaRoe pop-up shops , hosted by local women who invite their friends and neighbors to shop . The rise of LuLaRoe happened to coincide with momentum in the direct-sales industry itself . According to its trade group , the Direct Selling Association ( DSA ) , more than 20 million people were involved in the business in the U.S. in 2015 , with estimated retail sales reaching $ 36.12 billion a 4.8 percent increase over 2014 . Some direct sales businesses are household names : Herbalife , Mary Kay , and Avon , each of which belongs to the DSA . LuLaRoe is not one of DSA s 170 members , and has no plans to join . Stidham says that s because it s not aligned with [ direct sales organizations ] generally . How it works : the original social network LuLaRoe retailers , many of whom are women , are recruited to sell LuLaRoe merchandise by existing retailers . More than 80,000 people now sell LuLaRoe in the U.S. By comparison , there were more than 4.5 million retail salespeople as of May 2016 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Independent retailers for LuLaRoe have four possible levels they can rise up to : consultant , sponsor , trainer , coach , and mentor . It s that structure that leads the class action lawsuit to allege the company is a pyramid scheme . If a consultant brings in additional consultants , she is elevated to â€˜ sponsor status , but must maintain additional inventory requirements monthly , explains the new class action complaint . If a consultant brings in 10 or more additional consultants , she is elevated to â€˜ trainer status and so on . But the company pays its bonuses based on sales volume , not the size of a sales team itself , which LuLaRoe says proves it operates legitimately and legally . Higher bonuses go to those in higher-ranking levels ( meaning coaches and mentors ) . The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment for this story , but its website reads : If the money you make is based on your sales to the public , it may be a legitimate multilevel marketing plan . If the money you make is based on the number of people you recruit and your sales to them , it s probably not . It could be a pyramid scheme . Pyramid schemes are illegal , and the vast majority of participants lose money . A hard-charging ethos from LuLaRoe leadership Mark Stidham outraged many LuLaRoe retailers when , during a now-infamous webinar , he told retailers that were concerned about how defective clothes would affect their sales , No , you re stale . Your customers are stale . Get out and find new customers . If you bring a new customer in , then your inventory is n t stale . The problem is , you try to sell to the same group of people day after day after day . When asked about these comments , Mark defends himself , saying people who were upset over his remarks just do n t understand them . It may sound harsh when I challenge people , but it does n t come from a harsh place , he says . It comes from my belief in their ability that they will break through their excuses , if they re creative , to sell the product . For some consultants , like Meagan Parker , Mark s tough love has been effective : Parker , who joined LuLaRoe three years ago she was the 93rd retailer to join has doubled down on her LuLaRoe business and recently purchased her own van-turned-LuLaRoe pop-up shop . Parker says she was the first person east of Utah to sign on to sell LuLaRoe , effectively making her a settler in uncharted territory . At the time , her husband worked as a regional manager for Petco , but he recently quit his job to join his wife s LuLaRoe venture full-time . Parker declines to disclose her income , but says profit and income is based on you . When you work your business , that s the cool thing about LuLaRoe â€¦ the harder you work , just like with anything , the more success you ll have . Consultants Yahoo Lifestyle spoke with say that Parker s success is n t necessarily proof of the effectiveness of Mark s hard-charging mantra as much as it is because she was early to the game . Now that many parts of the U.S. are saturated with sellers , some LuLaRoe consultants complain on forums that it s too hard to succeed . Parker now has more than 16,000 retailers operating under her , meaning she earns annual bonuses based on how many sales the people who she has brought on ( and subsequently , the people they recruited ) execute . But she says her success is n t dictated on team growth , and that LuLaRoe is n t a multilevel marketing company because its growth is facilitated through product sales , not recruitment . Pep rallies and cruises Here s a sense of just how deeply attached LuLaRoe sellers are to the LuLaRoe community : Parker hosts regular Monday morning webinars she writes a weekly LuLaRoe blog post , she hosts a LuLaRoe book club and she hosts Sunday suppers , where she and her husband cook for LuLaRoe peers . There are LuLaRoe cruises , open to retailers and their spouses . There are LuLaBros , men who are brand devotees because of their LuLaRoe business or their partner s . LuLaRoe retailers wear matching triangle-shaped necklaces ( or pyramid-shaped , depending on whom you ask ) , a shape repeated in LuLaRoe s logo , and , some speculate , a reference to Mark and DeAnne s Mormon faith . ( They deny it s a religious reference , noting in a statement : No . LuLaRoe s logo design is based on principles of color , geometry and style , and the design of the necklaces aligns with the shapes in the logo . ) Indeed , the promise of a built-in community and a commitment to women s empowerment attracts many consultants to the company . LuLaRoe holds itself out to be champions of women with children , seeking financial freedom by working from home , the Oct. 13 class action lawsuit says . But to the more than half a dozen LuLaRoe consultants Yahoo Lifestyle spoke with , joining LuLaRoe means ingratiating yourself with a community where mean girl-style groupthink and potentially overwhelming financial risk may rule . The risks of rushing into LuLaRoe Amanda Goldfarb is a former LuLaRoe consultant who left the company in July after only a few months selling the apparel . A new mother , Goldfarb describes how she was lured in by the company s promise of empowerment and financial freedom . After an initial $ 6,700 investment , Goldfarb and her husband were selling $ 20,000 worth of inventory a month , and she recruited 16 women to work under her . Despite the apparent success , Goldfarb says the horrible bullying she experienced left her feeling gaslighted . The woman in my upline who made my life miserable she s a number two seller in the company , Goldfarb says . Anytime someone had a question on the team page or had a genuine concern , she was so rude and aggressive . It got to a point where everything she said was really negative and nasty . It would hurt people s feelings . Goldfarb then describes trying desperately to find a new team to join , waiting hours on hold and talking through her tears with LuLaRoe s home office only to be told repeatedly that there was nothing the company could do to help . They preach these high standards about morals and empowering each other , but they let one of their top sellers which is n t a coincidence they let her tear multiple people down . And she knows she wo n t be touched because she makes them so much money . Elena P. , another former consultant , confirmed LuLaRoe s culture of bullying , but says that she decided to exit the company after an abrupt change to the terms of the company s electronic sales system which she says transferred an unfair amount of liability and responsibility to consultants confirmed in her mind that the company s operations were shady . Elena says she felt more comfortable resigning from LuLaRoe , despite having thousands of dollars in unsold inventory , because of the 100 percent buyback policy , a claim that the Oct. 13 class action filing also says is true of other consultants . LuLaRoe processed Elena s resignation in July , before the company reinstated what it says was its original , 90 percent buyback policy . ( LuLaRoe says the 100 percent buyback policy was a temporary waiver , only instituted from April to September 2017 , but a document cited in the Oct. 13 filing says , this policy does not have an expiration date , nor does it have a required time frame in which the product should have been purchased in . ) She says she d expected $ 5,500 back from her returns made to the company , based on the 100 percent buyback . After following LuLaRoe-outlined procedures for receiving refunds , Elena says she has still not been repaid . But the overwhelming sense of community was enough to attract prospective consultants to sign on to the company , despite growing concerns about everything from defective inventory to buggy sales systems . Julia ( not her real name ) , a mother of two , became a LuLaRoe seller in spring 2016 . I got hooked , she says . I got caught up in the limited prints , and if you find something , you better buy it right away because you never know if you ll find it in your size again . She stayed up late , nursing her newborn in one arm and scrolling through LuLaRoe sales online with the other hand . If that sounds excessive , Dr. Art Markman , a University of Texas Austin psychology professor , says it s common for people like Julia to join a direct sales business when they re searching for a community . One aspect of multilevel marketing companies is that they try to capture people s aspirations . You have people who would like to be successful particularly financially successful and do n t see another route to that , Markman says . They tend to capture people who feel often like they do n t have lot of power in their environment , which is why a number multilevel marketing companies focus on women and minority groups . They harness the social element of it . Before Julia joined LuLaRoe , she had grueling night-shift hours , which stole time away time from her two young children . LuLaRoe seemed like a way out . A friend who was selling for LuLaRoe encouraged her . She said she made $ 10,000 in sales in one month , Julia recalls . She kind of led me to believe that this was profit . Julia s initial inventory buy-in was $ 8,000 ( packages start at approximately $ 5,000 ) and she invested another $ 3,000 in supplies for her pop-ups , such as hangers and racks . She spoke to her sponsor , reached out to consultants she found on Facebook , and talked to fellow LuLaRoe sellers at a nearby church . There were all these success stories . â€¦ Everyone was saying how great and wonderful it was , she says . There was no negativity , no negative feedback . It was all positive . Tough love or debt trap ? It did n t take long for Julia s LuLaRoe business to spiral out of control . She had invested $ 11,000 , and then could n t move all the inventory . She attended a LuLaRoe convention ( not free ) , thinking she d learn how to be a more effective saleswoman . Instead , it was a giant pep rally , leaving Julia disappointed and without new information or tips on how to sell her inventory . Critics in the closed LuLaRoe Defective/Ripped/Torn Leggings and Clothes Facebook group the most populated group focused on LuLaRoe , with more than 45,000 members echo the claims made in the Oct. 13 class action filing : that LuLaRoe touts itself as a women s empowerment platform , freeing working moms from the merciless toils of corporate employment in favor of being your own boss . But the critics say the sacrifices constrict more than they liberate . By the one-year mark , Julia says , she was in debt to the tune of nearly $ 30,000 . Consultants were also encouraged to max-out their credit cards with inventory purchases , all of which would be refunded at 100 percent , plus free shipping , should the consultants decide to stop selling for LuLaRoe , the Oct. 13 class action filing alleges . The consultants we have spoken to , on average , have $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 in inventory they are seeking to have refunded , but we do n t currently know the total amount of damages , which will be further ascertained through discovery , says the class action litigator Eck . Dozens of LuLaRoe consultants with LLCs filed for bankruptcy in the last year . And while that might seem like a small portion of the thousands of nationwide LuLaRoe consultants , those are just the ones that appear in the court records because they include LuLaRoe in the name , and only reveal the individuals who filed an LLC entity to protect their personal assets from bankruptcy should they go into debt selling LuLaRoe merchandise . If those numbers still seem small , consider this , from a 2014 Al Jazeera report : Among the victims of the 10 most common consumer frauds , those defrauded by pyramid schemes are by far the least likely to file a complaint , according to a 2004 Federal Trade Commission report . And the company s publicly available income disclosure statement warns : Figures are not guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits . They do not include expenses incurred by Independent Retailers in operating or promoting their independent businesses . LuLaRoe makes no guarantee of financial success . â€¦ Your success will depend on whether you possess these qualities and , if so , how well you exercise these qualities . Trying to get out of LuLaRoe Trying to leave LuLaRoe can be even harder than swallowing sunk costs . There are logistical issues , such as shipping back excess inventory and waiting months for refunds to arrive , assuming the changes to LuLaRoe s buyback policy which used to guarantee 100 percent of inventory in acceptable condition be refunded after return , but now offers up to 90 percent with numerous stipulations do n t retroactively leave you stuck with hundreds of LuLaRoe items and no way to return them . ( Once your exit from the company is processed , you no longer have access to internal resources or documents , the new lawsuit alleges . ) As an alternative , retailers looking to leave host going out of business sales or GOOBS , as they re frequently called on social media pricing their inventory far below suggested retail prices to cut their losses . But LuLaRoe prohibits its retailers from hosting such sales . When asked about the no-GOOBS policy , LuLaRoe said , We encourage Independent Fashion Retailers who are going out of business to return their inventory to LuLaRoe . LuLaRoe also asks its retailers to agree to a non-disparagement clause . They use bullying and scare tactics if you re trying to get out , Julia said . It s been very stressful trying to get out . As with the LuLaRoe Defective/Ripped/Torn Leggings and Clothes Facebook group , consultants with whom Yahoo Lifstyle spoke say there are other closed Facebook forums that operate as pseudo-support groups and safe havens for consultants looking to sell their merchandise quickly , and where they share stories about working as a LuLaRoe retailer . The Defective/Ripped/Torn Leggings and Clothes Facebook group lists rules that include statements like , Anyone caught trying to get a consultant in this group in trouble with compliance , their upline , whatever , will be banned from the group . Yahoo Lifestyle confirmed with a LuLaRoe spokesperson that among the tens of thousands of members are LuLaRoe corporate employees who work as moles to monitor which consultants are breaking the rules . Another closed Facebook group with nearly 20,000 members , called Leave the Woe , is focused on helping struggling , independent LuLaRoe retailers conduct GOOBS by connecting buyers with the LuLaRoe clothing they re looking for . Christina Hinks is a former LuLaRoe consultant who frequently writes about the company on her blog , Mommy Gyver . If I m offline for a period of time , not posting , people think LuLaRoe s sent people out to kill me , Hicks said to Yahoo Lifestyle in a May interview . She s joking , but says LuLaRoe has sent her veiled threats of a legal nature to get her to stop posting on her blog . In September , LuLaRoe filed a petition for discovery against Hicks to compel her to reveal the sources who she cites in her own blog posts criticizing the company . When asked whether it s tough to leave LuLaRoe , Mark , during his interview with Yahoo Lifestyle in the spring before the buyback policy changed defended the company . One of my absolute core philosophies is if we take your money , we owe you value . Detractors call LuLaRoe a pyramid scheme . They call the company evil , and they blame Mark and DeAnne . And yet , LuLaRoe says 90 percent of its retailers maintain their business today . There is no issue with people leaving the business , Mark says . If this is not for you , I do n t need to trick you into spending your money and staying here . As for Julia , she s still trying to claw her way out . Somewhere along the way , her sponsor once an enthusiastic LuLaRoe flag-waver also left .

		"paragraph": "Sebastien Roblin [ timestamp ] Security , Middle East Over time , Israel will likely acquire additional F-35s , as it intends for the type to replace its fleet of over 320 F-16s , starting with the now very old F-16A Netz aircraft first acquired in 1980s . Reportedly , Israel is even interested in possibly acquiring F-35B jump jets down the line . One usually thinks of F-35Bs as serving from smaller aircraft carriers or island bases , but Israel sees role for jump jets by dispersing them to remote improvised airstrips to avoid enemy air-base attacks . This still seems a somewhat extravagant solution to the threat , given that the F-35B is more expensive and has inferior performance to the F-35A for most other purposes . This may explain why an F-35B purchase is allegedly more popular with Israeli politicians than the Israeli Air Force . On May 22 , Israeli Air Force commander Amikam Norkin announced that its F-35I stealth fighters had flown on two combat missions on different fronts , showing as proof a photograph of an F-35 overflying Beirut . While details on those missions have not been released apparently , they were not deployed in a massive Israeli air attack on Iranian forces in Syria that took place on May 9 this nonetheless apparently confirmed the first combat operations undertaken by any variant of the controversial stealth jet , which is currently entering service with the militaries of ten countries after undergoing over two decades of development . In fact , Israel s F-35I Adir or Mighty Ones will be the only F-35 variant to enter service heavily tailored to a foreign country s specifications . There had been plans for a Canadian CF-35 , with a different refueling probe and drogue-parachute to allow landing on short Arctic air strips , but Ontario dropped out of the F-35 program . It has become a common practice to create custom variants of fourth-generation jet fighters such as the Su-30 , F-15 and F-16 for export clients , made to order with local avionics , weapons and upgrades that suit a particular air force s doctrine and strategic priorities . Today , Israel operates heavily upgraded F-15I Ra am ( Thunder ) and two-seater F-16I Sufa fighters . Furthermore , Israel in particular has n t hesitated to modify aircraft it has already received fit its needs : for example , in 1981 it rigged its then-new F-15A Eagle air superiority fighters to drop bombs , and used these first-ever strike Eagles to destroy the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor . Recommended : How an â€˜ Old F-15 Might Kill Russia s New Stealth Fighter Recommended : How China Plans to Win a War Against the U.S. Navy Recommended : How the Air Force Would Destroy North Korea However , the Lockheed-Martin has mostly refused to allow major country-specific modifications to the F-35 , despite the hundreds of millions of dollars foreign F-35 operators contributed to the aircraft s development . There is , of course , an efficiency-based rationale , given the additional costs and delays of creating country-specific variants , and the fact that Lockheed is struggling to both produce F-35s fast and cheaply enough and build enough spare parts for the hundreds already in service . Israel , however , managed to carve out an exception . Though not an investor in the F-35 s development , Tel Aviv was nonetheless quick to sign on to the program with an initial order of fifty . It also negotiated a favorable deal in which billions of dollars worth of F-35 wings and sophisticated helmet sets would be manufactured in Israel , paid for with U.S. military aid . Furthermore , depot-level maintenance will occur in a facility operated by Israeli Aeronautics Industries rather than at a Lockheed facility abroad . The first nine F-35s entered operational service in December 6 , 2017 , with the 140 Golden Eagles Squadron , based at Nevatim Airbase near Be er Sheva . Six more should arrive in 2018 . Israel will eventually activate a second squadron at Nevatim , and retains the option for an additional twenty-five F-35s to form a third squadron , likely based elsewhere . However , recent reports suggest a third squadron may postponed for a decade in favor of buying additional F-15Is , which trade the F-35 s stealth for greater range and payload . Israel has paid a high price of between $ 110 to $ 125 million per F-35 for its initial order , but in the future unit cost will supposedly decline to around $ 85 million . The first nineteen stealth jets received by Israel will actually be standard F-35A land-based fighters , while the following thirty-one will be true F-35Is modified to integrate Israeli-built hardware . However , most media sources have taken to labeling all of them as F-35Is , and it does appear even the initial batch will be retrofitted with an open-architecture Israeli Command , Control , Communications and Computing ( C4 ) system . The Lightning s sophisticated flight computer and ground-based logistics system has become a matter of contention with many F-35 operators . Foreign air forces would like to have greater access to the F-35 s computer source codes to upgrade and modify them as they see fit without needing to involve external parties but Lockheed does n t want to hand over full access for both commercial and security-based reasons . Israeli F-35Is uniquely will have an overriding Israeli-built C4 program that runs on top of Lockheed s operating system . One of F-35 s key capabilities come from its superior ability to soak up data with its sensors and share it with friendly forces . Compatibility with datalinks used by friendly Israeli air and ground forces is thus an important aspect from Israel s perspective as it tracks the position of hostile surface-to-surface rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles systems . The new system will also allow the IDF to install Israeli-built datalinks and defensive avionics systems such as radar-jamming pods . An official told Aviation Week the IAF expects the advantages of the F-35 s low radar cross section will be good for five to ten years before adversaries develop countermeasures . There already exist methods for detecting stealth fighters , including long-range infrared sensors , electromagnetic sensors , and low bandwidth radars ( though all have significant limitations ) , and more exotic technologies such as quantum radar are also under development . Thus , the IDF particularly values the flexibility to install plug-and-play defensive countermeasures such as jamming pods as they become relevant and available . It so happens the Israeli firms Elbit and Israeli Aerospace Industries are major developers of such systems . However , due to the F-35 s highly fused avionics , such plug-and-play support needs to be built both into F-35 software and apparently even the airframe . The add-ons will be installed in special apertures in the lower fuselage and leading edge of the wings presumably , features only in the later production F-35Is that arrive in 2020 . Israel is also developing two different sets of external fuel tanks to extend the F-35 s range . The first will be non-stealthy 425-gallon underwing tanks developed by a subsidiary of Elbit these could be dropped when approaching enemy airspace ( the pylons holding the drop tanks would reportedly detach as well so as not to compromise stealth ) , or used for missions in which stealth is n t necessary . Further down the line , IAI wants to co-develop with Lockheed bolt-on conformal fuel tanks which hug the F-35 airframe so as not to compromise stealth and aerodynamics . The F-35I will also be certified to carry major Israeli-developed weapons systems in its internal weapons bay , notably including the Python-5 short-range heat-seeking air-to-air missile , and the Spice family of glide bombs , which combine electro-optical , satellite and man-in-the-loop guidance options for greater targeting versatility and have a range of up to sixty miles . However , country-specific F-35 weapons capabilities are not unique to Israel . British Royal Air Force and Navy F-35s will be compatible with the Meteor and ASM-132 air-to-air missile , while Norway and Australia s Lightning IIs will be able to carry the Norwegian Naval Strike Missile , reflecting the importance of the sea-control mission for these nations . The United States even would like its NATO partners to purchase F-35s specially modified to deploy B-61 nuclear bombs . The Adir and Israeli Strategy Norkin s announcement of F-35 operations was as much a part of Israeli strategy as the actual deployment of the fighters . Tel Aviv wants potential adversaries ( chiefly , Iran , Syria , and Hezbollah ) to know that its fighters have already proven capable of infiltrating the airspace of neighboring countries , and that its stealth jets could at any moment launch an attack that may go undetected until the first bomb strikes a target . The F-35 has been criticized for its mediocre flight performance compared to earlier fourth-generation jets , meaning that it would be at a disadvantage in a short-range ai dogfight against enemy fighters . Supporters argue that the F-35 would leverage its stealth , sensors and long-range missiles to avoid getting that close to more agile opponent in the first place , and that the platform is really optimized more for striking targets in defended enemy airspace . The strike emphasis , however , is just fine with the Israeli Air Force , as since 1948 it has historically mostly trounced its opponents in air-to-air combat , but suffered heavy losses to ground-based air defenses in the 1973 Yom Kippur War . Since then , Israel jets have continued to face , and mostly defeat , hostile SAMs in scores of raids launched into Lebanon and Syria , though in February 2018 it suffered its first combat loss of a fighter in decades when Syrian S-200 missiles downed an Israeli F-16 . Since 2017 , there have been rumors of the F-35s involvement in these raids , though most of these rumors were likely inaccurate due to the risk of losing an airframe over hostile territory at this stage . Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyahu , in power since 2009 , clearly favors using military force to suppress Iran s nuclear research program , having opposed and undermined negotiated settlements . While Tel Aviv basically wants the United States to carry out such an attack , the F-35 makes an Israeli attack on Iran more practical . However , Israeli aircraft would have to fly through Turkey , or either Jordan and Syria and then Iraq to reach Iranian aerospace over six hundred miles away and remember , key targets will likely be much further from the border . This also happens test the range limit of most combat-loaded fourth-generation fighters , meaning they would need conspicuous aerial tankers to make the raid viable . Furthermore , Israeli warplanes would have to disable or destroy Iranian air defenses , which would require additional time and aircraft . Israeli jets violated Turkish airspace in 2007 in order to destroy a nuclear reactor in northern Syria . However a sustained air campaign traversing foreign airspace would be more difficult to execute than a one-time raid . However , the F-35 has a greater combat radius than most fourth-generation jets , due to its inability to carry extra fuel tanks without compromising stealth . Furthermore , it could more easily penetrate Iran s air defenses , and evade detection by neutral countries , than fourth-generation jets , lowering the necessary size of a strike package . Over time , Israel will likely acquire additional F-35s , as it intends for the type to replace its fleet of over 320 F-16s , starting with the now very old F-16A Netz aircraft first acquired in 1980s . Reportedly , Israel is even interested in possibly acquiring F-35B jump jets down the line . One usually thinks of F-35Bs as serving from smaller aircraft carriers or island bases , but Israel sees role for jump jets by dispersing them to remote improvised airstrips to avoid enemy air-base attacks . This still seems a somewhat extravagant solution to the threat , given that the F-35B is more expensive and has inferior performance to the F-35A for most other purposes . This may explain why an F-35B purchase is allegedly more popular with Israeli politicians than the Israeli Air Force . Israel has also been a proponent of a two-seat variant of the F-35 , which would be convenient for training purposes , and also allow a back-seat Weapon System Officer to manage the F-35s precision-guided weapons while the pilot focuses on flying . At any rate , the activities of Israel s Adirs are likely to continue to remain conspicuously in the news , if less so on hostile radars .

		"paragraph": "After what has felt like a never-ending stream of hype , $ 1.9 billion in funding and little else to show the public , the super-secretive augmented reality firm Magic Leap has finally shown off its long-awaited headgear . And it s , well , interesting . The Magic Leap One , Creator Edition will hit the market in 2018 and , according to Magic Leap at least , help revolutionize everything from education to games to your daily web browsing . That s exactly what you d expect from a company valued at north of $ 6 billion with investments from companies including Alibaba ( BABA ) and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) . Still , before you get too excited about this big reveal , there are a few things to keep in mind about Magic Leap One including the fact that we still have no release date , no price and no look at any actual content . Augmented reality , as it currently exists to most consumers , is largely smartphone based . Apple made sure its new AR Kit augmented reality platform was front and center when it unveiled its new iPhones , and Google has its ARCore tool . Most people who have used AR products have probably done so through Snapchat s ( SNAP ) filters and Niantic s Pok mon Go . The Magic Leap is different . First off , there s more to it than just a headset . Users will also have to clip a small , disk-shaped object to their hips that does all of the processing for the One . Having consumers put on headsets is already a big ask . Making them also clip on a computer just creates more friction for users . Microsoft s ( MSFT ) own augmented reality headset , Hololens , is fully self-contained and does n t require a separate processing unit . In press images , however , the Magic Leap One headset does look far less intrusive than traditional VR headsets like those offered by Facebook s ( FB ) Oculus Rift and Microsoft s new Windows Mixed Reality line . Instead of encompassing your head , the Magic Leap One looks more like a pair of welder s goggles with a series of sensors attached to it . Those sensors are what let the Magic Leap One track you where you are in the physical world . According to Brian Crecente of Rolling Stone s Glixel , who got to use the headset , Magic Leap will also solve the problem of wearing glasses while using VR and AR headgear by offering prescription lenses for the One . But that s also almost sure to drive up the as-yet-unannounced price of the product . Based on Crecente s description of his experience with Magic Leap , it sounds a bit like a more graphically impressive version of Hololens . During his briefing , Crecente was n t allowed to discuss much of the experiences he took part in . He gave small snippets of information , but Magic Leap would n t let him explain exactly what he was seeing while wearing the headset . In one example , he described how getting closer to a robot allowed him to see more details rather than having it turn into a mess of pixels . In another he described looking at a person who looked fairly realistic , but was n t exactly lifelike . There is , however , the issue of field of view . Crecente described it as about the size of a VHS tape held about half of an arm s length . Microsoft s Hololens also has a limited field of view , but it s smaller than the One s . I m personally skeptical of the One . Despite its lineup of heavy-hitting investors and its impressive pitch , I m not sure it will be the revolutionary device that it s being made out to be . According to Gartner Research analyst Tuong Nguyen , augmented reality and virtual reality headsets likely wo n t reach mass acceptance until they are as small as the glasses that many of us wear on a daily basis . Unfortunately , as Magic Leap s photos show , that kind of technology is still a long way off . There is also the matter of content . Magic Leap has n t shown us anything we can really look forward to , which leaves us hanging as to what to expect when we do eventually see it . What s more , will the content that we do eventually get to see be worth having to shell out money for the opportunity to wear a pair of high-tech goggles ? Virtual reality is stuck in a similar situation where there are n t any real compelling pieces of content that you specifically need a VR headset for . Nguyen says it could make sense for the One to work in the enterprise space where companies are already using similar technologies . But without any real idea as to how the One works , we re just left speculating . If the company can show off what its graphics and interface look like and what kinds of apps it actually uses , I might change my mind . But for now , I m keeping my expectations in check and you should too . More from Dan : Email Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley .",

		"paragraph": " You re in your second semester of AP Basketball History , you love really good teams , and you love lists . With precious little drama left in the NBA s 2015 offseason , why do n t we hit the barroom and/or barbershop , pour ourselves a frosty mug of Barbicide , and get to arguin over each franchise s most formidable starting five-man lineup . [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] Because we do n t like making tough decisions , the lineups will reflect the All-NBA line of thinking . There will be no differentiation between separate forward and guard positions , and the squads will be chosen after careful consideration of individual merits only we do n t really care if your team s top shooting guard and point guard do n t get along . These rankings will roll out based on when each franchise began its NBA life . We continue with the Washington Wizards , who have been known by many names . C : Wes Unseld . OK , so he probably should n t have won the MVP in his rookie season . His Baltimore Bullets were swept out of the first round of the playoffs that year and he averaged 13.7 points per game that season ( future teammate Elvin Hayes led the league , as a rookie , in nearly doubling that mark ) . Unseld still acted as the stabilizing defending , rebounding , passing , leading and sometimes scoring force on a litany of Baltimore-to-Washington squads that tore up the Eastern Conference for years , culminating in the 1978 NBA championship . F : Elvin Hayes . Just scored and rebounded and scored and rebounded and scored and rebounded . Averaged nearly 22 points and almost 13 rebounds as a member of the franchise , was the leading scorer on the team s 1978 championship squad , while showing a generation s worth of fans how , exactly , to nail a turnaround jumper from the low post . F : Gus Johnson . An astonishingly mobile and athletic player for any era , much less his own , Johnson s all-around game helped pave the way for the NBA that we re familiar with in 2015 . After bouncing around the AAU circuit , a junior college and one year at the then-remote University of Idaho , Johnson found a home throwing down monstrous dunks and mid-range jumpers as a frontcourt contributor for several standout Bullets clubs . A stellar defender as well , he retired as a five-time NBA All-Star . G : Earl Monroe . Emerging out of Winston-Salem State , Monroe devious scoring game was too often lauded for its flash by those that misunderstood the fundamentals , footwork , and well-honed touch that went into it . The Pearl spent just four years with the then-Bullets , but he averaged nearly 24 points per game with the team and nearly drove them toward a title in 1971 . G : Gilbert Arenas . He threw up a ton of shots , he acted the part of the doofus ( in ways both innocuous and harmful ) way too often , and he never played defense , but Arenas was still one of the best players at his position for Wizards teams that routinely made the playoffs . Prior to crippling knee injuries sapping him of his sprightly bounce , Arenas averaged over 28 points per game and six assists on the 2007 Wizards , making three All-Star games in his Washington career . As it is with seemingly each of these older franchises , Walt Bellamy missed the cut at center . Prior to the team s move to Baltimore , Bellamy was a reliable go-to scorer and rebounder on an aging and not-all-that-great Chicago Zephyrs expansion franchise right out of the gate , later needlessly panned for his huge numbers put up on a terrible team . The Wizards ( the team that employed Paul Pierce in 2014-15 ) are forever full of superstars past their primes . Moses Malone , Dave Bing , Bobby Dandridge ( who put the 1978 champs over the top ) , Mitch Richmond , Bernard King and swingman Michael Jordan all enjoyed fruitful if unfulfilling turns with the franchise . Meanwhile , Phil Chenier has the biggest gripe of them all . Never as flashy as either Earl Monroe or as self-promoting as Arenas , he nevertheless was the rock behind consistently great Washington Bullet teams in the 1970s . This is the five we re going with . Who would you take ? Previous entries : Golden State . Boston . New York . Detroit . Sacramento . Los Angeles Lakers . Atlanta .

		"paragraph": "One week after saying goodbye to a beloved character , Shameless said goodbye to season 9 for now . Sunday s Down Like the Titanic marked the midseason finale of Showtime s hit series , which will return for seven more episodes on Jan. 20 . And it was a busy hour : Fiona returned to the Gallagher house after her personal and professional lives fell apart Lip is possibly in a new relationship Frank is all in with off-her-meds Ingrid Debbie is the best little sister ever Kev and V are adopting and Carl is , crazily enough , studying ! ( For a full recap , go check out EW s Shameless shameless rankings . ) In order to get some scoop , EW called up Shameless boss John Wells to ask about Cameron Monaghan s departure , Emmy Rossum s impending exit , and what to expect for the rest of season 9 . ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY : Before we get into the finale , I d love to talk about the previous episode , which was so wonderfully done . For how long did you know Cameron was leaving ? And did you build Ian s Gay Jesus arc knowing that this is where it would lead to ? JOHN WELLS : It was very beautifully written and directed , so we were lucky to have that . And it s always just fun when you get to do those . We built the Gay Jesus story without knowing that Cameron might want to leave , but it dovetailed well into it when he decided that he wanted to take some time away from the show . I had an awareness of it as we started to plan out this season that he was thinking about doing some other things . We re still hopeful that he ll continue to do more as we go forward , but he s trying to decide what he wants to do next . When you ve been on a show for nine years and you started when you were 15 years old , I think there s a natural desire to want to leave your family you grow up with your family and wondering what the rest of the world looks like . But I m certainly hopeful that he ll want to continue to be on the show . I know all fans , including myself , were delighted with the final reveal of Mickey ( Noel Fisher ) and Ian being cellmates . From the moment Cameron said he was leaving , did you know that you had to try to get Noel ? Like , in your mind , was Mickey always the endgame for Ian ? Yeah , absolutely . We re as big of fans of that Mickey and Ian story as the fanbase is . We do it as much for us as we do it for the fans of the show , because they ve just been great together . It was a matter of trying to get into Noel s schedule . We love Noel , he s been a pleasure to work with , it s such a great character and so fun to write and we knew that people who enjoy the show would certainly respond to him being back . He was great to come back and do a day for us . Again , having done a number of these ensemble shows with wonderful casts , you cast talented people and then they ve got all these wonderful opportunities , so it s a regular challenge , but he was happy to do it . The last two episodes have seen Fiona s life fall apart , personally and professionally . You spent the last few years building her up and then just quickly tore her back down . What was appealing to you about that direction ? And was the trajectory of that affected at all by Emmy s decision to leave ? No , no . Emmy really agonized about what she wanted to do and so we were well into all this storytelling before she made a final decision that she was going to go . So , no , the idea was always that it s very difficult to break out of your social economic class in this country , even if we love to say that anybody can just pull themselves up by their bootstraps , it s much harder than that . And we felt that there was a certain amount of hubris with the character and that Fiona was beginning to fly a little too close to the sun and so we wanted to show how people get knocked back down . We re very excited in the second half of the season to explore that before Fiona actually leaves the show . So what should we expect for Fiona in Emmy s swan song ? I do n t know , how would you feel as a 28-year-old going back to live in your family house ? [ Laughs ] I think you can imagine that she s going to have some real struggles with what s happened to her , some anger and frustration . With of all the things that we satirize and the humor and the outrageousness , we try to show how family pulls together , because no matter how flawed we all are , family can be a huge part of what gets you through life . You can kind of anticipate that going forward . This season has two more episodes than all of the previous years and it s the first to be split in half , so what went into that decision and how did it affect the plotting of the season ? We did not know when we started writing or plotting the season that Showtime was actually going to separate the year . You will notice that we pick up pretty much only as if it s a few weeks after the end of episode 7 , so we really just approached it like one season . I can say that we re all sort of geared towards 12 episodes over here , which is pretty hilarious since I used to do 22 episodes all the time for broadcast network television , so we got around to episode 10 and realized that we had four more to go and we all kind of looked at each other like somebody had added eight more miles onto a marathon . I ended up writing the last two episodes for that reason , everyone was a little gassed . Going forward , I think we ll be doing 12 and my guess is that they d air in a row . One very random question : Will we ever find out what happened to Kassidi ? Or is that like your Russian in the Pine Barrens ? I frequently think , Wait , does Carl wonder if his wife is dead ? [ Laughs ] We have not yet resolved that question . She might actually be wandering off in the Pine Barrens somewhere we have n t decided . Shameless returns to Showtime on Jan. 20 at 9 p.m. ET . Read our full recap of Sunday s episode here .",

		"paragraph": "Tehran ( AFP ) - Iran unveiled its first domestic fighter jet on Tuesday , with President Hassan Rouhani insisting that Tehran 's military strength was only designed to deter enemies and was aimed at creating \" lasting peace \" . Images on state television showed Rouhani sitting in the cockpit of the new \" Kowsar \" fourth-generation fighter at the National Defence Industry exhibition in Tehran . State media said it had \" advanced avionics \" and multi-purpose radar , and that it was \" 100-percent indigenously made \" for the first time . Footage of the Kowsar 's test flights was circulated by various official media . But live footage of the plane taxiing along a runway at the defence show was cut before it took off . \" When I speak of our readiness to defend , it means we seek lasting peace . If we lack readiness , we welcome war , \" Rouhani said in a televised speech shortly after . \" Some think when we increase our military power , this means we seek war . ( But ) this is peace-seeking because we do n't war to happen , \" he added . \" If we do n't have a deterrent ... it gives a green light for others to enter this country . \" The plane was first publicly announced on Saturday by Defence Minister Amir Hatami , who had said it would be unveiled on Wednesday . He gave few details of the project , focusing instead on Iran 's efforts to upgrade its missile defences . Hatami said the defence programme was motivated by memories of the missile attacks Iran suffered during its eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s , and by repeated threats from Israel and the United States that \" all options are on the table \" in dealing with the Islamic republic . \" We have learned in the ( Iran-Iraq ) war that we can not rely on anyone but ourselves . Our resources are limited and we are committed to establishing security at a minimum cost , \" he said in a televised interview . The US has sold hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons to Iran 's regional rivals , but has demanded that Tehran curb its defence programmes , and is in the process of reimposing crippling sanctions in a bid to force its capitulation .",

He was promoting his new project , The Passage , on Thursday during the summer Television Critics Association press tour when his 11-year-old co-star Saniyya Sidney was asked if she had ever watched Gosselaar s popular teen sitcom . There s only one Zac that I know , Sidney said in response reportedly Zac Efron , according to USA Today . I m actually watching â€˜ Saved by the Bell right now , she said , per The Wrap . And Gosselaar is giving her tons of advice , because , as he jokingly put it to reporters at the event , I was n t a child performer â€¦ I was a child star . His biggest piece of advice to Sidney was simple : Just be a kid , and have fun , and enjoy your work . We re like Thelma and Louise . ...

		"paragraph": "In a surprise move to many fans cross the NFL , the Dallas Cowboys cut kicker Dan Bailey on Saturday afternoon , the best kicker in franchise history . Bailey has made the most field goals in Cowboys franchise history with 186 and is just the fourth Dallas kicker ever to make a Pro Bowl . He is also the second most-accurate kicker in NFL history , having made 88.2 percent of kicks in his seven-year career . The 30-year-old suffered a groin injury last season that sidelined him for four games . He returned for the final five games of the year , but struggled going 5-of-8 and missing the only two extra points of his career . Bailey had signed a seven-year , $ 22.5 million deal in 2014 , and had three years left on that deal . The move will save Dallas $ 3.4 million on its salary cap . Without Bailey , the Cowboys will go with Brett Maher , who has yet to kick in a regular-season game . The 28-year-old went undrafted out of Nebraska in 2013 , and has bounced around each offseason since . Maher has played in the CFL for the past four seasons , though , making 78.1 percent of his field goal attempts . He went 41-of-50 last season with the Ottawa Redblacks . The Kearney , Nebraska , native did drill a 57-yard field goal in the Cowboys final preseason game on Thursday .

		"paragraph": "ELMONT , N.Y. I paid off your student loans with my Kentucky Derby betting advice . I paid your mortgage with my Preakness picks . Now I m here to help you afford that time-share in Cabo with my five-star , stone-cold Belmont betting bonanza . Send pictures from the Gulf of California when you thank me . The premise remains the same as with the previous two Triple Crown races : Take $ 100 and turn it into a small fortune . Picking the winner of both ( Justify ) was relatively easy adding an exacta winner in the Derby ( Justify-Good Magic ) and the trifecta in the Preakness ( Justify-Bravazo-Tenfold ) made for a plump profit . Once again , the winner seems fairly obvious : Justify is the real deal , and he should be able to overcome the three things he has going against him to become the 13th Triple Crown winner . Drawing the No. 1 post is survivable with a clean break . It seems clear that trainer Bob Baffert wants jockey Mike Smith to send Justify to the lead out of the gate to avoid being pinned inside . Baffert said Thursday , I ll just tell him to watch the Big Brown race and leave it up to him . That was a reference to Big Brown s disastrous Belmont in 2008 when , chasing the Triple Crown , the horse got trapped early and never could settle into a smooth stride . Clearly , it wo n t be left up to Smith . The second element to overcome is simply the Triple Crown grind . Justify won the first two legs impressively , but they were n t easy races . He sat on a withering early pace in the Derby and hung on , then was pressed hard in the Preakness and barely staved off two fast-closing competitors . Both races were on sloppy tracks , increasing the difficulty . And the third element is the time-lapse nature of Justify s career . He did n t race at all until February , and will now be packing a sixth race into less than four months . That s a lot to ask of a modern thoroughbred , many of whom will race less than once a month . But the way Justify has looked since the Preakness is impressive , if not outright amazing . He s shown no sign of fatigue , no sign that he s not relishing going to the track every morning to gallop . He floated over the Belmont surface Thursday and Friday , looking the picture of vitality . This is what a trainer hopes to see the day before he runs , Baffert said Friday morning . A fast , dry track is expected Saturday . And while Justify won both the last two legs on sloppy tracks , he did n t need that to win . If anything , there should be less possibility for a fluke outcome on a dry racing surface . So I m rock-solid on Justify as the winner but just like the Preakness , there is n t much point in making a win bet . At morning-line odds of 4-5 , the wager wo n t pay . Make a $ 2 souvenir ticket win bet and use the other $ 98 in exotic wagers . The main bet will be a $ 1 trifecta , keying Justify on top and wheeling the field underneath . That s a Justify-all-all bet , in wagering parlance , and with nine other horses in the field it s a $ 56 outlay . That s a lot to bet with a 4-5 favorite on top , but the expectation is that longer shots will hit the board in what often is an unpredictable race at 1 miles . At least one horse at double-digit odds has finished in the top three in the last 10 Belmonts . After that , let s take a swing at the superfecta , which is the top four finishers . The play will be a $ 1 four-horse box for $ 24 : Justify with Preakness third-place finisher Tenfold ( 12-1 ) , Vino Rosso ( 8-1 ) and Hofburg ( 9-2 ) . The risk here is excluding Preakness runner-up Bravazo , but the hunch is that Bravazo ran his best race in Baltimore and is used up at this juncture . The last $ 18 will go in a $ 3 , three-horse exacta box : Justify with Tenfold and Vino Rosso . It wo n t pay a fortune if Justify wins , but if he places second or if Tenfold and Vino Rosso run 1-2 there will be a much better payout . With an odds-on favorite who looks hard to beat , this is n t a great betting race . But it s worth taking a swing at it while simultaneously watching Justify make history .

Kourtney Kardashian and model Younes Bendjima have split after nearly two years of dating , which , according to Instagram , was spent mostly on yachts in exotic locations . Multiple reports say the reality TV star was the one to jump ship . The two first met in Paris back in 2016 the night before sister Kim Kardashian infamously fell prey in a million-dollar robbery and have been together ever since , despite a not-so-warm reception from Kardashian s ex-boyfriend and father to her three children , Scott Disick . The relationship did n t end well , a source told People . And it s not hard to see why . Bendjima was photographed in Mexico on Monday looking mighty comfortable with another woman . However , he slammed reports that he was stepping out on Kardashian . They really want me to be the bad guy , he wrote on Instagram . Fuck your Hollywood bullshit , ca n t have fun with your friends no more . Enter Kardashian sisters Kim and Khloe , who put aside a family feud from earlier in the week and carved time out of their busy schedules to drag Bendjima on social media for the perceived slight to Kourtney . Alexa play heard it all before by Sunshine Anderson , Khloe wrote alongside a screenshot of Bendjima s Instagram Story posted by The Shade Room . Then Kim stepped in , writing , Nice pics from your boys trip . The cherry on top of the comment was a Pinnochio emoji .

In case you forgot , Kourtney slammed her family as gross and disgusting after sister Kim called her the least exciting to look at .

		"paragraph": "Another NBA legend who has been part of basketball fans lives since the mid-1990s has elected to walk away from the sport . First it was Kobe Bryant . Then it was Tim Duncan . And now it s Kevin Garnett s turn . [ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Basketball | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news ] Two days after ESPN.com s Marc Stein reported that Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves were in advanced discussions on a contract settlement expected to end the 40-year-old big man s second run with the Wolves , Kent Youngblood of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that an agreement s been reached , paving the way for one of the greatest players in NBA history to officially hang up his high-tops : Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical confirmed that it s all over but the shouting ( which , with KG , will likely never end ) : Later Friday , Garnett himself indicated that it s a wrap via Instagram : The agreement comes several days before the opening of training camp in what would have been Garnett s 22nd NBA season . As recently as Thursday , Wolves owner Glen Taylor said he did n t know whether Garnett who had n t suited up since late January , spending the balance of the season coaching , barking and helping guide the development of stars-in-the-making Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns intended to play again : What precipitated Garnett s quiet remains unclear . Sam Mitchell , Garnett s former teammate , longtime friend and the coach ousted to make room for Thibodeau , suggested that the nature of his departure might sway the famously loyal Garnett to decide not to return to the club , in something of a renewal of the strained relations that characterized his first separation from the team back in 2007 . Other reports have suggested that Garnett who agreed to the 2015 trade that sent him from the Brooklyn Nets back to Minnesota because longtime coach , friend and Timberwolves president of basketball operations Flip Saunders sold him on the move , and in part because he was interested in joining buying the team in the future lost his greatest ally in the organization after Saunders death last October following a battle with Hodgkin s lymphoma . From Jon Krawczynski of The Associated Press : While the circumstances of his second exit from Minnesota are n t yet clear , his impact on the game is anything but . It was through Garnett s sweat , energy , activity and borderline insanity that the expansion Timberwolves became a relevant NBA franchise , making the playoffs for eight straight seasons under the leadership of Garnett and Saunders , peaking in a 58-win campaign in 2003-04 during which Garnett averaged 24.2 points , 13.9 rebounds , 5.0 assists , 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals in 39.4 minutes per game , a season that would earn KG league MVP honors and see the Wolves advance to the Western Conference finals , falling two wins short of the championship round thanks to Shaquille O Neal , Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers . Despite Garnett s continued excellence , a diminished Wolves team never again reached that level . Three years later , a blockbuster trade to the Boston Celtics that reignited both player and team , with the troika of Garnett , Paul Pierce and Ray Allen and a brash , inscrutable young point guard named Rajon Rondo stomping to 66 wins and the 2008 NBA championship . He became an icon in Boston , developing an intense rapport with the city s fans â€¦ and with a particular clip from an old episode of American Bandstand that the Celtics game-ops crew would throw up on the JumboTron at TD Garden during Boston blowouts . Nobody enjoyed Gino Time quite like KG . Even last season , with the weight of more than 55,000 total regular - and postseason minutes on his legs , Garnett s all-time savvy , understanding of positioning and length still made a difference on defense . The Wolves who gave up 107.1 points per 100 possessions overall in 2015-16 , the fourth-worst mark in the league allowed just 96.4 points-per-100 with him on the court , and despite missing more than half the season , led the team in Defensive Box Plus-Minus , and ranked sixth in the whole league in ESPN s Defensive Real Plus-Minus statistic . He also remained a vocal leader in the Wolves locker room , a significant influence on the emerging talents on one of the NBA s youngest teams . From the looks of it , Towns did n t quite have the words to respond to Friday s update : It s hard to blame him . Kevin Garnett was the kind of player who d leave you speechless . A lithe , lanky live-wire of a prep star at Farragut Academy in Chicago , Garnett became the first high school player in two decades to leap directly to the NBA when the Wolves drafted him with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft . He would evolve into one of the defining players of his generation , a versatile offensive player of uncommon grace for his size and arguably the greatest defensive player of all time , owing to his ability to anchor the paint , protect the rim , pilot a zone at the top of the key , destroy pick-and-rolls all over the floor and communicate rotations so loud you could hear the calls from Fargo . He was one of the most intense competitors the sport has ever seen . Over the course of two decades in the NBA , Garnett experienced peaks and valleys . As Jared Wade wrote this week for FanSided , KG could be the best of us and the worst of us . [ Follow Dunks Do n t Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] He was also , as many who covered Garnett recalled on Friday , a stone-cold weirdo . Garnett exits the game having pulled down more defensive rebounds than any other player in NBA history , and ranks third in total minutes played , fifth in games played , 10th in total rebounds , 16th in steals , 17th in blocks , 20th on the all-time scoring list with 26,071 career points , and 47th on in assists . He finished in the top five in Most Valuable Player voting five times , winning once after that remarkable 2003-04 season with the Wolves won Defensive Player of the Year in 2007-08 with the Celtics and earned 15 All-Star berths , 12 All-Defensive Team nods and nine All-NBA selections . As is the case with Bryant and Duncan , Garnett will receive the VIP treatment from the brass at the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in Springfield , Mass. he will not have to wait in line for one single solitary second longer than dictated by rules for enshrinement among the game s immortals . That s the way it should be . Kevin Garnett changed the game in all sorts of ways , big and small and quiet and extremely , extremely loud he shook and shaped the sport , the way it s played now and the way it will be played in the future , and he did it with unrivaled fire . He was a work of art , a 1 of 1 . Lucky us , to have gotten him for as long as we did . Dan Devine is an editor for Ball Do n t Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

In December 2016 , the Queen 's granddaughter revealed that a pregnancy announced the previous month had ended in a miscarriage . Now she has told The Sunday Times Magazine that she suffered another miscarriage ' really early on ' before becoming pregnant with her daughter , Lena , who was born in June . \" I think you need to go through a period where you do n t talk about it because it 's too raw , \" she said in the joint interview alongside her brother , Peter Phillips . \" But , as with everything , time 's a great healer . \" Zara , 37 , and her husband Mike welcomed their first child , Mia , in 2014 .

		"paragraph": "Is it a passing storm or an existential problem ? That s a key question for the NFL as it grapples with the mushrooming controversy of players kneeling in protest during the national anthem , and President Donald Trump s persistent bashing of the kneelers . A new Yahoo Finance poll suggests the NFL has an enduring problem on its hands . Nearly 62 % of 9,056 respondents told us they plan to watch less pro football in response to the anthem controversy . Thirty-six percent said they plan to buy less NFL merchandise , and 32 % have chosen not to attend a game they would otherwise have gone to . Those findings all have financial implications for the NFL and its 32 team owners . We wanted to limit our survey , conducted online via SurveyMonkey from Sept. 28-29 , to people who patronize the NFL , and exclude people who have an opinion but do n t watch football . So we only counted answers from people who describe themselves as pro football fans . Eighty-eight percent of respondents said they watch at least one game per week , with 46 % of those saying they watch more than two games . ( Here are the full survey results . The number of responses varies from question to question because some respondents skipped questions or were directed further down the survey based on answers they gave . A note about the results : In Question 9 , 80 % of respondents said they plan to watch less football on TV . But that s only among people who answered yes to Question 8 , asking if they have changed their behavior . When including the people who answered no to Question 8 , the portion saying they plan to watch less football drops to 62 % . ) The NFL s anthem controversy is becoming one of the most divisive social issues in recent years , with Trump s comments fanning the flames . Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kicked off the protests last year , when he began kneeling during the anthem to protest police brutality . A few other players followed his lead , but the kneelers were a sideshow and football was mostly about football . The issue divides fans at least as much as it divides players . In a recent Seton Hall Poll , 84 % of respondents said they support the players right to protest . But only 35 % said kneeling during the anthem was the right way to do it . In the Yahoo Finance survey , we asked specifically if people felt it was wrong for players to kneel during the anthem . Seventy-seven percent said yes , 20 % said no and just 2 % said they were n t sure . ( The numbers do n t add to 100 because of rounding . ) In our survey , we wanted to suss out whether the anthem flap could deal a lasting financial hit to the NFL . The answers suggest it could . When we asked fans if the controversy would make them more or less supportive of the NFL , 71 % said less and only 15 % said more . Of those who said they are now less supportive , 74 % said their change of heart was permanent , and only 3 % said they felt it was temporary . Public attitudes are fickle , and it s entirely possible boredom with the issue or terrifically exciting football could make people forget before long . The NFL , after all , has faced other disturbing issues that did n t seem to dent its popularity . We promoted our survey on the Yahoo Finance home page , and on our Twitter and Facebook accounts . So responses reflect the characteristics of the Yahoo Finance audience , which skews more toward wealthier white males than the broader population . But that may actually be worse news for the NFL , especially since a startling majority of respondents in our survey show a striking disregard for the future of the league . When asked their view if the anthem flap were to cause the NFL lasting harm , 47 % said they d be pleased and 30 % said they would n t care . Only 10 % said it would bother them . For football fans , it once seemed hard to imagine life in America without the NFL . Some fans seem to be rethinking that . Confidential tip line : rickjnewman@yahoo.com .

		"paragraph": "SAN ANTONIO ( AP ) -- Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers nearly made Spurs coach Gregg Popovich ill . Oladipo had 21 points , Indiana had 34 assists and the Pacers led for all but the opening seconds in a 116-96 victory over San Antonio on Wednesday night . Popovich joked before the game that San Antonio 's defense might land him in the emergency room . Oladipo and the sharp-shooting Pacers had no trouble finding space to fire away . '' We moved the ball , '' Oladipo said . '' I think when we move the ball , it kind of translates to being in unison and being together on the defensive end as well . When everybody feels good , everybody 's touching ( the ball ) , everybody wants to defend . '' The Pacers limited the Spurs to 6-for-19 shooting on 3-pointers while leading by as many as 29 points . Defense has been the foundation of San Antonio 's five NBA Championships and 21 straight postseason appearances , but they are struggling to maintain that consistency with an overhauled roster . '' We have a lot of work to do on both ends of the court , and we know that , especially defensively , '' Popovich said . '' We 're defensively challenged , so to speak . Until we figure it out , there 's a lot of habits that have to be formed . '' Seven Pacers scored in double figures , including 19 points by Tyreke Evans and 16 by Domantas Sabonis . Oladipo led the team with nine assists , and nine others had at least one . '' When you have that type of ball movement , you 're hitting guys and you 're making the defense work and you 're playing to your third and fourth option , '' Indiana coach Nate McMillan said . '' A lot of times , you 're going to get some open looks , and they can shoot the ball when they 're open . '' DeMar DeRozan had 18 points to lead the Spurs , his lowest total since joining the team in an offseason trade from Toronto . Marco Belinelli added 16 points and LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes had 15 each . DeRozan said the Spurs are still adapting to one another . '' Communication thing , understanding spots , understanding tendencies , understanding terminology , '' DeRozan said of what the team needs to work on . '' It 's kind of a little bit of everything . It 's a new group , we still have n't gotten rolling offensively like we want , and defensively as well . So , once we get both them two things clicking , we 're going to be all right . '' The Pacers dominated with a strong combination of inside muscle and outside shooting . Indiana shot 53 percent on 3-pointers , opening the game 9 for 11 on 3s . Sabonis also had a monstrous dunk against Spurs forward Davis Bertans early in the second quarter , winding up and dunking with his left hand around the reach of a leaping Bertans . The Spurs only lead came when Rudy Gay scored the game 's opening points on an 11-foot fadeaway jumper . Gay finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds . TIP-INS Pacers : Indiana entered the game second in the NBA by shooting 43 percent on 3-pointers . ... The Pacers held an opponent under 100 points for the second time this season . Spurs : Forbes is the first starting point guard for the Spurs other than Tony Parker to score in double figures in each of his first four games since Maurice Cheeks in 1989 . ... The Spurs played their 1,700 th game in San Antonio . They are 1,270-429 at home , which is the best home record of any team in league history . EASY CHOICE Popovich had high praise for McMillan , who will be one of his assistants when the Spurs ' veteran coach leads Team USA . '' He 's a class act from top to bottom , '' Popovich said of McMillan . '' He 's knowledgeable , he 's really experienced in USA Basketball , he 's got great demeanor , he 's very , very well respected and ... I think that 's enough . I think those are all pretty good reasons why I was hoping he would agree to do it , so , I was thrilled when he decided he would do it . '' STILL EARLY Oladipo is not reading too much into the Spurs ' early struggles defensively . '' It 's a new year , '' Oladipo said . '' It 's only the fourth , fifth game of the year . So , you as a media , you 've got to kind of analyze all that , but them as players and coaching staff , they 've just got to keep getting better and they 'll be fine .

		"paragraph": "EL SEGUNDO , Calif. ( AP ) Rob Pelinka says the Los Angeles Lakers are n't trying to beat the Golden State Warriors at their own game . Instead , they 're building a team around LeBron James to do something different . Pelinka spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since the Lakers ' remarkable offseason overhaul began , and the irrepressibly optimistic former agent radiated excitement about the future for a team that has n't made the playoffs in five seasons . \" To get the commitment from LeBron James to come to the Lakers for four years was really the culmination of everything we 've been working towards , \" Pelinka said . \" When LeBron chose to come here , it was the ultimate validation for the moves we 've made and what we 've been building since we started . \" The longest postseason drought in franchise history could be finished after James chose the Lakers in free agency . The club also added veterans Rajon Rondo , JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson alongside their young core while parting ways with Julius Randle and Brook Lopez , among others . Pelinka and top executive Magic Johnson hope the result is a sturdy , defense-minded team with enough up-tempo offense to trouble the Warriors , the Houston Rockets and every other contender for the title . \" I think to try to play the Warriors at their own game is a trap , \" Pelinka said . \" No one is going to beat them at their own game , so that is why we wanted to add these elements of defense and toughness and depth and try to look at areas where we will have an advantage . \" Pelinka said the Lakers focused their free agency recruitment efforts on versatile , playoff-tested talents who can score and defend , instead of looking for elite players with only one specialty . He hopes the result will be a flexible , dangerous team under coach Luke Walton and a different look around James , whose Cleveland Cavaliers teams often looked like a collection of perimeter shooters whose deficiencies were exposed by Golden State and others . Pelinka praised Rondo as a gritty guard whose championship pedigree will fill a void on the roster . He also described Stephenson as providing \" an extreme toughness and an edge , \" comparing his skills to Dennis Rodman 's contributions to Michael Jordan 's Chicago Bulls , or Metta World Peace 's work with Kobe Bryant 's late-career Lakers . \" The road to the NBA championship has to go through the team that won last year , and we all know the guys up north have a special group , \" Pelinka said . \" But one of the ways to attack what they have is with defensive toughness . I think we saw that in the Houston series with some of the players that Houston has . \" Pelinka 's desire for flexibility extended to the payroll as well . After years of trading away draft picks and acquiring high-priced veterans in an effort to win now with Bryant , the Lakers were overextended until Pelinka and Johnson spent the past 16 months creating enough salary cap space to sign two elite free agents . They only got one , although the Lakers still appear to be in contention for disgruntled San Antonio star Kawhi Leonard , who has a year left on his contract with the Spurs . No matter what happens , Pelinka said the Lakers ' series of one-year contracts around James will put them in position to have ample cap space again next summer , when several stars could be available to join James . Pelinka said the Lakers will have \" an open training camp \" in September , with only James guaranteed to be a starter . That means Rondo and second-year pro Lonzo Ball will compete to be Los Angeles ' starting point guard , a possibility that was welcomed by Rondo after he signed . Pelinka also said Ball will be fully healthy for training camp . The point guard has a torn meniscus in his left knee . Pelinka 's idiosyncrasies shone through again Wednesday , with the GM beginning his news conference by reading a passage from Brazilian author Paulo Coelho 's \" The Alchemist , \" a book recommended to him by former client Bryant and carried by James throughout the playoffs . The passage describes the process of making a decision being \" only the beginning of things . \" \" Hopefully it will lead to things ... happening that are bigger than our dreams could ever imagine , \" Pelinka said .

		"paragraph": "Stephen Curry turned 27 years old on Saturday . The Golden State Warriors ' superstar point guard got a few very cool gifts , like this birthday cake shaped like the trophy he received after winning the Three-Point Shootout at All-Star Weekend last month : [ DraftKings : FREE entry to huge cash Fantasy Basketball Contest with first deposit ] ... and a special , festive birthday-themed edition of his Under Armour signature sneakers , titled the \" Splash Party \" Curry One : ... and , of course , the greatest gift any professional basketball player could receive right now a home game against the woeful New York Knicks . And yet , as the action got underway at Oracle Arena on Saturday , Curry seemed less interested in receiving gifts than in giving them to Warriors center Andrew Bogut . Here , ya big Aussie , have a behind-the-back pass for a dunk : Heck , while we 're at it , how about a hook pass for an alley-oop finish ? Steph 's treat : [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] But while the Warriors started loading up the highlight reel early , the matchup between the teams with the best and worst records in the NBA got off to something of an unexpected start , as New York rode the backcourt of Langston Galloway and Alexey Shved to a 27-26 lead at the end of the first quarter . The universe righted itself at the start of the second , though , as Golden State 's second unit Andre Iguodala , David Lee , Shaun Livingston , Marreese Speights and Justin Holiday ripped off a 12-0 run to put the Warriors in front . They 'd never trail again . With coach Steve Kerr reinserting his starters into the lineup as the frame wore on , the Dubs would inflate the lead in the home stretch of the second quarter . After a 2-for-7 start to the game , Curry began to find his rhythm , thanks in part to the Knicks ' hapless defense and in part to on-time feeds like this behind-the-back dish to the corner by Livingston : With the Warriors leading by 20 in the closing seconds of the quarter , Bogut broke out his present for his point guard a home-run inbounds pass that led to a halftime-buzzer-beating 28-foot triple that blew the roof off of Oracle and capped a 45-point second quarter and 73-point first half for the home team : It 's always nice to get gifts from your teammates , but sometimes , it 's even better to make like Tom and Donna . Treat yo self , Steph , with English : Not to be outdone , the ever-thoughtful Knicks gave Curry the opportunity to enjoy the gift of his adoring public by first giving up the basketball and then giving chase just hard enough to send him into the stands at Oracle : Curry , thankfully , was none the worse for wear after his header , and with the Warriors holding a staggering 111-73 lead after three quarters , his services were n't required for the final 12 minutes . Neither , for the matter , were those of any of his fellow starters , as a reserve-filled final stanza put an all-over-but-the-shoutin ' end to Golden State 's 124-95 domination of the visiting Knicks . The birthday boy finished with 25 points on 8-for-15 shooting , including a 6-for-10 mark from 3-point land , to go with 11 assists , three rebounds , three steals and just one turnover in 27 minutes of playing time as he turned 27 . For the final word on just how good he was , we turn to the ever-quotable mom of Warriors forward Draymond Green : Splash Brother Klay Thompson led the way with 27 points ( 9-for-17 from the field , 6-for-10 from 3 ) in 25 1/2 minutes for the Warriors , who improved their best-in-the-West mark to 52-13 , and now boast a 29-2 record within the friendly confines of Oracle Arena . Andrea Bargnani scored 18 points to lead five players in double figures for the Knicks , who fell to 13-52 and now , at long last , can start thinking about the lottery : Oh , well . At least you helped make a nice young man happy on his birthday , Knicks . That 's got to count for something . - - - - - - - Dan Devine is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "With just weeks to go before daughter Olympia celebrates her first birthday , Serena Williams is opening up about how motherhood has changed her life . The tennis champion is gracing the cover of the latest issue of Time , in which she weighs in on balancing motherhood with a career , feeling guilty about using a waist trainer to get back into shape after giving birth , and marrying nerd Alexis Ohanian in November . I always assumed I d marry a black guy , Williams says about her marriage to the Reddit co-founder , who keeps a PlayStation near their daughter s playpen . I always felt that I could relate more with a black guy , that we d have more struggles in common , you know ? But the couple have found domestic bliss and try to maintain a work-life balance by ditching their cell phones on Sunday . Raising a baby while keeping up her tennis training the 36-year-old made it to the Wimbledon women s final in July , just months after giving birth is a more challenging , and emotionally wrenching , matter . That s meant no longer breastfeeding her 11-month-old , on the advice of tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou . It s absolutely hard to take from a guy , Williams told Time about giving up her magical superpower ahead of the French Open . He s not a woman , he does n t understand that connection , that the best time of the day for me was when I tried to feed her . I ve spent my whole life making everyone happy , just servicing it seems like everyone . And this is something I wanted to do . I felt the decisions were taken through the angle of the family , where before every decision was taken through the angle of tennis , Mouratoglou told the magazine . This is a big difference . Even if you are Serena , if you want to be successful in tennis , tennis has to be priority No. 1 . Ultimately , Williams acquiesced after talking it out with Olympia . Weeks later , she was in the Wimbledon finals , inspiring moms the world over . I dedicated that to all the moms out there who ve been through a lot , she told Time of her post-baby comeback . Some days , I cry . I m really sad . I ve had meltdowns . It s been a really tough 11 months . If I can do it , you guys can do it too . Williams who was on bed rest for six weeks after Olympia s birth , following blood clots and a large hematoma also spoke of her insecurity about doing right by her daughter . Sometimes she just wants Mommy , she does n t want anyone else , she said . I still have to learn a balance of being there for her , and being there for me . I m working on it . I never understood women before , when they put themselves in second or third place . And it s so easy to do . It s so easy to do . I did n t think I d be this attached , she added . It s difficult to leave her . And yet tennis is still hugely important . I need to be more selfish for just those couple of days , she said about prepping for a recent match . I keep telling myself she s not going to remember that I spent an extra two hours with her . I should be taking that two hours and focusing on my career . Bottom line : I m not done yet , simple â€¦ my story does n t end here .

		"paragraph": "Lucky Stars of Rio : â€˜ Shot Diva first American woman to win shot put | Bolt makes history | U.S. win gold medal No. 1,000 RIO DE JANEIRO When he returns to football practice at Oregon later this month , multi-sport star Devon Allen will have one heck of a story to tell his teammates . His Olympic experience . Allen took fifth place in the 110-meter hurdles on Tuesday night , holding his own against a powerful field that included Jamaica s Omar McLeod and Spain s Orlando Ortega . The 21-year-old Oregon senior s time of 13.31 was 0.26 seconds slower than gold-medal winner McLeod , who finished in 13.05 . Ortega took the silver ( 13.17 ) and France s Dimitri Bascou took the bronze ( 13.24 ) . Aside from the 1980 boycott , it s the first time an American has failed to medal in the 110-meter hurdles at a Summer Olympics Games . In an era of specialization in sports , Allen stands out as an exception , the rare athlete capable of juggling two sports without harming his performance in either . The 21-year-old has emerged as an NFL wide receiver prospect and a world-class hurdler thanks to his unusual blend of exceptional speed , unshakable confidence and relentless work ethic . Devon is amazing , fellow American hurdler Ronnie Ash said . The fact that he can compete at a high level in football , then turn around and hurdle ? It s spectacular . You do n t see it that much . You ve got a couple guys who have done it at the high school level . Not really at the height he s done it . When Allen zoomed across the finish line on Tuesday night , this was no disappointment . The two-time NCAA champion established himself as a contender in Rio at the U.S. Olympic Trials last month , where his winning time of 13.03 seconds was the second-fastest in the world this year behind only McLeod . The morning after he took first place at the Olympic Trials last month , Allen dropped by the Oregon football office . He wanted an advance copy of the playbook so that he could help the walk-on who would be taking his spot in practice at wide receiver while he was preparing to compete in Rio . That shows how he thinks , Oregon offensive coordinator Matt Lubick said . He just won the Trials and he s already thinking of someone else . He s always putting his teammates first . Allen s brilliance on the track this summer will leave him with a difficult choice to make when he returns home from Rio . He ll have to decide whether now is the right time to turn pro in track . Endorsement contracts are a primary source of income in professional track , but Allen would render himself ineligible to play college football anymore if he signed with a corporate sponsor . The only way he can turn pro in track and still play football at Oregon would be to hire a track-only agent and solely accept prize money . [ Featured : There was a group of athletes that were pro-drugs Edwin Moses ] Allen insists he s undecided , yet he does n t sound like someone ready to give up either sport anytime soon . There s a good chance he ll transition back to playing wide receiver for Oregon after the Olympics and then take a hard look at his future in both sports once the football season is over . If anyone has a chance [ to keep doing both ] , I have one of the best , Allen said Monday . I m trying to block it out and focus on running fast here and winning a gold medal . I ll worry about that later . Switching between the sports comes naturally to Allen because he has been doing it since high school . He typically sheds about 8 to 10 pounds during track season and then puts it back on in the weight room for football . The biggest threat to Allen s future in either sport was the torn knee ligaments he suffered returning the opening kickoff of the Rose Bowl against Florida State about 20 months ago . He pasted on a smile after the game and beat doctors estimates by returning in time for the 2015 football season . But it became clear that he lacked the explosiveness he showed during a breakout campaign the previous winter . While Allen recorded just nine receptions for 91 yards and did not attempt a return last season , he found other ways to contribute . He became Oregon s best downfield blocker and a team leader in the locker room . Over the course of the track season , Allen s speed gradually returned . He won the NCAA 110 hurdles title despite clipping four or five hurdles in the final , and then he ran a much cleaner race at the Olympic Trials to outclass a loaded field and clinch a spot in Rio . I do n t like to speak about that race too much , but I could better competition , Ash said with a smile . He got out on me that day . One of the fun aspects of the buildup to Rio for Allen has been the support he has received from his football teammates and coaches . They donned Team Allen shirts at Hayward Field during the Olympic Trials . They sent him dozens of good luck texts and tweets this week . And they altered their practice schedule Monday and Tuesday so they could watch Allen s races together on the big screen in the team meeting room . I was trying to give those guys a shout-out on NBC while they were watching , Allen said . It means a lot for them to take the time to watch me . The race the Ducks football players witnessed Allen run on Monday night was not his smoothest . He advanced to the semifinals despite experiencing pre-race nerves during a rain delay , failing to clear several hurdles cleanly and then chopping his steps before the seventh hurdle to compensate for getting out of rhythm . Allen had to run cleaner on Tuesday night , and he nearly delivered a medal finishing just 0.07 off the podium . Now he s coming back to Oregon with an experience he ll never forget . ",

In reality , more than a dozen people have accused Mr Trump of sexual assault or harassment . The president has denied all the charges . I 've had a lot of false charges against me , Mr Trump said . In the press conference , Mr Trump also claimed that he won the women 's vote , at 52 per cent , in the 2016 general election . In fact , Hilary Clinton won the women 's vote . With this false statistic , the president is presumably referring to the white women 's vote , which he did indeed win . Mr Kavanaugh s likely ascension to the highest court in America . Firstly , Dr Christine Blasey Ford accused Mr Kavanaugh of trying to force himself upon her during a party while the two were in high school . Then Deborah Ramirez accused Mr Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while both were students at Yale University . On Wednesday , Mr Kavanaugh dismissed a third woman 's accusation against him of misconduct as ridiculous .

In a statement , the judge said he did not know the accuser , Julie Swetnick , and her allegations never happened . Mr Trump praised Kavanaugh at the news conference , but in answer to a question he said he could consider changing his mind on the nomination if testimony by Kavanaugh-accuser Dr Ford is totally convincing . He said of the allegations by her and others , If I thought he was guilty of something like this ... yeah , sure . Republican leaders indicated they were still determined to have the committee vote on recommending Kavanaugh on Friday after a dramatic Thursday hearing at which both Mr Kavanaugh and Dr Ford , are to testify .

		"paragraph": "PARIS ( AP ) Just as Rafael Nadal was two points from pulling even at a set apiece in his surprisingly intriguing French Open quarterfinal Wednesday - just as he finally was playing like , well , Rafael Nadal - the match was suspended because of rain . So both Nadal , the 10-time champion at Roland Garros , and 11th-seeded Diego Schwartzman , attempting to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time , were given a night to rest before they are scheduled to resume Thursday at Court Philippe Chatrier . When they return to the stadium , Nadal will be serving at 5-3 , 30-15 in the second set . Schwartzman took the opener 6-4 , ending Nadal 's streak of winning 37 consecutive completed sets at the clay-court major . During the ensuing changeover , the left-handed Nadal was treated by a trainer , who applied white tape to both of the No. 1-ranked Spaniard 's wrists . In the other remaining quarterfinal , which will continue Thursday at Court Suzanne Lenglen , No. 3 Marin Cilic and No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro were at 5-all in a first-set tiebreaker when the play-ending shower came . Both men 's matches already had been interrupted by rain once . For Nadal , that happened when he was down a break at 3-2 in the second set , and the delay of a little less than an hour seemed to help him begin to change course against Schwartzman , a 5-foot-7 ( 1.70-meter ) Argentine who was putting nearly every shot right where he wanted to in the early stages . Nadal was far from his usual impeccable self on red clay , too . He hit only four winners in the first set , none with his backhand , while Schwartzman produced 20 in that span . Nadal was broken five of the first eight times he served . This is a guy who entered the day 5-0 against Schwartzman , having won 12 of their sets . Looking at the bigger picture , Nadal had n't ceded a set in Paris since 2015 , when he lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals . The following year , Nadal won a pair of straight-set matches before withdrawing with an injured tendon in his left wrist . And last year , he earned the trophy without dropping a set . The 37-set run was Nadal 's longest at the French Open , where the record of 41 was established by Bjorn Borg from 1978-81 . More important than that , of course , is the match 's ultimate outcome , and a significant moment came with Schwartzman serving while up 3-2 in the second after the initial delay . Nadal hit a floater that was possibly headed wide , yet Schwartzman attempted a volley that missed . It gave Nadal a break point he converted when Schwartzman sailed a forehand long . Nadal pumped his fist and yelled : '' Vamos ! Vamos ! Vamos ! '' ( Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! ) That was part of a 15-minute roll of three consecutive games for Nadal , a wave during which he collected 13 of 15 points to close in on that set . He was unable to finish the job before the weather made him wait .",

		"paragraph": "We ve gained a little insight into LeBron James personal life . Apparently his idea of a honeymoon involves a very public show of baseball player cosplay . [ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry ] [ Follow Dunks Do n t Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] The Cleveland Cavaliers star entered Friday night s game with the Chicago Bulls by cashing in on a World Series bet made with pal Dwyane Wade , walking into Chicago s United Center while wearing a Chicago Cubs uniform at the behest of Cub-fan Wade , after James Cleveland team lost in seven games to the Cubs in the World Series ( note : neither of these players really roots for either of those teams ) . That entrance was followed by a close but eventual defeat at the hands of Wade s Bulls , with LeBron offering 27 points , 13 assists and five rebounds but also eight turnovers in what turned into the Cavs third straight defeat , by a 111-105 score . Following the contest , one that saw the 34-year old Wade routinely beating James in plays off the dribble , LeBron was distressed in talking to Dave McMenamin at ESPN and others following the loss in Chicago s West Side : Yes . Yes we will . Kindly go on : As McMenamin noticed , it was n t as if LeBron James was unaware of the run heading into Friday night , following the Cavs loss to the Los Angeles Clippers : Given the three game stretch , which also included a loss to the Bucks , it is a true sentiment . The Cavaliers do need to improve their play . The team , currently stuck at 13-5 , is now only on pace for 60 wins , and it s only a half game up in the East on the Toronto Raptors team the Cavs easily handled during last year s Eastern Conference finals . The whirlwind is unimaginable , and we hope the Cavs have it in them to work through the storm and stress . [ | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news ] Cleveland had its chances against Chicago , but the Bulls pulled away in the second half after both teams gave defense a wave from afar through the first 24 minutes of close action . Wade notched 24 points on 23 shots , and Bulls swingman Jimmy Butler offered 26 points with eight rebounds and six assists with three steals and two blocks . Big man Taj Gibson , who made his first eight shots , was the team s MVP with 23 points , 11 rebounds and five assists in the win , which pulled the Bulls to 11-7 following a disappointing loss to the short-handed Lakers on Wednesday . Taking a page out of Cleveland s book , the Bulls were able to spread the floor and create unorthodox driving lanes throughout the second half . Though he hit for one clutch three-pointer in the fourth quarter , Cavs star Kevin Love struggled overall to contain Gibson , while missing nine of 14 shots overall . I was bad tonight , Love semi-correctly concluded following the game . The contest was Cleveland s fourth in six nights , with the lone win coming against a miserable Philadelphia 76ers squad . Cavs coach Tyronn Lue , via McMenamin , reminded his team that the sub-standard play will happen again if the team enters Toronto and New York ( its two upcoming opponents ) with the same somewhat languorous mindset . And ? The Cavs are n t happy , but these are the sorts of runs that tend to fall in line during a champ s title defense . Not every team can be the 1996-97 Bulls or 2008-09 Boston Celtics , squads that started the year 17-1 and 27-2 respectively , and it is n t as if the Cavs got off to a decidedly poor start in 2016-17 . The honeymoon carried over from the team s first NBA championship clearly did n t affect its rollin ways throughout the first 15 games of the season , which included 13 victories . It has n t gotten in the way of James brilliant season , Kyrie Irving s emerging brilliance , or Love s potent ( if maddeningly inconsistent , especially when he s relegated to a role that does n t suit him ) shot-making . Alas , LeBron said it so we ll use the headline . And when he wants to pack up and leave a few days early , feeling as if the rain is coming , you best listen .

		"paragraph": "If you spend any time perusing NBA Twitter , you 've probably seen a meme taken from Kevin Durant 's MVP speech last spring in which his Oklahoma City Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook stares at the trophy intently from his seat . The idea is that Westbrook is so competitive and focused that he ca n't help but lust after the NBA 's most prestigious individual accolade even when the spotlight is on a friend . He 's an obsessive . If Westbrook keeps up his current play , the joke might become reality in just a few months . As the Thunder look to hold onto and improve their playoff position with Durant hobbled , Westbrook has stepped into the role of primary superstar without issue and played at a level that has put him right next to Stephen Curry and James Harden among the league 's top three MVP candidates . Always an All-Star but often a target for criticism , the electric Westbrook has transcended doubts about his game in recent weeks to reach another level of stardom . [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] His amazing run of form continued in Tuesday night 's home game vs. the Indiana Pacers . Westbrook notched a triple-double ( his third of the season ) by the end of the third quarter ( and did n't even enter the game in the fourth ) to finish with 20 points , 11 rebounds , and 10 assists over just 28 minutes in the Thunder 's 105-92 win . Here 's a look at some of his best moments : OKC still has games at the Phoenix Suns on Thursday and at the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday to finish out the month , but Westbrook is having a truly fantastic February . In 10 games , he is averaging 29.5 points , 10.0 assists , and 8.2 rebounds in a not-especially-heavy 34.1 minutes per game . ( He also won MVP honors at the All-Star Game , if that matters to you . ) Plus , Westbrook has done this as Durant has missed six games with his ongoing foot problems . For all intents and purposes , Westbrook has kept the team afloat during this period they are 9-1 in February , 2 1/2 games ahead of the New Orleans Pelicans for the West 's final playoff spot , and within striking distance of the San Antonio Spurs to move up in the standings . Whether these accomplishments add up to an MVP season depends on many factors , including OKC 's final record , Westbrook 's final stats , the effectiveness of Durant when he returns from injury , and the ongoing performances and finishes of Curry and Harden . For that matter , Westbrook has n't assuaged all concerns ( misplaced or not ) that he 's too volatile to succeed , because certain wo n't be satisfied until he wins several championships , if even then . Nevertheless , this month has served as a convincing statement on his abilities . When called upon , Westbrook is perfectly capable of serving as the Thunder 's primary scorer and facilitator . He 's as essential to the franchise 's title hopes as is his co-star . Who knows , maybe Durant will be the one sneaking a peak at Westbrook 's hardware in a few months . - - - - - - - Eric Freeman is a writer for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

The NOA stems from an NCAA re-investigation into the widespread academic fraud allegations at the university . We take these allegations very seriously , and we will carefully evaluate them to respond within the NCAA s 90-day deadline , a joint statement from chancellor Carol Folt and athletic director Bubba Cunningham said . The University will publicly release the NCAA s notice as soon as possible . The notice is lengthy and must be prepared for public dissemination to ensure we protect privacy rights as required by federal and state law . When that review for redactions is complete , the University will post the notice on the Carolina Commitment website and notify the news media . When we respond to the NCAA s allegations , we will follow this same release process . The NCAA re-opened its investigation into North Carolina in June . The previous investigation was closed in 2012 and resulted in sanctions for the football team . The team was banned from playing in a bowl in 2012 . Coach Butch Davis was fired in 2011 and athletic director Dick Baddour resigned around the same time . The team was also forced to vacate wins from the 2008 and 2009 seasons . The basketball team could be penalized as part of the new investigation . 10 of the 15 players on North Carolina 's NCAA title-winning 2005 team majored in African and Afro-American Studies , the department which much of the academic fraud allegations has centered around . According to an independent report published in October , academic counselors pushed over 3,000 students approximately half of them athletes into sham classes that were designed to keep athletes eligible over a period of 18 years . The report said 81 students got a grade from the so-called paper classes in the African and Afro-American Studies department high enough to push their GPA to above 2.0 . Last January , a former UNC football player said the academic environment at the school was a scam .

		"paragraph": "International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde is a big fan of the corporate tax reform bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last year . In fact , the IMF chief , who has been critical of many of the policies Trump has pursued , said the organization was very , very supportive of the tax cut . During a press briefing at the IMF/World Bank s spring meeting in Washington , Lagarde called the tax cut something the IMF had advocated , recommended , encouraged , and one [ thing ] that we are very pleased to see happen . Lagarde was responding to a question from a reporter about whether she could name anything that Trump had done right , given his policies conflict with much of the IMF s guidance . The Fund is an international organization which seeks to encourage global cooperation , global financial stability and facilitate international trade . Its stated goal is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system . The IMF raised its expectations for global growth this year from 3.7 % to 3.9 % , the highest since 2011 , and increased its U.S. growth projection to 2.9 % for 2018 . Lagarde said the measures taken by the Trump administration and Congress were largely behind the upgrade . Lagarde added , however , that she remained concerned about the debt the United States has been taking on since Trump took office . On the other hand , what we are saying is that in order to deal with entitlements the United States should take advantage of the current upswing â€¦ given the measures that have been taken , she said . So taking advantage of this upswing we believe that the United States should try to reduce its deficit and try to move its debt downward rather than upward . That s all we are saying in that respect . More from the IMF/World Bank meetings : Dion Rabouin is a markets reporter for Yahoo Finance . Follow him on Twitter : @DionRabouin .

		"paragraph": "It has been a rough start for Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden this season and it does n t seem to be getting easier . The Raiders were fined $ 20,000 on Thursday for violating the NFL s injury report policy after they failed to downgrade offensive lineman Kelechi Osemele from questionable to out in Week 5 before their game against the Los Angeles Chargers . Osemele did not travel with the team to Los Angeles , and has been dealing with a lingering knee injury he sustained the week before against the Cleveland Browns . He also did not play against the Seahawks last week , though he made the trip with the team to London . Gruden has led the Raiders to a 1-5 start this season , drawing harsh criticism from fans in his short time with the team especially after he traded star linebacker Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears . According to USA Today , the NFL is also investigating the Miami Dolphins for a similar infraction . The team said that quarterback Ryan Tannehill suffered a shoulder injury in Week 5 against the Cincinnati Bengals , but was listed as a full participant shortly after . However , head coach Adam Gase said that Brock Osweiler took first-team reps Thursday , meaning that Tannehill should have been listed as limited , according to the report . Tannehill did not play in the Dolphins win over the Bears last weekend , and has been ruled out for Miami s game against Detroit on Sunday .

In 2012 , heappeared on Parks and Recreation and ranted for eight minutes straight , outlining his brilliantly detailed plot for a Star Wars-Marvel crossover film . On Saturday , Oswalt knocked around a theory about The Dark Knight specifically about the origin of Heath Ledger s Joker . The 2008 film explains almost nothing about where the character came from , but somefans have theorized that because of his fighting style and familiarity with weapons , the Joker is a war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . Oswalt takes that idea further and asks , What if he s not only ex-military , but ex-military intelligence ? This theory makes a lot of sense and adds clarity to some of the Joker s lines throughout the film . For example , he says of one character , I know the squealers when I see them . Or the scene in the police interrogation room where Batman slams the Joker s head on the table , and the villain says , Never start with the head . The victim gets all fuzzy . The Dark Knight , for which Ledger posthumously won an Oscar , celebrates its 10th anniversary this year .

It was n t until two whole years later that he discovered the rejection was in fact completely fabricated . The letter he had received had n t come from the school but his girlfriend at the time , Jennifer Lee . Fearing her boyfriend would leave her for the US , Jennifer sabotaged the application and even comforted him when he did n t get in . Earlier this week , a superior court judge ruled that Jennifer should pay AUD$ 381,760 in compensation . He said that it was for despicable interference in such an incredible career opportunity . To find out it was the person who I had trusted the most and loved , was a simultaneous stab to the back and the heart , Eric told The Guardian . It was a very crushing feeling . I was so driven and really wanted it . I was very disappointed about it and feeling down after I got the rejection . It was only months later that both the tutor and Eric met at an audition and asked why the other had rejected them , realising what had happened . It turns out Jennifer had created a fraudulent email in the name of Yehuda and had written the rejection letter . After the revelation it was a fake , Eric used an old password of Jennifer s to hack in to the email account . In sworn affidavit , Yehuda said the actions were unthinkable and immoral .

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK It was n t easy , but Florida made sure New York City would become the unofficial tournament home of the Southeastern Conference , beating Wisconsin 84-83 in overtime on the buzzer-beating shot of the tourney to advance to the Elite Eight . After blowing a double-digit lead in regulation , Florida stunned the Badgers thanks to a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer from Chris Chiozza . It was Chiozza s only made shot from beyond the arc on the night and came after Nigel Hayes made a pair of free throws to put Wisconsin ahead 83-81 with just four seconds remaining . Florida s hard-fought win sets up an all-SEC East Regional Final on Sunday with South Carolina , which advanced earlier in the night with an equally as impressive victory over Baylor . For the Gators , it is the fifth time they have advanced to the Elite Eight since 2011 , and the first time under second-year head coach Mike White . The last time Florida advanced this far in the NCAA tournament was 2014 , when it made the Final Four before losing to eventual national champion UConn . Florida struggled early in the game , trailing by as many as 11 in the first half before outscoring Wisconsin 21-8 to close the half . The Gators were able to capitalize on uncharacteristic errors from the Badgers , forcing seven turnovers in the final 8:09 of the half . Despite the Gators building a double-digit lead to start the second half , Wisconsin stormed back to take the lead after Nigel Hayes converted a three-point play with 10:21 to play in the game . Florida would respond with a 16-3 run over the next 4:48 , but Wisconsin still would n t surrender . The Badgers again tied the game thanks to a 10-2 run in the final 2:10 , capped off by a Zak Showalter 3-pointer with 2.5 seconds remaining , sending the game into overtime . It was the first OT game in this year s tournament . The Gators were led by sophomore guard KeVaughn Allen , who led all scorers with a career-high 35 points in the win . Allen was the only Gator to score in double figures . All five starters for Wisconsin Showalter , Hayes , Ethan Happ , Vitto Brown and Bronson Koenig scored in double figures .

		"paragraph": "Jerry Dipoto is up to his old tricks again . The Seattle Mariners GM , who made more trades last winter than any MLB team in the last 20 years , has pulled off trades on back-to-back days as we approach baseball s trade deadline . On Thursday , he acquired Miami Marlins reliever David Phelps , who has some solid peripherals , but is n t exactly the key to a long-lost playoff berth in Seattle . The cost ? Four minor leaguers , including Brayan Hernandez , who was Seattle s No. 6 prospect . On Friday , Dipoto dealt Seattle s No. 3 prospect , power-hitting outfielder Tyler O Neill , to the St. Louis Cardinals . A somewhat surprising move , since O Neill has hit 75 minor-league homers since the start of the 2015 season . Their return ? Marco Gonzales , a 25-year-old pitcher , who has played in parts of three MLB seasons , most notably in 2014 . He sports a 5.53 ERA in 10 career appearances and will report to Triple-A , according to Ryan Divish of The Seattle Times . It s not uncommon this time of year to see contending teams trade their prospects for proven big leaguers that can get them over the hump and into the postseason . But Seattle s deals have n t exactly done either of these things . The Mariners are within striking distance of the wide-open AL wild card , but at 48-49 , they re just as likely to flame out as they are to charge into the postseason . And their return in these trades is n t exactly earth-shattering . Which makes us wonder : What the heck are the Mariners doing here ? To that point , a few thoughts : Maybe Dipoto feels the playoff pressure . The Mariners have n t made the postseason since 2001 , the longest such streak in MLB , which puts the pressure on Dipoto to do the best he can when he sees a lane in front of him . The AL West is n t really that , as the Houston Astros have a 16-game lead on the Mariners . The wild card might be . The Mariners are 2.5 games out of the second wild-card spot . Totally possible . But they re also one of six teams within five games of the Yankees , who hold that second spot . So lots of traffic in that lane . Maybe Dipoto sees something we do n t . After the Phelps trade , the Mariners GM talked about how expensive starting pitching is right now . The Jose Quintana trade proved that . The Mariners need arms , but do n t really have the assets to get a Sonny Gray or Justin Verlander or even a lesser-priced starter . In Phelps , Dipoto sees a reliever who can handle multiple innings or even start one day . What if one day is September ? In Gonzalez , the Mariners are getting a pitcher who has been hyped he s a former first-round pick but he s not atop the list of trade-deadline difference-makers . He s been sharp in Triple-A this season , with a 2.90 ERA in 11 starts , but that s a long way from helping the Seattle rotation next week . Unless , of course , Dipoto sees something we do n t . Maybe the Mariners soured on O Neill . It happens , right ? While he ranks well on the team s overall prospect list and fans seemed excited about him , O Neill did n t crack Baseball America s midseason Top 100 list after being No. 38 at season s start . He has 19 homers and 56 RBIs so far this season in Triple-A , but his batting average is down almost 50 points , from .293 to .244 . His on-base percentage took a similar dip . Prospects are always a gamble . So in effect , the Mariners are just gambling on a different one now . Maybe the Mariners are just in this weird spot where they have to hedge their bets . When Dipoto made over the roster last winter , he added 18 players from different organizations to the 40-man roster . It became a running joke on social media that Dipoto just could n t stop making trades . But the Mariners are in a weird place . Their core Robinson Cano , Nelson Cruz and Felix Hernandez is aging . The best year for those guys to make the playoffs is right now . But the Mariners also have Kyle Seager , James Paxton and Jean Segura who are closer to their prime . So Seattle is neither a win-now team or a rebuilding team in the traditional sense of the word . With the Astros having a firm grasp on the division and the Mariners playing for , at best , a one-game playoff , Dipoto ca n t exactly mortgage the future for 2017 . So he s left to make peculiar , smaller moves to get players he believes can help the Mariners in small increments be better than the Royals and Yankees and the rest of the wild-card hopefuls . He wants to help the roster , but he wants players who are n t rentals too , players who can help for the long-term . That s a tough trade-deadline balancing act . It was said before the season that the Mariners were trying to build a team in the mold of the Kansas City Royals from a couple years ago . A team that , you ll remember , was kind of funky and constructed in a way that pundits had a hard time figuring out . But a team that won it all . Guess we ll see if Jerry Dipoto s old tricks look genius come September and October . More MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports : Mike Oz is the editor of Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "Brooke Choi is by all accounts a proud 12-year-old offensive lineman . She grew up in a football-loving family , so much so that her mother calls herself a football widow during the fall while her husband coaches and her son and daughter take the field . Brooke has three years of football experience and beat out 22 boys for a roster spot on teams that won two championships in the league in which she used to play . Yet Brooke is different from her teammates . Brooke is at the age where being a girl on the gridiron starts to become a thing . In this instance , it s an issue for the Catholic Youth Organization ( CYO ) and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia , which reversed a short-lived policy in 2014 that allowed for co-ed CYO football teams . In doing so , the archdiocese is back in the spotlight for again denying a talented , passionate player a chance to play in its organization as profiled Monday by Brian Hickey of PhillyVoice . Suzanne Choi attempted to sign her daughter up for the four-parish-wide Chester County Crusaders team the first week of August , but was cut short at the gender portion . In a statement by Crusaders board president Edward Caporellie to the PhillyVoice , the Chois were told girls ca n t register for tackle football by archdiocesan rule and that neither the team nor the district could overturn that decision . Guy Fardone is the Crusaders coach and said he wants to see girls play football , specifically Brooke because of her talent and passion . He said he supports the family , adding they still do n t know why she ca n t play , and made her an honorary captain for the season opener . When I was first helping Brooke try to play , they said she could n t because she could get hurt . I d be more concerned about a 65-pound-boy getting hurt . Brooke was one of the more aggressive players on the team , he told Philly Voice . Then , they came back with the â€˜ inappropriate touching statement . As Suzanne continued to ask questions up the ladder , the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said girls could not play because they feared inappropriate touching could take place . That s what has received the most frustration with Suzanne , who noted her daughter has never had that happen and there are n t locker rooms at that level , and seemingly the most anger from others watching . Mickey Grace was the first girl to carry the ball in a Philadelphia Public League football game in the late 2000s and interned with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this past preseason . Her comments to the Philly Voice put the issue into context with current events . Brooke has the support of the Crusaders coach as well as former coach Tom Kucera , who gave full confidence she could defend herself in a league that he said was a few notches below the one she played in formerly . Grace , of course , supports her as does Caroline Pla , the only girl to play in the CYO . She played in sixth , seventh and eighth grade before the Archdiocese reversed its co-ed ruling . Title IX states that no person shall be excluded on the basis of sex and applies to institutions that receive federal funding . In terms of athletics , it outlines a three-part test that requires schools to follow any of the three options : Suzanne was told the law would be on their side because the archdiocese accepts federal money for its lunch programs . Plus there is precedent in the Mercer vs. Duke University case , which barred places from making an exemption if it had n t before . In this case , Pla was allowed to play . So the argument is why is Choi ( and Pla as an eighth-grader ) is suddenly not allowed ? People love to comment on the decline of football participation . Kids leave the sport for varied reasons , from concussion concerns to sport specialization to increased offerings during the autumn season . While Brooke s issue is at the youth level , the statistics at the high school level are telling . While less boys are playing 11-player football year-after-year , the number of girls has nearly doubled . And while that number does n t come close to making up for the number of boys who have left , it helps keep the decrease percentage lower . Most importantly it shows girls want to play this sport and are increasingly receiving the support and opportunities they deserve to have .

		"paragraph": "The last thing you expect to happen when you go to a nail salon especially one you 've been going to for years is to get injured . Sure , mistakes can happen , especially with the sharp tools used for manicures , but a tiny little cut once in a blue moon is n't a big deal , right ? Eh ... not exactly . As one Arizona woman says , a seemingly innocuous wound can land you in the hospital with an infection . Maria Luisa Gerardo has been going to Phoenix 's TJ Nails for more than a decade , so she figured her most recent visit for a manicure would go as it normally does : without any problems . However , the nail tech , a man reportedly named Bill , accidentally left her with \" a little open wound , here on the side of my finger , \" she told local news station KGUN . When that finger started swelling the next day , according to KGUN , Gerardo went to an urgent-care facility , where she was prescribed antibiotics . She also went back to TJ Nails to tell the technicians about the infection , but the salon more or less brushed off her concerns , offering her $ 100 , Gerardo says . \" It 's nothing . Just clean your hand and buy your medicine , and it will come off , \" the salon employees told her , Gerardo told KGUN . But the infection worsened , landing the loyal client in the hospital for surgery to prevent amputation of the infected finger , Gerardo says . \" He cleaned as much as he could , to try and salvage the finger , \" Gerardo 's son , Victor , told KGUN about the surgeon 's efforts . \" He told me , he kept cutting and cutting the tissue around her finger until it bled , because that was good skin . \" The result is a wound that \" goes all the way down to the bone , \" according to KGUN . It 's so severe , in fact , that KGUN has chosen to blur it in their video coverage of the story . Although it 's unlikely you 'll find yourself with an infection this bad after a trip to a nail salon , you should always keep an eye out for signs of a bad reaction . \" Infections in and around the nail after a manicure are not uncommon . Most bacterial infections involve the skin around the cuticle and along the sides of the nail , called paronychia , and are easily treated , \" Arielle Kauvar , a board-certified dermatologist and director of New York Laser & Skin Care in New York City , tells Allure . \" The most severe infection is caused by the flesh-eating group , A. streptococcus bacteria , which can result in amputation and even death . \" The doctor 's advice : Make sure the instruments being used for your manicure and pedicure are sterilized , confirm that the foot baths are properly sanitized , and never let the technician use a razor or shaver on your calluses .

		"paragraph": "Blame China and those who are breaking trade rules , not Donald Trump , White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said as China warned that all commitments so far in talks with the U.S. over trade will be withdrawn if the president carries out his threat to impose tariffs . Kudlow said rule-breaking is going on all over the place and Trump is simply responding to decades of trade abuse . Do n t blame Trump , Kudlow said on Fox News Sunday . Blame China , blame Europe , blame NAFTA , blame those who do n t want reciprocal trading , tariff rates and protectionism . While both the U.S. and China reported some progress in discussions this weekend about how to reduce China s $ 375 billion goods-trade surplus with the U.S. , Trump s revival last week of a plan to slap tariffs on $ 50 billion of Chinese imports has cast the talks into turmoil . More from Bloomberg.com : Microsoft Is Said to Have Agreed to Acquire Coding Site GitHub If the U.S. rolls out trade measures including tariffs , all the agreements reached in the negotiations wo n t take effect , state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday , citing a statement from the Chinese team that met with a U.S. delegation led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross . The Xinhua report came after Ross met Sunday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks that Ross called friendly and frank , and covered some useful topics about specific export items . At the same time as negotiators focus on technical steps to reduce the U.S. deficit , Trump s swerve has rattled Beijing as it raises the possibility that any agreement made could be simply torn up by the president . More from Bloomberg.com : Trump s â€˜ America First Disrupts Yet Another European Project China is concerned over the U.S. s unpredictability , especially after Trump turned an about-face on tariffs , said Gai Xinzhe , an analyst at Bank of China s finance institute in Beijing . Trump needs to give out more goodwill in exchange for really productive negotiations . Bluff , threat , and willful moves might work in business bargaining , but they could backfire in talks among nations . A commentary by state-run China Radio International said that the government s stance on canceling any agreements reached in the talks if Trump s tariffs go into effect was a red line . The U.S. delegation , which was in Beijing for two days , included energy and agriculture experts , reflecting the U.S. desire to increase exports of natural gas and food . On the Chinese side , officials including Commerce Minister Zhong Shan , Central Bank Governor Yi Gang , Vice Agricultural Minister Han Jun , and Li Fanrong , vice minister of national energy administration , accompanied Liu in the talks , according to a media pool report . More from Bloomberg.com : Germany s Big Pay-Gap Problem During his visit , Ross has been looking to build on a vague joint statement released May 19 , after negotiations in Washington . China pledged then to take steps to substantially reduce the U.S. trade deficit , including by buying more American farm goods and energy , though it did n t commit to a dollar amount . In addition to tariffs , Ross is under pressure from U.S. lawmakers to stay tough on Chinese telecom-equipment maker ZTE Corp . China pressed the U.S. to give ZTE a break after the Commerce Department cut off the company from U.S. suppliers to punish it for allegedly lying to American officials in a sanctions case . Last month , Trump said he would allow ZTE to stay in business once it pays a $ 1.3 billion fine , shakes up its management , and provides high-level security guarantees . Republican Senator Marco Rubio and other lawmakers from both parties have questioned Trump s leniency toward ZTE , arguing the company represents a security risk . The stakes are high for the global economy , which is cruising at its fastest pace of growth in seven years . But the International Monetary Fund has warned that a trade war could threaten the recovery , and policy makers are contending with a growing list of geopolitical risks , from a political crisis in Italy to the rocky progress of peace talks with North Korea . Against that background , China is expressing increasing frustration with the tactics deployed by the White House . The U.S. ca n t have its cake and eat it too , an editorial published by the state-run Global Times on Sunday said . The U.S. needs to choose between tariffs and exporting more to China .

		"paragraph": "It s iPhone season , and the rumors are n t letting up . Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference is set to kick off on June 4 , and it s been nothing but speculation galore in the weeks leading up to the summer conference . While it s likely we wo n t get much information about upcoming iPhones during WWDC , this has n t stopped blogs and leakers from doing their best to pull the curtain off what Apple has planned for 2018 . From a bigger iPhone X to a modern take on the candy-colored iPhone 5c , there have been a mind-boggling number of predictions of what the next trio of iPhones could look like . Apple has n t given us any hints as to what it s cooking up , many leaks and rumors paint a solid , albeit speculative picture of what Apple smartphones will be in our pockets come September . Render of the iPhone SE 2 Possibly the most anticipated rumored release is the 2018 rebirth of the iPhone SE . The iPhone X s $ 999 price tag raised a lot of eyebrows upon its launch and also sparked rumors of potentially cheaper iPhones to come . All the emerging information about a potential revival of the SE points to the fact that it will be budget option in this year s releases . The internet has dubbed this rumored phone the iPhone SE 2 . But established smartphone leaker Evan Blass tweeted a screenshot of what appeared to be insider documents that state the smartphone will be named the iPhone SE ( 2018 ) . Renders of this phone were published by Chinese smartphone case maker Olixar and online accessories store Mobile Fun . These images depict an iPhone that melds together the compact chassis of the iPhone SE with FaceID capabilities and the notched , edge-to-edge display of the iPhone X only with an LDC screen instead of OLED . Japanese Apple blog Macotakara published a May 13 report claiming there are currently three prototypes of the phone in existence and that Apple has yet to begin producing it , according to sources interviewed at the Japan IT Week Spring 2018 Mobile Expo . The same report stated that it will likely come to market sometime between July 1 and September . So do n t expect to hear about iPhone SE ( 2018 ) at WWDC . Render of the iPhone X Plus Next on the list is the rumored iPhone X Plus , which would essentially be a beefed-up version of the iPhone X . A May 8 Macotakara report claimed that it could come with an edge-to-edge , 6.5-inch OLED display . The same report claimed that it would be around 0.2 mm thicker than the iPhone 8 Plus , which would make it comparable to the iPhone X that comes in at 7.7 mm thick . Samsung the company contracted to make most of Apple s phone displays is expected to begin production of this iPhone X Plus as early as May or June , according to the Economic Daily News . We do n t know much else other than these specs and a tentative production date , but a visual artist designed some of their own renders of the rumored iPhone in a concept video of the iPhone X Plus that you can keep looping until Apple officially announces something . The iPhone X Plus has also been said to be being released alongside a direct successor to the iPhone X . This phone has been predicted to have a 5.8-inch , OLED display . MacRumors also reported that it will likely be the same size as the current iPhone X , aside from a larger rear camera . Although this second generation iPhone X might sound a lot like its predecessor , it will likely be cheaper . The Economic Daily News predicted it could start at $ 100 less than what the iPhone X is currently selling for . In order to pull off this decrease in price , Apple could lower the cost of manufacturing its phone by as much as 10 percent , according to DigiTimes . So your wallet might be spared this iPhone season . Aside from these three rumored heavy-hitters , there has also been chatter around a potential revamp of the colorful iPhone 5c . The last time we ve heard any mentions of rainbow-colored Apple phones was back in 2013 , but now the company might bring back these phones as an adjacent generation to the aforementioned iPhone trio . According to a note written by analyst Jun Zhang that was leaked by AppleInsider , Apple could launch multiple colors for the iPhone 8s ( LCD model ) during the latter half of this year . Zhang s report did not cite any of the firm s usual sources , making this prediction speculative at best . The analyst attempts to back up his claims by stating this could be a move to target a younger consumer market . This would make some sense , seeing at the iPhone 5c was a bit of an unsung success . According to Forbes , the smartphone drove more profits than the iPhone 5 , yet it was often painted as a flop by the media . It could be that Apple is trying to recreate its past successes sort of like how it s reviving the iPhone SE . We probably wo n t get any solid information regarding all four of these phone models until the iPhone Keynote in September . But until then , at least we have something to dream about .

		"paragraph": "Sony Pictures Entertainment gave film fans an unexpected treat Tuesday , seemingly uploading an entire film to YouTube rather than the trailer . The video , which has since been pulled from the video site , was advertised as the red-band trailer for Khali the Killer , but an apparent administrative error resulted in the roughly 90 minute feature being posted . The film stars Richard Cabral ( from TV s Lethal Weapon series ) and focuses on a hitman in East Los Angeles who decides to take one last job to pay for his grandmother s end-of-life care . Things , as you might expect , do n t go as planned . The film is slated for an Aug. 31 theatrical release , according to IMDB . It s available now on streaming services , though , which raises the possibility this is a publicity stunt from someone on the Sony team . If so , it worked . The film received over 11,000 views before it was pulled , according to the Independent . Sony Pictures Entertainment did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the incident . If it was a slip , the timing was n t great . Sony Pictures has been struggling for some time and is still shaking off the ramifications from a late 2014 hack that humiliated the company and captured headlines for weeks .

		"paragraph": "Somehow , the Detroit Lions lost a game after it looked like they clearly won , and they did n t even get to play the final few seconds to save the victory . With the Lions at the 1-yard line , Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for what looked like the go-ahead touchdown with eight seconds left . As we know , however , all scores get reviewed . And , what do you know , this was close . As it turned out , Tate was ruled down just inches before he crossed the goal line . The Lions had no timeouts left , and then came the confusing gut punch : There was a 10-second runoff so the game was over . The Lions Twitter feed summed up the finish pretty well : There was plenty to unpack here . First off , it did not seem conclusive that Tate was down . I m not sure how the officials overturned it . Then came the runoff . It makes sense that the officials could n t just let the Lions have another play with eight seconds left and the clock stopped . Had Tate been ruled down at the 1-yard line initially , the clock would have been running . However , the Lions could have hustled and gotten off a play before time ran out had Tate been ruled down right away . It just seems unfair that the Lions never got another chance to get a snap off . In any sense , it was a brutal , horrible loss for the Lions . They went from euphoria to confusion and anger in the matter of seconds . It seems like another rule the NFL will have to look at in the offseason . Frank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "If someone ever decides to make a movie called A Simple Woman , it probably wo n t star Maggie Gyllenhaal . Purposefully or not , the actress has spent nearly her entire career playing characters that defy convention or easy categorization , from the eager BDSM neophyte in 2002 s surreal black comedy Secretary to her Golden Globe-nominated turn as a self-determined prostitute on the current HBO series The Deuce . On paper , there s nothing especially distinctive about her title role in writer-director Sara Colangelo s prickly , unsettling arthouse drama The Kindergarten Teacher : Lisa Spinelli spends her days doling out juice cups and paintbrushes to her tiny charges , and her evenings at home in Staten Island with her kind , rumpled husband ( Michael Chernus ) and two teenage children . The kids at school look at her benignly , like a sort of human pillow with snacks her own treat her mostly with distracted indifference or outright disdain . It s clear , though that Lisa burns for something more : She s become devoted to the adult-education poetry course she takes after work , led by a dreamy , melodically accented instructor ( Gael Garcia Bernal ) . But even her best efforts fall flat her classmates see her work as common and derivative , lacking voice , and her only other audience is her supportive but hapless husband . In other words , she s just one of a million anonymous dreamers failing to translate their aspirations into art , until the day she hears her 5-year-old student Jimmy ( Parker Sevak ) mumbling words to himself that sound a lot like a poem a really good one . And so she grasps onto it , and to him , with the outsize passion of a true believer . Colangelo ( Little Accidents ) has a gift for conveying a sort of feverish , disquieting intimacy onscreen , and a lot of ideas some more clarifying than others about the ways humans sublimate their desires and seek redemption , often impossibly , in other people . And Gyllenhaal , bright-eyed and brittle , brings her signature intensity to the role , though Lisa s true inner world remains murky it s never quite clear if she s just deeply unhappy or certifiably ill . Instead , the movie remains an intriguing but ambiguous portrait of a flawed , fascinating woman who knows herself either too well or not at all . B",

		"paragraph": "McLaren is a name synonymous with motor racing excellence , with eight Formula 1 Constructors Championships and 12 Drivers championships . But over the past five years McLaren has been finding success off the racetrack and on the street by building street legal high-performance vehicles handmade in the UK . Last year marked a banner year for the relatively young carmaker . Globally , McLaren sold over 3,200 cars , a big jump from the approximately 1,600 that it sold in 2015 . But in North America , the automaker topped 1,000 cars sold for the first time representing growth of over 100 % . North America is indeed a huge market for sports car maker like McLaren . And with marquee brands like Ferrari ( RACE ) and Lamborghini already competing in the space , doubling sales in a fierce market is no small feat . Tony Joseph , president of McLaren North America , attributes the big gains made to McLaren s newest line , the Sports Series , which includes the 570S and 570GT models . We feel we re really redefining the sports car segment , Joseph says of the Sports Series in the above video . [ The 570GT ] really has supercar looks , it s got supercar performance , but it s priced in the sports car price segment . The Sports Series cars start at around $ 190,000 . Despite the success of the Sports Series , McLaren is n t losing sight of what it considers the core of the brand , the Super Series , a step above the Sports Series . Headlined by the 675 LT , or Long Tail , this on-the-edge , high-performance supercar ( which starts at around $ 350,000 ) sold out in two weeks . Later this year at March s Geneva Auto Show , Joseph revealed McLaren will be debuting the second generation model of the Super Series , known as the P14 . Clean power McLaren also has its eye on the future , investing in the development of engines that are not only powerful , but also clean . As part of this Track 22 plan , which earmarks $ 1 billion towards new R&D spending , more than half of the plan will be hybrid-powered sports cars . One possibility is an all-electric hypercar that would be part of the McLaren Ultimate series . Think of it as the spiritual successor for the legendary P1 , McLaren s bonkers 1,000-horsepower hybrid hypercar . What s next for McLaren ? Investing in R&D , especially complex powertrains , requires a lot of capital . An initial public offering ( IPO ) could be a big source of much needed cash . Even an acquisition could be in the cards for the growing automaker . While an IPO or merger might be on the horizon , Joseph adds that staying independent has its advantages . Our independence is what we thrive on , our independence allows us to do some of the things that we ve done , Joseph says . It allows us to be very versatile . If this independence means producing supercar after supercar , many of McLaren s passionate fans and customers hope it will stay that way .",

		"paragraph": "Amazon reported revenue of $ 56.6 billion in the third quarter of 2018 , missing Wall Street targets by 1 % . The miss sent shares ( AMZN ) plummeting by nearly 10 % during Friday early trading . While it does n t sound like a big miss , the results are hardly impressive for the e-commerce behemoth which has been impressing investors in recent years . The company s fourth-quarter revenue guidance also bummed many , while some worry that Amazon s rapid expansion may be pausing . Amazon expects net sales to grow between $ 66.5 billion and $ 72.5 billion , or 10 % and 20 % , compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 . The midpoint of the guidance is about 25 % below analysts expectations . Rising costs is one of the major reasons why Amazon lowered its guidance . Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the wage increase for nearly 400,000 employees in the U.S. and the U.K was factored into its fourth-quarter guidance and will impact guidance in 2019 . Credit Suisse estimates the wage increases will cost Amazon an incremental $ 300 million in the fourth quarter and $ 1.1 billion more in 2019 . Amazon denied any negative effect of rising transportation costs related to the USPS plans to hike rates . We re not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019 , Olsavsky said on Thursday . Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence , and we negotiate hard , and we ll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our shipping method . Amazon has a stunning record of beating its fourth-quarter guidance . It has exceeded the mid-point of guidance by an average of 94 % over the past three years , with the lowest beat at 63 % upside in 2015 , according to Piper Jaffray . Analysts believe Amazon will continue to beat on the bottom line . The sales growth slowdown has raised a red flag for investors . Net sales growth has moderated to 29.3 % the weakest quarterly growth rate in over a year and a material slowdown from the past three quarters . International sales growth of 13.4 % marked a steep deceleration from 30.8 % last quarter . Amazon s business overseas now accounts for more than a quarter of total sales . Amazon attributed the slowdown to the acquisition of the Middle East e-commerce website Souk and the Diwali , India s biggest holiday , which was pushed to the fourth quarter . With 17 websites globally , Amazon has been heavily invested in the overseas market , which is still a money-losing segment for the company . It lost a bidding war for Flipkart in India and committed to spending $ 5 billion in the country , where it sees the fastest Prime membership growth rate . Close to home , the competition in the online space is intensifying as well . Walmart and Target have been facilitating online delivery and leveraging in-store pick-up . Department store chains like Macy s have also doubled down on digital investments . This holiday season , for instance , Target is offering free delivery with no minimum purchase required . The U.S. e-commerce market is also becoming saturated in books , electronics and groceries , fashion , there s greater competition , said Cooper Smith , head of Amazon research at Gartner L2 , in an email .

		"paragraph": "ATLANTA Part of Jeremy Pruitt s first appearance at Southeastern Conference media days Wednesday was spent defending his interpersonal skills , which came under sharp attack the day before from a former SEC star quarterback . Aaron Murray , who played at Georgia from 2009-13 and is now an analyst for CBS Sports Network , told a Nashville radio station that he did n t see Pruitt , Tennessee s new head coach , as head coach material . He said Pruitt was disrespectful to head coach Mark Richt when Pruitt was his defensive coordinator at Georgia in 2014-15 . I do n t know if his personality is fit to be a head coach , Murray said on 102.5 The Game . As a head coach , there s so many things that go into it . It s not just going out there and coaching . You have to deal with front office . You ve got to go talk with the president of the university . You have to deal with boosters . You have to deal with the offense , the defense . It s not just going in there and dealing with the kids and scheming up . There s a lot that goes into it . I do n t think he s the right guy to kind of be the CEO of a corporation . It should be noted that Murray was gone before Pruitt arrived in Athens . Wednesday , Pruitt was asked about Murray s remarks . I look at it like this : Fifteen years ago , I was a kindergarten teacher , and today I m the head coach at Tennessee , Pruitt said , according to the Knoxville News-Sentinel . So you probably do n t make that ascension unless you know how to treat people . But ESPN analyst David Pollack , another former Georgia player who like Murray did not play under Pruitt , doubled down on Murray s criticism of Pruitt on-air Wednesday . To address Aaron s Murray comment , because I think it needs to be addressed a little bit , Pollack said , according to SaturdayDownSouth.com , the stories that I have heard and some of y all have heard that came out of Athens that are true , [ from ] coaches that were on the staff , some of the things Jeremy Pruitt did to Mark Richt , some coaches would tell you are the most disrespectful , most crazy things they heard . So , I ll be curious to watch Jeremy Pruitt as he evolves with this relationship with Phillip Fulmer because Jeremy Pruitt did a good job when he was with Nick Saban because he knew where he stood . He did a good job with Jimbo Fisher they let you know where you stand . The hierarchy was very clear . How does he evolve as a head coach ? He put on a good show [ at the main podium at SEC Media Days ] , he definitely showed you what he has . I want to see if he continues to treat people in the correct manner , if he respects authority , because to be honest , the stories we ve heard we ve all heard the same stories , it was pretty bad . It was disrespectful , so that s what I m interested to see . At the podium Wednesday , Pruitt was asked about his time at Georgia and relationship with Richt . You know , Coach Richt , you know , the things he taught you , one thing , probably the biggest thing to me is there s more to life than football , Pruitt said . I know that sounds but there is . And , you know , one of these days , that you do n t care how many championships you win and all that . So I m thankful for the opportunity . Tennessee plays Georgia in Athens Sept. 29 .

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) President Donald Trump brought the world 's two biggest economies to the brink of a trade war Friday by announcing a 25 percent tariff on up to $ 50 billion in Chinese imports to take effect July 6 . Beijing quickly responded that it would retaliate with penalties of the same scale on American goods and it spelled out details to impose tariffs on 545 U.S. exports , including farm products , autos and seafood , according to the Xinhua state news agency . In announcing the U.S. tariffs , Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign pledge to crack down on what he contends are China 's unfair trade practices and its efforts to undermine U.S. technology and intellectual property . \" We have the great brain power in Silicon Valley , and China and others steal those secrets , \" Trump said on \" Fox & Friends . \" '' We 're going to protect those secrets . Those are crown jewels for this country . \" The prospect of a U.S.-China trade war weighed on financial markets Friday . The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 220 points in mid-afternoon trading before recovering somewhat to finish down 84 points . Other stock averages also declined . The U.S. tariffs will cover 1,102 Chinese product lines worth about $ 50 billion a year . Included are 818 items , worth $ 34 billion a year , from a list of 1,333 the administration had released in April . After receiving public comment , the U.S. removed 515 product lines from the list , including TVs and some pharmaceuticals , according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity . The administration is targeting an additional 284 Chinese products , which it says benefit from Beijing 's strong-armed industrial policies , worth $ 16 billion a year . But it wo n't impose those tariffs until it gathers public comments . U.S. companies that rely on the targeted imports and ca n't find substitutes can apply for exemptions from the tariffs . The Trump administration has sought to protect consumers from a direct impact from the tariffs , which amount to a tax on imports . The tariffs target mainly Chinese industrial machinery , aerospace parts and communications technology , while sparing such consumer goods as smartphones , TVs , toys and clothes that Americans purchase by the truckload from China . These tariffs will impose higher costs on U.S. companies that use the equipment . And over time , those costs could be passed on to consumers . But the impact wo n't be as visible as it would be if consumer products were taxed directly . By contrast , the Trump administration earlier this year imposed steep tariffs on imported washing machines . By May , the cost of laundry equipment had jumped 17 percent from two months earlier , according to government data . The administration characterized the tariffs it announced Friday as entirely proper . \" It 's thorough , it 's moderate , it 's appropriate , \" U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer said on Fox Business Network 's \" Mornings With Maria . \" Lighthizer added , \" Our hope is that it does n't lead to a rash reaction from China . \" But Beijing 's Commerce Ministry retorted : \" The Chinese side does n't want to fight a trade war , but facing the shortsightedness of the U.S. side , China has to fight back strongly . We will immediately introduce the same scale and equal taxation measures , and all economic and trade achievements reached by the two sides will be invalidated . \" A ministry statement gave no details of what U.S. goods would be hit by Beijing 's retaliatory tariffs . But China in April had announced possible targets , including light aircraft , orange juice , whiskey , beef and soybeans an economically and politically important export from America 's heartland . \" The farmer can maybe look to their soybean associations for help to find other markets , but that does n't happen immediately , \" said Dan Basse of AgResource , an agricultural research and advisory firm . \" There 's not much the farmer can do right now . \" The longer-term concern , Basse said , is that China will increasingly look to Argentina and Brazil and that the United States will lose market share . Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada , Mexico and European allies , sparking anger and retaliatory threats from some of America 's closest longtime allies . But his proposed tariffs against China risk igniting a damaging trade war involving the world 's two biggest economies . Trump 's decision follows his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . The president has coordinated closely with China on efforts to pressure Pyongyang to eliminate its nuclear arsenal . But he signaled that whatever the implications for that or other issues , \" I have to do what I have to do \" to address China 's trade policies . By June 30 , the administration is expected to finish writing rules to restrict China 's ability to invest in U.S. technology . Most of all , the U.S. tariffs are a response to China 's attempts to supplant U.S. technological dominance , including outright theft of trade secrets and its requirement that U.S. companies share technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market . The Trump administration has also argued that Beijing subsidies favored industries , encouraging them overinvest and overproduce . The result : China has flooded world markets in steel , aluminum , solar panels and products , thereby undercutting prices and putting foreign rivals out of business . Wall Street has viewed the trade tensions with concern , fearful that they could strangle economic growth and undermine the benefits of the tax cuts Trump signed into law last year . \" Imposing tariffs places the cost of China 's unfair trade practices squarely on the shoulders of American consumers , manufacturers , farmers , and ranchers , \" said Thomas Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Political reactions to Friday 's announced tariffs cut across party lines . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , said Trump was \" right on target . \" \" China is our real trade enemy , and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs , \" Schumer added . But Rep. Dave Reichert , R-Wash. , said he disagreed with the action because \" Americans will bear the brunt instead of China . \" AP Writers Christopher Rugaber , Kevin Freking and Martin Crutsinger in Washington and Alexandra Olson in New York contributed to this report .",

		"paragraph": "When Dave Chappelle makes a comeback , he really comes back : Two hour-plus standup specials premiere on Netflix today , and they re both very good , one better than the other . The first , titled The Age of Spin : Dave Chappelle Live at the Hollywood Palladium , was filmed in Los Angeles in 2016 the second , titled Deep in the Heart of Texas : Live at Austin City Limits , was taped in 2015 . The range of subjects discussed in these two performances is dazzling : from O.J. Simpson to the Care Bears musings on racism , homophobia , rape , and transgender rights two stories about having things thrown at him ( in one , it s a snowball in the other , it s a banana peel the banana peel story wins ) . Chappelle s style remains familiar to us from his Chappelle Show days and previous comedy specials : deceptively loose and languid , he ambles around the stage talking in a relaxed drawl , his tone tightening up primarily when he s imitating white voices . The Age of Spin is a brilliantly organized concert that s structured around O.J. Simpson : Near the top of the show , Chappelle explains that he s met Simpson four times and that over the course of the performance he will tell you about each meeting . ( The final tale serves as his encore . ) On Simpson , Chappelle is amazing , never letting the man accused of murder off the hook , while also placing the Juice in a cultural context . He references FX s American Crime Story : The People v. O.J. Simpson , but it s really the great documentary O.J. : Made in America that contains the complexity of what Chappelle gets at here . He s a rigorous taskmaster to the audience : After a throwaway punchline about Nicole Simpson elicits hurt groans , he admonishes the crowd quickly : Man the f *** up , or you re not gon na make it through the show . The Age of Spin s other remarkable set piece is about Bill Cosby . Again , Chappelle is devastating to the man who has allegedly committed heinous crimes , but Chappelle also insists that we understand just what a force for good Cosby was for so long , to millions of people of Chappelle s generation . It s a very delicate comedic needle to thread , and Chappelle does it without stabbing himself . The Austin special is a little more dated , with material about the Ebola crisis and the infamous Ray Rice tape , and Chappelle seems a little more weighed down by headlines about police shootings : It s a tough time for the blacks , he intones more than once . Nevertheless , the banana peel story Chappelle says he had one thrown at him during a concert in Santa Fe is a solid chunk of material that showcases the comedian s ability to get inside the minds of other people to figure out what motivates them . Even hecklers with banana peels . There are some viewers of these specials who are going to take offense at Chappelle s politically incorrect thoughts about society s current definitions of masculine and feminine , and many probably wo n t agree with me about my admiration for his Cosby analysis . But that s what makes venturesome comedy so exhilarating : You laugh sometimes at things your conscience says you should n t find funny but you also have to think through your positions on uncomfortable issues . Both Dave Chappelle specials are streaming now on Netflix .

		"paragraph": "For those who prefer flesh-and-blood super heroes to the comic-book variety , Battle of the Sexes offers a real-life wonder woman saga with the power to educate and inspire , focusing on the drama that went down both on-court and off when Wimbledon triple-winner Bobby Riggs challenged ladies tennis world champion Billie Jean King to a boys-against-girls exhibition match . The outcome is widely known , but the backstory proves boisterously entertaining and incredibly well-suited to the current climate , as King was both fighting for her gender and exploring her sexuality in 1973 , when the widely publicized face-off happened . Stepping up their game considerably , Little Miss Sunshine duo Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this perfectly cast crowd-pleaser , which reteams them with Steve Carell , who dons sideburns and a bad wig to play the 55-year-old Riggs but is otherwise nicely matched to the extravagant gambling man s larger-than-life persona . Still , it s King whom nearly everyone will be rooting for here , especially since the 29-year-old was facing off against a kind of chauvinism that has n t necessarily gone away , and thoroughly modern La La Land star Emma Stone seems uncannily well-suited to the part . She s an actress who generally seems out of place in period movies but is just right to play a woman so far ahead of her time . She fires the first salvo in the eponymous battle of the sexes after reading that the male players will be competing for a cash prize eight times that of the women s a discovery that inspires her and business partner Gladys Heldman ( Sarah Silverman ) to burst into an exclusive all-male club and confront the man they deem responsible : retired tennis champ turned USLTA honcho Jack Kramer ( Bill Pullman , who sounds eerily convinced of the character s Stone Age convictions ) . When Kramer refuses to make things equal , King announces her plans to form a rival league what would become the Women s Tennis Assn. wooing the sport s best lady athletes to her cause , even if it means taking a major pay cut up front . Eventually , Heldman manages to book Virginia Slims as a sponsor for the WTA circuit , and while the cigarette brand s You ve come a long way , baby tagline suits the new league s women s - lib attitude , it does n t necessarily apply to the nearly half-century since . What makes Battle of the Sexes so compelling today is n t how obsolete the era s chauvinist attitudes were , but rather how little things have changed , both in sports and the world at large . King s coming out if only to herself and her dreamboat husband ( Austin Stockwell , looking like Scooby-Doo s hunky blond friend Fred ) occupies a significant portion of the film , shining a light on more than just the conservativeness of the era , but the near-impossibility gay athletes faced ( and still face ) in being true to their identities , lest they lose sponsorships and perhaps even their place on the team . Meanwhile , Carell s character serves as an almost clownish mouthpiece for old-school chauvinist views , as Riggs goes on television to promote the match by spouting that women belong in the kitchen or the bedroom , and insisting that he can beat any female player on the court . He s naturally competitive , to the extent that he s attending therapy and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to calm the habit . But mostly , he wants to get out of the emasculation of his own marriage : Ever since tying the knot with the wealthy Priscilla ( Elisabeth Shue ) , Bobby has been stuck working a boring office job and he sees this match as a way to resurrect his celebrity . And he s not wrong , adopting the men-on-top routine as a kind of shtick for those pre-politically correct times . As recent events in Charlottesville , Va. , have demonstrated , when a public figure starts to joke about such things , it allows those with far scarier convictions to relax their own filters , and suddenly , the national discourse has swung into ugly and entirely inappropriate territory which Dayton and Faris do n t shy away from depicting , and which should give the film added resonance this fall ( though it almost certainly would ve been a full-on zeitgeist phenomenon had the country elected its first woman president ) . Though depicted as faithful , Riggs is actively deceptive about his extracurricular betting , creating intriguing but only half-explored tensions at home ( at one point , Priscilla kicks him out , and Bobby finds himself sleeping on his older son s couch , played by Bill Pullman s son , Lewis ) . In her own corner , King is facing marital problems as well , the unforeseen consequence of the entire Women s Tennis Assn. crew getting makeovers at a Los Angeles salon , where King meets hairdresser Marilyn Barnett ( Andrea Riseborough ) . The romantic spark between the two characters feels real , as Stone shines with the glow of someone who s just been recognized for the first time as her true self . It s a charged encounter that pays off a few scenes later , when Marilyn shows up at one of King s matches . The two go out dancing and awkwardly find their way back to her room , where they share a bed . The love scene that follows is awkwardly intercut with domestic trouble on Riggs end not for the first time , either . It s a shame that , however much better conceived Battle of the Sexes feels than Dayton and Faris two earlier features ( credit for which must go in part to Slumdog Millionaire screenwriter Simon Beaufoy ) , the transitions between the two rivals storylines are never elegant ( blame for which must also go partly to Beaufoy ) . Still , a smooth back-and-forth volley is the least you d expect from a movie about tennis . There s not much actual gameplay in the movie , which is probably for the best . The film runs more than two hours as it is , and it s more about the long game King s determination to get equal rights for women players than the fate of any one match . Even so , there is a same-sex rivalry with Margaret Court ( Jessica McNamee ) within the Virginia Slims Circuit that provides yet another intriguing subplot . And Alan Cumming also pops up as the league s fashion designer , Ted , who vocalizes some of the challenges facing closet gays at the time . Frankly , it s surprising just how many facets of this story there are to explore , and Battle of the Sexes does so in such a way that should appeal to both audiences old enough to remember and those curious to know more . Dayton and Faris honor the feel of 1973 by shooting on anamorphic 35 mm film , even if handheld lensing during emotional scenes gives things a more contemporary edge . Likewise , they have fun outfitting their characters in period costumes and tennis uniforms , but resist going overboard on production design ( which is more than could be said for Little Miss Sunshine ) . Much of the retro energy derives from the soundtrack , which includes cues such as Crimson and Clover and Rocket Man but not Elton John s 1977 song Philadelphia Freedom , which he dedicated to King . Only in tennis do all the greatest battles start with the words love all . Get more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

		"paragraph": " Iowa Rep. Steve King urged President Trump on Thursday to follow through on his promise to shut down the southwest border if Mexico does not block a caravan of Central American migrants from making their way toward the United States . During an appearance on a talk show of conservative Des Moines radio personality Simon Conway on Thursday evening , King described the caravan , which had reportedly grown to include more than 3,000 migrants since its departure from Honduras , as an invasion . He also endorsed Trump s threats to cut off U.S. aid to Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador the so-called Northern Triangle countries from which a vast majority of children and families who ve sought asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico in recent years have come , many of them fleeing rampant gang violence in their homelands . That adds up to quite a bit of money , King said , encouraging the president to say further that we ll redirect those funds into building a wall . Such views are to be expected from King , an eight-term Republican congressman who has built a reputation on his incendiary verbal attacks against immigrants . But while King often finds himself on the furthest fringes of the immigration debate as illustrated by his recent endorsement of Toronto s white nationalist mayoral candidate , which he also defended during his appearance on Conway s show his comments on the caravan simply echoed the message put forth by the president and fueled by other Republicans this week . During the segment , both King and Conway separately referenced a video first posted on Twitter Wednesday by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida that supposedly showed women and children in Honduras receiving cash to join the caravan . Time to investigate the source ! Gaetz tweeted , suggesting that U.S.-backed nongovernmental organizations or George Soros , the wealthy investor and progressive bogeyman of the right wing , were paying migrants to storm the U.S. border ahead of the midterm elections . Guatemala-based journalist Luis Assardo took it upon himself to heed Gaetz s call for an investigation and discovered , first , that the video had not been taken in Honduras , as the Congressman had stated , but rather in Guatemala . In a thread posted to Twitter Thursday , Assardo wrote that he spoke to people in the town where the video was shot and was told that local merchants had collected money among themselves to give to the migrants as their caravan passed through the area . Without acknowledging Assardo s reporting , Gaetz amended his original theory in a Thursday tweet . UPDATE : Because a Honduran government official sent me this video , I believed it came from Honduras , the Congressman wrote . By then , Trump had already seized on the original video , reposting it from his own account with the message , Can you believe this , and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country ? At a rally in Montana that evening , Trump continued to pull the conspiracy thread , suggesting that Democrats were encouraging an illegal immigration onslaught because they figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat . Of course , none of the non-U.S. citizens currently attempting to seek asylum or sneak across the border illegally would be eligible to vote in the upcoming congressional elections , a fact Trump failed to mention . Ahead of King s appearance on the show , which is broadcast on Iowa s largest talk radio station , Conway , a British immigrant who describes himself as one of the proudest citizens of the United States , perpetuated the theory that migrants who d joined the caravan were not actually leaving home of their own volition but were in fact being used as pawns in a deliberate attack designed to make Trump and Republicans look bad ahead of the midterms . He quipped that the caravan should be considered foreign interference in the upcoming election . Later on , Conway assured King that he d already addressed the video when the Congressman asked if he d seen the footage of people being paid in cash . In a tweet Friday morning , former House speaker and Trump ally Newt Gingrich described the caravan as an effort to attack American sovereignty . Adam Isacson , director for Defense Oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America , a nongovernmental research and human rights organization , quickly dismissed the notion that the caravan was part of a political conspiracy . It makes me laugh that Democrats would want the visuals of migrants coming in a big horde two and a half weeks before the midterms , he said . Isacson explained that the driving force behind the relatively new caravan phenomenon has been the fact that the journey to U.S. through Mexico has become extremely dangerous for migrants , noting that women and girls who make the journey often preemptively take birth control because they re sure they ll be raped . One way to avoid violence in Mexico is to hire a smuggler , which can cost thousands of dollars . The other way is to embark on the journey in large groups . There s safety in numbers , he said . The timing of this particular caravan , which was reportedly led by former Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes and three others before Fuentes was detained upon entering Guatemala , is notably different from the annual pre-Easter pilgrimage of mostly Central American migrants that has been organized by the Mexico-based group Pueblo Sin Fronteras for the past eight years . ( Irineo Mujica , an activist with Pueblo Sin Fronteras who helped lead a caravan with the organization through Mexico last spring , was reportedly arrested on the Mexican border with Guatemala while marching with migrants on Thursday . ) However , Isacson said , the fact that the current caravan quickly accumulated thousands of participants following its departure from Honduras shows how willing people are to flee . Jess Morales Rocketto , political director of National Domestic Workers Alliance and chair of Families Belong Together , an activist movement that sprang up in opposition to the Trump administration s family separation policy , agreed . She noted that her organization provided assistance to Pueblo Sin Fronteras during last spring s caravan , recalling the incredibly harrowing stories of gang violence she heard from migrants who participated in that journey . The idea that any of those people would be coming here out of anything other than desperation and doing anything other than an incredibly courageous act to save their lives is completely false , she said , suggesting that Trump and Republicans are seizing on this caravan in an effort to rouse concerns about illegal immigration ahead of the midterm elections . In fact , Trump made clear Thursday night that the caravan is now firmly part of his midterm strategy , telling voters in Montana , This will be an election of Kavanaugh , the caravan , law and order and common sense .

Turner s ink reads , the pack survives , alongside the House Stark direwolf sigil . When the image of her tattoo was posted to Instagram by the artist last week , fans began to theorize that Jon ( well , kinda a Stark ) , Sansa , Arya , and Bran might come out the victors when the HBO fantasy series airs its eighth and final season next year . It s just a quote from last season , Turner told host James Corden on The Late Show Thursday night . Everyone figures that the pack really does survive , but it s just a moral that I like to live by .

Turner admitted she received warnings from those close to her who thought fans would read too much into the tattoo which , of course , they did .

The 47-year-old actor and Boston native posted a shirtless photo to Instagram on Monday , in praise of James move from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Lakers .

		"paragraph": "By David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. spy satellites have detected renewed activity at the North Korean factory that produced the country s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States , a senior U.S. official said on Monday , in the midst of talks to compel Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arms . Photos and infrared imaging indicate vehicles moving in and out of the facility at Sanumdong , but do not show how advanced any missile construction might be , the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the intelligence is classified . The Washington Post reported on Monday that North Korea appeared to be building one or two new liquid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles at the large research facility on the outskirts of Pyongyang , citing unidentified officials familiar with intelligence reporting . According to the U.S. official who spoke to Reuters , one photo showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the North has used to move its ICBMs . Since the trailer was covered , it was not possible to know what , if anything , it was carrying . The White House said it did not comment on intelligence . A senior official at South Korea 's presidential office said U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies are closely looking into various North Korean movements , declining specific comment . The evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity in North Korea 's nuclear and missile facilities despite talks with the United States and a June summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump . Trump declared soon afterward that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat . Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work toward denuclearization , but Pyongyang has offered no details as to how it might go about that and subsequent talks have not gone smoothly . It was not the first time U.S. intelligence clashed with the president 's optimism . In late June , U.S. officials told U.S. media outlets that intelligence agencies believed North Korea had increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons and that it did not intend to fully give up its nuclear arsenal . U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs despite its pledge to denuclearize . But he insisted the Trump administration was still making progress in its talks with Pyongyang . Joel Wit , a former State Department negotiator and founder of 38 North , a North Korea monitoring project , said it was unrealistic to expect North Korea to stop its programs \" until the ink is dry on an agreement . \" That was the case with U.S. negotiations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War , and more recently with Iran , \" which continued to build more centrifuges capable of producing nuclear material even as it negotiated with the United States to limit those capabilities , \" Wit said . The Sanumdong factory produced two Hwasong-15 ICBMs , North Korea s longest-range missiles , but the U.S. official noted that Pyongyang still had not tested a reliable re-entry vehicle capable of surviving a high-velocity trip through the Earth s atmosphere and delivering a nuclear warhead . It is possible , the official said , that any new missiles the North is building may be for further testing of such vehicles and of more accurate guidance systems . They seem to have figured out the engines , but not all the higher-tech stuff , and that might be what this is about , the official said . What s more , a liquid-fueled ICBM does n t pose nearly the threat that a solid-fueled one would because they take so long to fuel , and that s something we almost certainly could see in time to abort a launch , given our assets in the vicinity .

		"paragraph": "Peggy Olson and Don Draper slow-danced to Frank Sinatra 's \" My Way \" on Sunday 's episode of Mad Men , titled \" The Strategy , \" and wow â€¦ it was a pretty perfect moment . But beyond it being a very tender father-daughter scene for Don and Peggy , in their ever-intertwined rollercoaster careers and lives , it also a marked change in the life and style of one of the strongest female characters on TV . In that moment , with that dance , we got to see the full evolution of Peggy Olson : From optimist , to pessimist , to successful and well-adjusted realist . Here we break down that progression , marked by the times we 've seen Peggy cut a rug on the show.Peggy the Optimist : Season 1 , Episode 8 , \" The Hobo Code \" The year was 1960 and Peggy Olson , still fairly new on Don Draper 's desk , had already shown promise in the agency 's focus group for Belle Jolie lipstick and had been asked to write some copy for the ads . She 'd also already slept with Pete Campbell ( Vincent Kartheiser ) in the show 's pilot , \" Smoke Gets In Your Eyes , \" just days before he married Trudy ( Alison Brie ) . Pete showed up at Peggy 's apartment , drunk from his bachelor party ( \" You must think I 'm a creep ... I had to see you . \" ) , and she let him in . Ironically , it was just hours after her new boss Joan Holloway ( Christina Hendricks ) welcomed her to the agency and then promptly suggested she see her gynecologist for birth control . Too little , too late â€¦ By the second time Pete and Peggy had sex in Pete 's office , after he returned from his honeymoon , in \" The Hobo Code \" Peggy was already gaining a bit of weight from what we 'd eventually discover was a pregnancy . Pete even remarked that her skirt was tight , somewhere around the time he threw her on the couch , ripped her blouse , and had sex with her again ( \" Peggy , do you know how hard it is to see you walking around here everyday ? \" ) . Later that day , Don Draper and Co. toasted to their Belle Jolie win , with Peggy 's \" Mark Your Man \" copy , inviting her into the office for a celebratory drink , then the rest of \" the girls \" in the office insisted they all go to P.J. Clarke 's after work to continue the party . [ Photos : Do You Recognize These ' Mad Men ' Guest Stars ? ] After dancing to \" Choo Choo Cha Cha \" with Freddy Rumsen ( Joel Murray ) , a giddy Peggy and everyone else at the bar screamed with excitement when someone put Chubby Checker 's \" The Twist \" on the jukebox . The only person not excited ? A sulking Pete Campbell , sitting in the corner booth , drinking and watching all the fun â€¦ so Peggy twisted on over to him , quite seductively , and said , \" Dance with me . \" His response a very cold \" I do n't like you like this \" left Peggy in tears . And that was the end of that little romance . Peggy had been feeling on top of the world , optimistic about her future at work and with Pete ( no matter how misguided that was ) , and her confidence was just beaming in one comment , one look , Pete was able to take the glow of that little victory away from her and she started to realize this balance of life and men and success was n't going to be easy.Peggy the Pessimist : Season 5 , Episode 1 , \" A Little Kiss \" It was Memorial Day 1966 , and Don Draper 's 40th birthday celebration . While Don 's new wife Megan ( Jessica Pare ) was playing hostess and mentally preparing for her big surprise rendition of \" Zou Bisou Bisou , \" copy editor Peggy was getting a nice little buzz on and doing a new kind of twist with her boyfriend , Abe . Yes , six years later , no one else was twisting to the loungey live music , but Peggy does n't have time to go out and learn new moves , people ! Abe had some pretty awkward party conversations from talking about bombs and war and communism with Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) and Stan ( Jay R. Ferguson ) to preaching about the riots to Pete and Trudy but nothing could top Peggy , now at her most confused and beat-down and pessimistic , professionally . ( Remember , this was Peggy , post - \" The Suitcase , \" still struggling with the idea that no one needed to thank her for her hard work because ( all together now ) \" That 's what the money is for ! \" ) [ Video : ' Mad Men ' Mash-Up : The AMC Drama 's Most Hilarious and Bizarre Moments ] After Peggy and Abe finally made their way over to say hello to the birthday boy , Peggy filled an awkward silence with something much worse directed at Don : \" I just wanted to make sure we said hi . I ca n't stay that long I have to go back and re-do the Heinz pitch . But I guess you know that . \" She immediately kicked herself for bringing up work in such a bitter , accusatory tone when Megan swooped Don away , but her job insecurities , increased cockiness with her work ( she loved that bean ballet ! ) , and jealousy about Don 's ability to have a successful work life and an amazing ( in her eyes ) home life were obvious . Celebration over . No more dancing for the evening . Peggy the Realist : Season 7 , Episode 6 , \" The Strategy \" Now it 's 1969 . Peggy is the copy chief of the agency , single but successful , and being told by everyone including Don 's wife Megan that she 's basically the new Don Draper . And , essentially , she is . She 's Don 's boss now , so she took that little bit of power to put him on the spot when he suggested an alternate idea for the Burger Chef pitch she 'd already worked so hard to nail down . Calling Don at home , knowing Megan was in town , was a very familiar scene Peggy was using some of Don 's best inconsiderate boss tricks back on him , but she was also trying to make him choose between work and home life , like she felt she 'd been forced to do . She called to push his buttons , hoping he 'd admit that he made a mistake by questioning her . Does n't she know better by now?Don hung up on her to let her stew at the office alone , but their relationship has been through enough that we knew he 'd show up to save the day . The surprise came when his advice was more about helping her finally have that confidence at the office to stand by her work , to fight for her copy , to insist on pitching it to the client ( instead of Pete 's suggestion that Don take the lead , once again ) , and to save the day herself . [ Related : 5 More ' Mad Men ' Theories : Is Don a Hijacker ? Is Sally Headed to Woodstock ? ] While Peggy sulked about turning 30 and plead with Don to teach her his process , he taught her much more about her approach to life by revealing his own insecurities , about his work and his legacy . \" I worry about a lot of things , but I do n't worry about you , \" Don said , adding : \" You 're doing great . \" Those three little words did the trick Peggy nailed the new ad concept almost immediately after . So when Frank Sinatra 's \" My Way \" ( lyrics below ) swelled on the radio , and Don stood up and asked Peggy to dance , the reality of the situation set in : Peggy needs to start living a full life , taking the blows , and doing things her way if she ever wants to be truly happy . The Mad Men midseason finale airs Sunday at 10 p.m. on AMC . If the emotion of the scene from \" The Strategy \" did n't grab you , here are the lyrics to Frank Sinatra 's \" My Way , \" just to see how fitting it truly is : And now , the end is here And so I face the final curtain My friend , I 'll say it clear I 'll state my case , of which I 'm certain I 've lived a life that 's full I traveled each and ev'ry highway And more , much more than this , I did it my way Regrets , I 've had a few But then again , too few to mention I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption I planned each charted course , each careful step along the byway And more , much more than this , I did it my way Yes , there were times , I 'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew But through it all , when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way I 've loved , I 've laughed and cried I 've had my fill , my share of losing And now , as tears subside , I find it all so amusing To think I did all that And may I say , not in a shy way , \" Oh , no , oh , no , not me , I did it my way \" For what is a man , what has he got ? If not himself , then he has naught To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows and did it my way !",

		"paragraph": "The Trump administration is finalizing a proposal that would make it more difficult for legal immigrants to get citizenship or green cards if they have ever used public assistance programs including Obamacare , food stamps and children s health insurance , NBC News Julia Ainsley reports . The plan would reportedly also limit citizenship for immigrants who received public assistance for their children , even if those children are already citizens . The rationale : \" The administration is committed to enforcing existing immigration law , which is clearly intended to protect the American taxpayer by ensuring that foreign nationals seeking to enter or remain in the U.S are self-sufficient , a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security told NBC . Any proposed changes would ensure that the government takes the responsibility of being good stewards of taxpayer funds seriously and adjudicates immigration benefit requests in accordance with the law . \" The proposal , which Ainsley calls part of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller s plan to limit the number of migrants who get legal status , likely would not have to be approved by Congress . The background : Immigration law has long held that an immigrant is to be denied permanent residence if he or she is likely to become a public charge . Guidelines in place since 1999 have defined the term narrowly as someone who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence , either through cash assistance programs or by receiving long-term care at government expense . The existing guidelines specify that non-cash benefits such as Medicaid , the Children s Health Insurance Program and food programs are not part of the public charge determination . The Trump plan would change that , defining the term more stringently . What it means : Using some public benefits like Social Security Insurance has already hindered immigrants from obtaining legal status in the past , NBC s Ainsley writes , but the programs included in the recent draft plan could mean that immigrant households earning as much as 250 percent of the poverty level could be rejected . Experts tell Ainsley that as many as 20 million immigrants could be affected by the Trump plan . The research : Overall , immigrants are less likely to consume welfare benefits and , when they do , they generally consume a lower dollar value of benefits than native-born Americans , a CATO Institute study this year said . The criticism : The reported Trump administration proposal drew sharp reproach from immigration advocates and others . \" Any policy forcing millions of families to choose between the denial of status and food or health care would exacerbate serious problems such as hunger , unmet health needs , child poverty and homelessness , with lasting consequences for families ' wellbeing and long-term success and community prosperity , \" the National Immigration Law Center said in a statement to NBC . New York magazine s Jonathan Chait argued that members of the middle class who get health insurance through their employer or Medicare are getting similar taxpayer-financed benefits demonstrating that the Trump proposal is just an empty pretense : Programs like Obamacare and CHIP simply extend the same regimen of subsidies and risk pooling to the low-income population that have already been granted to the middle class . To define people getting insurance this way as â€˜ public charges does violence to the concept . The Washington Post s Paul Waldman and Greg Sargent write that the proposal is a clear sign of the administration s white nationalist agenda and one that can work by playing into prejudices Americans have about welfare : There s little doubt that these initiatives are born of the sincere contempt that President Trump , Stephen Miller , and others in the administration have for immigrants , particularly non-white ones , they write . The strategy is clear : portray legal immigrants as a drain on the system , taking advantage of hard-working people like you . Like what you 're reading ? Sign up for our free newsletter .",

		"paragraph": "LAS VEGAS ( AP ) The Latest on the release by Las Vegas police of witness statements and officer reports in the investigation of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history ( all times local ) : 7:20 p.m. A person staying in a room two floors below and six rooms away from the gunman on the Mandalay Bay 's 30th floor during the Las Vegas mass shooting tried to call 911 and the hotel 's front desk to report that the shooter sounded like he was on that floor or above it . The person , whose name and gender were redacted in records released Wednesday by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police , was unable to get through to 911 or the Mandalay Bay and instead called the nearby Luxor hotel to report the shooting . The call was transferred to Mandalay Bay security and the person reported the shooter appeared to be on the 30th floor . The person waited by the hotel room peephole and saw about four police officers pass by 20 minutes later . The person stayed put for 40 to 50 more minutes before police called to say they had found the shooter on the 32nd floor . \" I tried to tell somebody as fast as possible that he was in our area but I could n't get through , \" the person said . The person later reported hearing a single pop , which he believed was the gunman killing himself . 5:30 p.m. A man who says he met Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock less than a month before the Oct. 1 attack told authorities that Paddock had ranted against the government and warned that law enforcement and the military would start confiscating guns . In a jailhouse interview with police and the FBI , the man said Paddock called Federal Emergency Management Agency \" camps \" set up after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \" a dry run for law enforcement and military to start kickin ' down doors and ... confiscating guns . \" The man , whose name was redacted in reports released Wednesday , quoted Paddock saying somebody has to wake up the American public and get them to arm themselves . The man said he met with Paddock outside a Las Vegas sporting goods store after posting an online ad to sell schematics to convert semi-automatic guns to fire automatically . Police and the FBI refused to answer questions from The Associated Press about the account . Authorities have not provided a motive in what was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history . Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak told AP that police and the FBI told him no motive has been identified . Sisolak said he had n't heard of the man 's account and he could not say whether it was credible . 5:10 p.m. A Mandalay Bay housekeeper who cleaned the Las Vegas gunman 's hotel room four days before the Oct. 1 shooting told police that he made her uncomfortable . The housekeeper 's statement to police was released Wednesday by police after a court battle by The Associated Press and other media organizations to obtain public records about the Oct. 1 shooting . The woman told police that Stephen Paddock answered the door then returned to his computer and ordered room service . She emptied the refrigerator and changed the bed sheets at his request . She said he sat at a table eating soup but kept staring at her , at one point asking \" Are you okay ? \" She responded that she was but needed to get items from her cart . The woman said Paddock kept staring at her while he ate and it was \" embarrassing . \" 4:55 p.m. Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos told police he was afraid he was going to be killed when he was shot by gunman Stephen Paddock while investigating a stairwell door that was being kept shut by a metal bracket . Records released by Las Vegas police Wednesday show Campos was interviewed Oct. 4 on the 32nd floor of the casino-resort . That 's the same floor from which the gunman carried out the attack . Campos says he initially received a call from dispatch around 10 p.m. and was told to check \" doors \" as the property has a system that signals when a door has been opened for long periods . He says he reached the 32nd floor through an elevator after noticing the stairwell door that leads to the hallway was locked or secured . He says he then walked down the hall and discovered a metal bracket keeping the door shut . He contacted security and maintenance . Campos says he then heard what sounded like a \" very loud drill , \" was shot in the left calf while walking away , heard what he described as automatic fire and contacted security dispatch . 3:35 p.m. A Las Vegas Strip casino host who told police that he met Stephen Paddock several times when he gambled over the years says he had a bit of a temper . The man told police and the FBI on Oct. 7 that he would provide Paddock with hotel rooms and show tickets . He says he chatted with him from time to time while Paddock gambled . The host 's name was redacted from police reports made public Wednesday . He described the man who authorities say killed 58 people and injured hundreds as an \" odd guy \" who liked to talk about gambling and traveling , and who once called screaming to complain that it took 20 minutes for his luggage to be brought to his room . The host says Paddock once was given a penthouse presidential suite on the 51st floor of the Rio hotel , and that he later requested the room again several times . 1:45 p.m. A Las Vegas woman who witnessed the chaos of the mass shooting in Las Vegas says she knew the sounds of gunfire were not firecrackers when she saw a man nearby drop to the ground , his \" eyes wide open lifeless . \" As she crouched down , a massive spraying of bullets rained down and the unidentified woman thought the gunfire was coming from helicopters above . Her account was among those provided by Las Vegas police in a DVD with witness statements and officer reports about last year 's mass shooting that killed 58 people and injured hundreds on the Las Vegas Strip . It was made public after a court battle by The Associated Press and other media organizations to obtain public records about the Oct. 1 shooting The woman says she climbed a fence and sprinted toward a stage where she saw people taking cover . She had to jump over the dead body of a security guard on her way before crawling under a stage only a few feet high . From there , she texted her sister-in-law who was watching her kids : \" OMG , there 's tons of gunshots and people dead everywhere . \" 1:20 p.m. Witness accounts of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history include those of a Las Vegas woman wounded in the shoulder made it to a hospital and an Arizona man upset that the lights came on at an outdoor concert when gunfire started and people began falling . The unidentified Glendale , Arizona man says people at the Oct. 1 concert on the Las Vegas Strip were \" lit up like a fishbowl . \" Witness ' names were blacked out from more than 1,200 pages of reports made public Wednesday by Las Vegas police . The wounded woman told police she heard what people told her were fireworks while country music singer Jason Aldean was on stage . Several seconds later , she fell to the ground and could n't feel her arm . Her friends got her to a street where a limousine driver took them to a hospital where she remembered people in hallways on stretchers and hospital staff unable to take names of patients because there were so many of them . 12:05 p.m. Police in Las Vegas have released a DVD that the department says contains witness statements and officer reports about last year 's mass shooting that killed 58 people and injured hundreds on the Las Vegas Strip . The information made public Wednesday follows a court battle by The Associated Press and other media organizations to obtain public records about the Oct. 1 massacre that was the deadliest event of its kind in modern U.S. history . Police two weeks ago released video from two officers ' body-worn cameras showing police blasting through the door of the 32nd-floor hotel suite where authorities say the gunman opened fire from windows and killed himself before officers arrived . The police department opposed releasing the information , calling the public records request costly and time-consuming . 7:55 a.m. Police in Las Vegas plan to make public witness statements and officer reports about last year 's mass shooting that killed 58 people and injured hundreds in what was the deadliest event of its kind in modern U.S. history . The scheduled release of documents on Wednesday comes more than seven months after the Oct. 1 Las Vegas Strip shooting .

We talked about that show a lot , as a template , obviously , of a great show , Fey told The New York Times in 2007 , but also a show that is all about the relationships in the workplace , but not the making of television so much . Born Dec. 29 , 1936 , in Brooklyn , Moore danced in dishwasher commercials , and bared her legs on the 1950s P.I. series Richard Diamond before achieving stardom with her role as a housewife in New Rochelle , New York . On The Dick Van Dyke Show , Moore was Laura Petrie , the supportive suburban spouse of TV writer Rob , played by namesake star Dick Van Dyke . Considered the smartest TV comedy of its day , the 1961-66 series led Moore to the first two of her seven career acting Emmys . After its run , Moore worked in film , most notably in the 1967 Julie Andrews musical , Thoroughly Modern Millie , and most notoriously in the 1969 Elvis Presley vehicle , Change of Habit . In 1970 , The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted . The first episode saw Moore s Mary Richards , fresh from a broken engagement , take a job in the newsroom at Minneapolis WJM-TV . In the pilot , she declared her independence by spurning her former fianc the sentiment was reiterated in each week s opening credits when Mary was seen tossing a tam into the air as the theme song declared , You re gon na make it after all ! ( In 2002 , Moore was present for the unveiling of a bronze statue in Minneapolis that immortalized that iconic hat throw . ) Ratings , though still strong , slipped in Mary Tyler Moore Show s sixth season , and just as Carl Reiner ended The Dick Van Dyke Show before it lost its luster , Moore decided her sitcom s seventh season would be its last . Related : Watch Mary Tyler Moore in Scenes From Her Greatest Film Performances In 1980 , Moore put Mary Richards in deep freeze to star in Robert Redford s Ordinary People . The jarring portrayal of a withholding , bitter mother earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination , and , for a time , a renewed film career . Meanwhile MTM Enterprises , which Moore founded in 1969 with then-husband Grant Tinker , produced a number of well-regarded shows into the 1980s , each ending with the company s signature kitten meow . Off-camera , Moore was private and more reserved than her public persona . I tend not to be quite as optimistic as Mary Richards , she said in 1980 . In her 1995 memoir , After All , she revealed that she had been molested by a family friend at the age of 6 . When she was 33 , soon after suffering a miscarriage , Moore was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a condition she would battle the rest of her life a condition she would battle the rest of her life . She also struggled with addictions to alcohol and Valium . The cruelest blow came in 1980 when Richard C. Meeker Jr. , Moore s only child , died of an accidental , self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 24 . Looking back , Moore said she was happy to have been a Mary Richards role model for one generation , just as she was happy to have been a Laura Petrie role model for another . In 2002 , Moore called The Mary Tyler Moore Show the best seven years of my life . In 1988 , her sister , Elizabeth , died at age 21 from a drug overdose . And her brother , John , died of liver cancer in 1992 at age 47 .",

		"paragraph": "By Ben Hirschler LONDON ( Reuters ) - A common blood pressure and heart drug manufactured in bulk by a Chinese company and sold worldwide may have contained an impurity linked to cancer since 2012 , European regulators said on Tuesday . The revelation that the problem likely dates back to changes in manufacturing processes at Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical six years ago suggests many patients could potentially have been exposed to cancer risk . The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , which first raised the alarm over the Chinese supplied valsartan on July 5 , said it was now working to establish how long and at what levels patients might have been exposed to the impurity known as NDMA . NDMA , or N-nitrosodimethylamine , is classified as a probable human carcinogen . Based on results from laboratory tests , it may cause cancer with long-term use . \" It is still too early to provide information on the longer term risk NDMA may have posed for patients . EMA has made this aspect of the review a priority and will update the public as soon as new information becomes available , \" the agency said . EU authorities have been recalling medicines containing valsartan from Zhejiang Huahai over the past two weeks and the EMA said such medicines should no longer be available in pharmacies . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also took action to recall affected valsartan-containing medicines on Friday . Zhejiang Huahai has already acknowledged that there was an impurity in some of its valsartan , which it said had sales of $ 50 million in 2017 . Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment outside of regular business hours on the fact the problem might date back to 2012 . The EMA said NDMA was an unexpected impurity that was not detected by routine tests carried out by Zhejiang Huahai , adding that the manufacturing changes introduced in 2012 were believed to have produced NDMA as a by-product . RELIANCE ON CHINA The case shows the reliance of consumers around the world on medicines containing active pharmaceutical ingredients made in China . Regulators have been stepping up oversight of foreign factories in recent years to try and ensure the quality of drugs made in China and India , which is another major supplier to global drug markets . But it remains a work in progress , as highlighted by the EMA 's Executive Director Guido Rasi , who wrote recently in the agency 's annual report : \" We need to think globally and work strategically with partners from around the world to make best use of our inspection capacity , so that patients can rely on the quality , safety and efficacy of all medicines , no matter where they have been manufactured . \" Valsartan was originally developed by Novartis and the Swiss company marketed it as Diovan , but it is now off patent and is used in a number of generic medicines supplied by various companies . In addition to tackling high blood pressure , it is also prescribed to treat heart failure . Zhejiang Huahai , which was founded in 1989 and listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2003 , was one of the first Chinese companies to get drugs approved in the U.S. market . It makes active ingredients for a number of different medicines to treat heart problems , depression , allergies and HIV , according to its website . Overall , more than two-thirds of all active drug ingredients originate in China and India , industry experts estimate , with China accounting for the lion 's share . ( Reporting by Ben Hirschler .

		"paragraph": "By Ryan Woo and David Lawder BEIJING/WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $ 16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment , the Chinese commerce ministry said , as the world 's largest economies escalated their trade dispute . The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23 , the ministry said , the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $ 16 billion of Chinese goods . The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday . China 's final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June , which included crude oil . The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft , although the total value is unchanged . The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions , after Washington imposed tariffs on $ 34 billion in goods last month . China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action . \" This is a very unreasonable practice , \" the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China 's counter-tariffs . To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil , China added fish meal , wood waste , paper and paper waste , metal scraps , and various types of bicycles and cars , among other products . Last week , China proposed additional tariffs on another $ 60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent . So far , China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $ 110 billion of U.S. goods , representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products . Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft . A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative 's office could not immediately be reached for comment on China 's retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump 's next round of threatened tariffs on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods . USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs , which could reach 25 percent , due to end Sept. 5 . It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties . Gary Hufbauer , a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions . \" My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $ 250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections . That 's soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument , but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019 . Of course , China will retaliate , probably dollar for dollar , \" Hufbauer said . China , however , would run out of U.S. imports to levy , as it bought only $ 130 billion worth of American goods last year . It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference .

		"paragraph": "It was like a waterfall , continuously , Kendra Jackson told KETV in Omaha , Neb. , of the years-long runny nose that she recently learned was a brain leak . Everywhere I went , I always had a box of Puffs . Jackson , who was officially diagnosed with a cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leak , remembers the chronic runny nose starting back in 2013 , after a minor car accident caused her head to slam into the dashboard . Although she walked away mostly unscathed , the incident left Jackson with intermittent headaches and a runny nose so frequent that she was almost constantly wielding tissues . Over the years she d seen a variety of doctors , most of whom attributed it to allergies . But when she felt the condition worsening in recent months , causing fatigue and dizziness , Jackson wondered if something else might be wrong This month , thanks to doctors at Nebraska Medicine , she learned what was . While examining her brain through an MRI , doctors identified a small hole at the base of her skull that was causing brain fluid leak out of her nose . In total , she was losing a half-pint of cerebrospinal fluid a day . While in years past , a diagnosis of CSF leak would require open-brain surgery , the condition can now be treated using a minimally invasive surgery through the nose . In Jackson s case , this involved plugging the hole with fatty tissue from another part of her body . The surgery , which Nebraska Medicine captured in video , went well and Jackson is now recovering . I do n t have to carry around the tissue anymore , she told KETV in a post-surgery interview . And I m getting some sleep . So what exactly is a CSF leak , and is it something you should be worried about ? According to the Cleveland Clinic , a CSF leak results when the the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain ( called cerebrospinal fluid ) leaks through a hole that has developed in the skull bone . The hole can be caused by trauma , such as a head injury , or simply occur spontaneously . The main symptoms , on top of watery drainage from the nose , are vision changes , dizziness , headaches , and hearing loss . The condition is both rare and treatable . Dr. Satish Govindaraj , chief of the Division of Rhinology and Sinus Surgery for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York , is one of the leading doctors in the field of CSF leaks . Together with his team at Mount Sinai , he has pioneered a high resolution CT/MRI fusion technique that allows doctors to better locate the actual site of the CSF leak . As someone intimately connected to this subject , Govindaraj does n t seem particularly surprised by Jackson s story . It can happen in someone who has a history of trauma , such as a motor vehicle accident , Govindaraj tells Yahoo Lifestyle . They might have a fracture and they did n t even know it . To test for the condition , Govindaraj and his team use a serum that can detect brain fluid . But just because someone has a consistently runny nose does n t mean they need this test . On top of noting that it s an incredibly rare condition , Govindaraj raises an important distinction about the symptom of watery drainage . It would be specifically coming from one side , he says . It s extremely rare to have a leak on both sides , so it s clear drainage from one side that should raise a red flag . But even if it is coming from one side , that may not be cause for alarm . If it s brain fluid , it would be almost like straight water like the fluid out of a facet , he says . It s not something where someone has allergies they should run to the doctor and check if they have this . In terms of what s actually causing it , Govindaraj likens it to a pressure cooker in need of a release valve . When the brain fluid pressure builds , it becomes trapped in the skull , so it ends up leaking where the bone is thinnest , he says , mentioning the part where our smell nerves connect to our brains . That hole acts as a decompression . Although the leak itself is n t necessarily dangerous since the body routinely creates brain fluid having it exposed to the nasal cavity , which can transport infections , is dangerous . So surgery to plug the hole is recommended immediately . Doing so can bring on more headaches , since the pressure has nowhere to go , but Govindaraj says that s the next and final step : We have to manage that pressure .

		"paragraph": "By Henning Gloystein and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) to China in July fell to their lowest level in a year and are expected to decline further as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute forces utilities to seek alternative supplies . In an escalating trade dispute , China last week said it may slap a 25 percent import tariff on U.S. LNG supplies in retaliation to a raft of duties on Chinese goods that U.S. President Donald Trump has announced since June . \" The import tax will make U.S. exports of LNG uncompetitive , \" energy research group Bernstein said in a note this week . Traders said Chinese buyers were already seeking alternatives . \" The Chinese are already indicating that they would prefer not to take U.S. cargoes for any new spot deals , \" said a Singapore-based energy trader who deals with Chinese LNG importers . He declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak publicly about commercial operations . The main beneficiaries of this shift are producers in the Asia/Pacific region , who have been quick to snatch market share from the United States since the trade disputes broke out in June . \" Short-term , alternative volumes could come from many other projects including the more proximate Australian , Papua New Guinean ( PNG ) and Qatari projects which have some flexible volumes , \" said Saul Kavonic , Director of Asia/Pacific Markets and head of energy research for Australia at Credit Suisse . Graphic : Major LNG suppliers to China ( https://reut.rs/2Mt6hBx ) Shipping data shows that U.S. LNG sales to China have already slumped from almost 400,000 tonnes in May to just 130,000 tonnes in July , while supplies from Australia , Malaysia , Indonesia , Russia and Papua New Guinea have increased . U.S. LNG exports only started in 2015 , and sales to China were a booming business opportunity for the American natural gas industry . They were also a convenient tool to reduce the American trade deficit with China . Analysts said U.S. LNG sellers such as Cheniere <LNG.A> would still be able to find a home for its supplies , including in Europe . Still , they warned that the spat with China could stall planned future U.S. export projects that were hoping to sell into China . \" While Chinese tariffs will not halt the United States 's rise to be among the world 's top-3 largest LNG exporters , they could slow or stop the progress of some projects ... reducing the overall weighting of U.S. LNG in the global LNG mix over the next decade , \" said Credit Suisse 's Kavonic .

Now Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are reportedly engaged after dating for only a month . People promptly freaked out about the latest news on Twitter : Grande defended the newly engaged couple and her own speedy engagement on Twitter in response to criticism from a fan who insinuated that both her and Bieber s engagements were orchestrated by their joint manager , Scooter Braun : Research has found that divorce can be contagious , and , it seems , quickie engagements can be too for celebrities and noncelebrities alike . The danger of celebrity behavior is that strangely it can normalize less than optimal behaviors , licensed clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula , author of Should I Stay or Should I Go ? , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . If a celebrity can get engaged in one month , why ca n t the rest of us ? Here s the good news : Quick engagements are usually more contagious among a group of friends , licensed clinical psychologist John Mayer , author of Family Fit : Find Your Balance in Life , tells Yahoo Lifestyle , although some people may see these speedy celebrity engagements as normalizing the whole thing . And any time a new norm is set , people are more likely to behave the same way , Durvasula says . Durvasula says it s entirely possible that these are just publicity stunts and that these couples are n t thinking about forever . But it s also possible that they really do think getting engaged this quickly is a good idea . Technically , engagements were once intended to be a period to work out the kinks in the relationship and start to create a life together , Mayer points out . But there s really no need for the engagement at all , given that couples can now get to know each other just fine without an engagement , Durvasula says . For most people it is highly unlikely that in one month they can make an informed decision as to spending the next 60 years with a person , she says . It can also take attention away from some of the heavier aspects of a relationship , like learning to compromise , communicate , and respect each other , and make it more about party planning , Durvasula says . If a couple really feels that a fast engagement is right for them , it s a good idea to plan on having a long engagement , Mayer says . Durvasula agrees . Do not even set a date or start planning a wedding yet , as that can distract from the actual relationship building , she says . Just treat it as a relationship with more substantial jewelry in it . Durvasula also recommends getting to know each other more and talking openly and honestly about each other s future desires including kids , careers , and finances . Be honest . Do not do a bait-and-switch hoping that things will work their way out someday , Durvasula says . That can be very painful someday .

My goal has always been to be in the Hall of Fame , to win trophies , to leave a legacy way beyond any money that you make . Beckham insisted the contract talks were never a distraction to him , and his willingness to play nice by showing up for voluntary work and training camp certainly helped the process along . I just wanted to get the contract done , he said . It s not like it s gon na change the way that I want to play and the way that I want to perform . . . . It just was a matter of when . I knew that I was already taken care of before this happened . He also said he did n t necessarily feel more pressure or responsibility , and his reputation as one of the team s hardest workers preceded the negotiations . That does n t mean the Giants wo n t expect a return on their investment .",

		"paragraph": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge s third child arrived on Monday and the little prince looks nearly identical to his adorable siblings , Prince George and Princess Charlotte . The parents gave excited fans their first glimpse of the newborn baby just hours after his birth when they stepped out onto the pavement outside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary s hospital to head home . And as photographs emerged of close-ups of the hours-old baby boy , people could n t get over just how much he looks like the royal couple s other kids at the same ripe young age . Snuggled up in a white knit hat and a matching white shawl , which are from design house GH Hurt & Son Ltd. , the baby looked totally unperturbed by the hundreds of waiting photographers and screaming fans . Just like Prince George back in 2013 , the little royal held his tiny hands up above the blanket as his doting mom smiled down at him . However , it s clear that while the baby may have Prince George s button nose , he s the spitting image of his sister , Princess Charlotte , who was born in 2015 . Just like her younger brother , Princess Charlotte was also swaddled in a blanket by GH Hurt & Son Ltd. and a little bonnet hat which tied underneath her chin . Indeed , the two-year-old seemed ecstatic when she was pictured holding hands with her father , Prince William , as he brought her in to meet her new brother . Beaming from ear-to-ear , Princess Charlotte waved like a pro as she skipped into the Lindo Wing . Meanwhile , Prince George , who was dressed in his school uniform , seemed shy as he kept his head down outside the wing .

		"paragraph": "If you have n t heard of Jillian Mercado yet , you will soon . This model , activist , and fashionista is now preparing to enter the acting world , and her track record for hard work and major success is nothing short of inspirational . Mercado is intimidating not only because of her striking good looks and unique experiments with style her hair is almost always a different length and color but also for the inner confidence and passion she exudes when she enters a room . Mercado is one of the first highly successful models with a disability and has worked to represent the large population of people with disabilities who have been historically excluded from the fashion world . Growing up on New York City s Upper West Side , the daughter of a dressmaker and a sometimes shoe salesman , Mercado was a little girl in love with the fashion industry . By the age of 3 , she was in a wheelchair with what was eventually diagnosed as spastic muscular dystrophy . She never saw models who looked like her and took it upon herself to pioneer a change . At 30 years old , and with credits that include high-ranking campaigns for giant companies like Diesel and Nordstrom , and as the face of Beyonc s online store , Mercado has transcended the boundaries she observed as a kid and built a fanbase of 85,000 followers on Instagram . She uses her platform to post live makeup tutorials and workouts , as well as to share basic frustrations on such topics as discomfort over people staring at her while on the street and a lack of accessibility on the subway . Many supportive comments come from people across the globe , thanking her for paving the way . Yahoo Lifestyle spoke with Mercado about how she pursues her dreams . Though she says modeling and fashion are still her first loves , she is now , with the help of her high-powered reps at the William Morris Endeavor talent agency , delving into the acting world and she s ready to make some big waves . Yahoo Lifestyle : Your modeling agency , IMG , represents everyone from Gisele B ndchen to Kate Moss to Heidi Klum . How has your career changed since you started working with IMG a few years ago ? Jillian Mercado : First of all , let s just sit with that comment real quick ! Being in an agency with those iconic models , it just shows you how diverse the agency actually is . My life has changed so much since being signed with the biggest agency in the world . Not only do they fight for me in my mission to diversify fashion , but they are also family to me . It s rare to have an agency that truly cares for each and every one of their models , and it s a blessing , to be honest . Most importantly , they believe in me . They believe that little by little we do need to realize that inclusion is very important . It s something that I talk about all the time . This industry has a reputation for not always being a positive place for women , but it seems you ve really found a sense of belonging there . What do you attribute that to ? It s very true , and I think that we are in a great time of our lives where we can be vocal about it . I ve always loved the fashion industry everything about it : the good , the bad , and the crazy . I m a visual person , and it enriches my mind every single day . I feel at home every time I do anything regarding fashion , and I think the love that I have for the industry helps me prove to people that it does not have to be negative all the time . It goes beyond the industry : Yes , I do love the fashion world , but I think that being positive in a place that has a reputation of negativity really helps the soul . If you love what you do , that energy will travel miles and eventually all around the world . I surround myself with positive energy everywhere because honestly , I do n t have time for negativity . No one should . What is a main struggle you still face in the modeling world as a person with a disability ? Has anything improved since you started ? I honestly think that whoever started with the idea of categorizing having a disability as a negative thing really affected everyone s mind . It s all about perception . Sure , there are moments where I struggle a lot being someone who has a disability , but whoever is reading this and has a different lifestyle than the general public knows that we are very creative people . It s how we survive . So I use that creativity in the modeling world as well , mentally and physically . We are starting a conversation about inclusivity . So hopefully I am shining a huge light on it to continue to move it forward it s literally just the beginning , and there is much work left to do . What made you want to try to branch out into acting ? It has always frustrated me when people who do not have a disability get hired to play somebody with a disability , rather than someone who has that disability to begin with . I always believe that if you have an opportunity to do something , go for it . Yes ! I have the privilege to say that I m also signed to WME , which is another huge entertainment agency . I have worked so hard to get to where I am , so if I let this opportunity go , it would be absolutely my fault . So I m diving in ! How do you think Hollywood can take steps toward normalizing diversity ? Social media has definitely helped with creating conversations about normalizing diversity and inclusion . People are tired of not seeing themselves in mass media . It gets boring after a while , and I think we ve just reached a breaking point . Our voices are being heard in every part of the world . Since I m always someone who puts positivity first , I know that Hollywood can and will ! While I m alive and well , I will never stop talking about it , and I know that others have followed in continuing the conversation . It s not OK to not want to diversify what we can see in the media . What are some of the excuses you feel casting directors use for not hiring disabled actors ? There are many excuses that I ve heard from casting directors that confuse me . It s easy for people not to open the conversation up because it s always been this way , but not healing the wounds will only make them bigger and worse for everyone . It s not OK when the third most sizable minority in the world is not being represented in mass media . It s just not OK . I ve heard things like It s not in the budget , assuming that I need an assistant or that I wo n t be able to memorize lines . To be honest , if I needed an assistant , that s still no excuse . I am very sure that when they hire actors or actresses who played someone with a disability , they have to hire a coach to do so . So right there , it s a really bad excuse . We all should have the opportunity to be great in any career we choose . If we are talented , that should be enough . Your disability should n t be a roadblock but something that enhances you as a person . Think of it as a chance to be creative . Besides , movies that have the conversation of disability in them have won Academy Awards , so we know they can make money . That s a fact ! There have been a lot of conversations on what language we should be using when discussing disabilities . What language do you prefer ? Yes , this conversation is one of my favorite ones to have because it s so important that people realize that we have been labeled for such a long time that people assume we all prefer the same language . It s unfair to assume , so I always suggest that people ask . If you must call me something other than my own name , I prefer you say that I have a disability . For example , Jillian , who has a disability â€¦ I do n t identify myself with any other form than that one . Not because all the other words make me feel less-than , but just because this is better for me . I know many people who have different preferences , and that s OK as well just ask them . Your career path has taken so many thrilling leaps . What has been the highlight if you had to pick one ? It really has , and I m extremely excited to see what the future holds for me . Definitely stay tuned on my website manufactured1987.com because I will be venturing off into an exciting new journey , and that information will only be available on that site . There are so many highlights of my life as a model . Being a muse for Beyonc was definitely one , but she was second to meeting the Obamas and being able to visit the White House three times experiences which I will never , ever forget .

		"paragraph": "Diego Maradona is sometimes regarded as the greatest player in the history of soccer . The Argentine legend , who led the South American nation to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986 , has been a constant presence when Argentina has played at the World Cup in Russia this summer . But while Maradona may still be regarded as a legend , his antics in the stands at this World Cup have been somewhat less decorous than his playing career , which in addition to the World Cup , saw him claim two Serie A titles with Napoli and a Copa del Rey with Barcelona . Here he s seen dancing with what may be a journalist ahead of Wednesday s do-or-die meeting between Lionel Messi s Argentina and Nigeria . And here he is at the same match unfurling an enormous banner featuring . . . Diego Maradona . He also apparently paid tribute to Kate Winslet by reenacting one of the English actress iconic moments from the movie Titanic . OK , so maybe he was praying for an Argentina win there . If he was praying , current Argentina legend Lionel Messi answered with a brilliant goal early on in Argentina s crucial Group D match against Nigeria on Tuesday . Messi has been subject to constant comparisons between himself and Maradona throughout his career . While Messi s accomplishments at the club level absolutely dwarf Maradona s , the fact that the Barcelona No. 10 has yet to win a World Cup is constantly used to diminish his accomplishments and to extend the narrative that Maradona is somehow better than him . For the sake of all of us , let s hope that Messi and Co. are successful and go all the way at this World Cup , finally removing the albatross that is Maradona s legacy from over the head of Argentina . Otherwise , we might have to continue to contend with scenes like this . Or this . Or this . Or this .

		"paragraph": "Everything changed for Brandon Ingram when the Lakers put the ball in his hands . There had always been opportunities for Ingram to create , but never quite so consistently or quite so explicitly as when Luke Walton made the second-year forward a part-time point guard . \" When Luke gave me his vision , he just told me he wanted me to be aggressive , \" Ingram told CBS Sports last season . \" Always , whether it 's driving to the basket for myself or creating for my teammates . He just wanted me to try to push the pace and be who I am . \" Or , perhaps , to become something more . As a rookie , Ingram would often drift out of focus when not directly involved in a play 's progression as if fading into the background on the weak side . Entrusting Ingram with more creative responsibility was a means of engagement . Every touch was a tether to the moment , demanding of Ingram a presence and focus that did n't always come naturally . From that sense of direction came the best stretch of Ingram 's impressive sophomore season . Next comes the more complicated work of learning to live without it . LeBron James is a Laker , which is to say that the offense is his . It might begin with Rajon Rondo or Lonzo Ball , but the Lakers did not pursue the best player in basketball so that he might sit idle . He is at the center of the frame , the core of every concept . Your entire universe changes the moment that LeBron commits to play for your team . Those like Ingram are left to deal with the developmental whiplash . The appeal of an up-and-coming point forward is offset by the arrival of the definitive version . After all , why would a decorated team with winning priorities invest so much for Ingram to do things that James can do better ? This is the fundamental conundrum of LeBron . No superstar brings greater scrutiny , largely because none has the same effect . Yet because of that scrutiny , LeBron 's teams tend to lean on his scoring and playmaking to an untenable degree . That most any team would welcome that dilemma does n't make it any less of one . To put it plainly , there is nothing quite like playing with LeBron . What touches Ingram gets next season will come through a very different course . Many more of them will be secondary actions quick , decisive extensions of a play already made . The physical location of Ingram 's shots and moves could change as a result , tilting his game away from the middle of the floor and more toward the wings . Opportunities to survey the floor will likely be all but gone . So much of Ingram 's involvement stands to change , from timing to placement to utility . All of which will bring Ingram 's off-ball limitations to the fore . Ingram was empowered to create for himself partly as a developmental exercise , but also because his skill set pointed naturally in that direction . His cuts are n't ineffective so much as inorganic . His perimeter shooting is n't without promise , though its promise has yet to pay off . Passivity is the byproduct of a player through a lack of instinct or experience not quite understanding how to consistently put their skills to practice . Ingram , like so many 20-year-olds before him , suffers for it . Ingram is where the theory of building a team around James veers from the reality . So versatile is LeBron that any sort of player should fit alongside him . Shooters eat well off of James 's crosscourt passes . Bigs and cutters find vacated lanes to the rim in working off of LeBron 's drives . Other creators , too , have become collaborators Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving chief among them . Ingram floats between those possibilities , teasing at all of them but fulfilling none . It 's one thing to intrigue , but quite another to offer real , tangible benefit to a team in the heat of contention . Soon Ingram will learn the difference .",

		"paragraph": "Trigger warning : This essay discusses memories of rape . There are many upsetting aspects to the backlash Christine Blasey Ford , Ph.D. is facing after publicly confirming her accusation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh . Journalist Ronan Farrow , who broke the story in the New Yorker , said Ford alleges that during high school , Brett Kavanaugh held her down and attempted to force himself on her , placing a hand over her mouth and turning up music to conceal her protests . One of the most harmful responses is doubt about whether Judge Kavanaugh and men like him deserve lifelong consequences for their bad behavior back in high school , for their so-called rough horseplay . Comments like these are dangerous : They minimize sexual abusers actions , deny the reality of rampant sexual abuse in our culture , and downplay the long-term impact of sexual violence on survivors . The truth is grim . One in five women will be raped in their lifetime and one in four girls will be sexually abused before they turn 18 years old . Of those victims , 50 % will develop post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a disorder that comes with daunting mental , physical , and emotional symptoms . Sexual assault is not 20 minutes of action , nor is it an isolated incident . It s a federal crime that can result in trauma serious enough to alter the rest of a survivor s life . When I was a sophomore , I was in a relationship with a guy my age . We were both 16 years old and often drunk , on love and liquor . I was pretty but insecure , trying to fit in with the cool crowd . He was mischievous with a kind smile and seemed to know a lot more about the world than I did . I trusted him , so I let him show me the world through his eyes . After a year or so of being together , I began considering losing my virginity to him . I loved him intimately , we had fun together , and most of all , he had my trust . He was , supposedly , good . One night while at a house party , we crept upstairs to a bedroom to mess around . With Dashboard Confessional whining in the background , we sat on the bed and started making out . Before I knew it , we were under the sheets getting hot and heavy . As we kissed , I said to him , I do n t want to have sex tonight . He murmured something , and I assumed it was settled . The next thing I knew , he was on top of me , inside me . We were having sex . No , I said in his ear , I did n t want to have sex tonight . He ignored me , continued having sex with me , and kissed my neck . I felt blood rush to my face . I was flush with embarrassment . I looked down and saw that I was still wearing my bra . It was lilac , lace , and had little pink flowers on it . It s my fault , I thought . I d worn my sexy bra , so he must ve taken that as an unspoken sign that I wanted it . Just like that , my virginity was gone , against my consent . This is n t a particularly violent story , considering the way we mistakenly view rape as being something that can only be done to a girl in a back alley at knifepoint . During the months after my rape , I quietly began stealing and snorting my brother s Adderall . I made a hobby of getting blackout drunk , and I spent days contemplating the different ways I could kill myself . A decade later , I d developed a reliance on cocaine and alcohol , leaving me vulnerable to continued sexual abuse in college . Today I still battle suicidal thoughts I have severe anxiety and hypervigilance , which makes being alone a nightmare . When I am misunderstood , I have fight to temper my rage and communicate calmly with those I love . It s been 20 years since that night in high school , and I m just beginning to get a handle on my past and its toll on my present . It has taken me this long to confront my trauma . I have the rest of my life to cope with it . If a man who has sexually harassed women loses his comedy career , great . If a habitual sexual predator loses his talk show , brilliant . The pain and embarrassment they feel as they slip away from their positions of power is savagely fair and yet hardly sufficient . If you think professional punishment for adults who have been abusive in their pasts is too harsh , you ve yet to fully understand the all-encompassing suffering that assault survivors face each day : You ca n t walk past a door without wondering if an attacker is about to jump out from behind it . You ca n t enter your own home after dark without questioning your safety . You ca n t hear the simple twinge of a water pipe or rustling leaves without breaking a sweat . Quite plainly , once you ve been assaulted , you ca n t ever completely escape that moment and its terror . It follows you , in your subconscious , weaving through your days no matter how old you were when it started . Age does n t excuse victims pain , and it does n t excuse men like Judge Brett Kavanaugh , who were boys when they allegedly disregarded women like Christine Blasey Ford , Ph.D. when they were girls . So take these men s jobs , take their dreams , take their success , trash it all . If predators are not in jail for their crimes against women , then they can lose their careers , at the very least . Because , to me , what they actually deserve is a lot worse . If you are a sexual assault survivor and need help , you can call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to speak to a trained counselor . You can also chat online with a counselor here . Both services are available 24/7 .",

		"paragraph": "LOS ANGELES The most controversial subplot of the 2017 World Series got a second act in Game 7 as Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel met Los Angeles Dodgers starter Yu Darvish for the first time since Game 3 , which is when Gurriel was caught making a slanted-eye gesture about Darvish . This time around , Gurriel tried his best to make amends . Before the first pitch of his at-bat against Darvish in the first inning , Gurriel stopped and tipped his helmet to Darvish . Here s how it played out : Gurriel was suspended for five games by Major League Baseball for the incident , but the suspension wo n t take place until the start of the 2018 season , leaving Gurriel free to play in the World Series for Houston . This did n t sit well with many people , Dodgers fans and otherwise . So Gurriel has been booed relentlessly since the series came back to Dodger Stadium . In Game 6 , Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill purposely took his time on the mound when Gurriel was at-bat , giving fans more time to boo him . After the game , Hill called it a silent gesture to show how he felt about Gurriel s actions toward Darvish . Darvish did n t appear to react in the moment to Gurriel s helmet tip . Previously , Darvish had shown compassion to Gurriel and the situation , saying he hoped people would learn from Gurriel s mistake . The night of the incident , Darvish said in a statement on Twitter : Gurriel trying to make amends does n t mean people have to forget what he did or forgive him and many people wo n t .

		"paragraph": "Morgan Freeman is speaking out following allegations of sexual harassment by eight women . Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy , the award-winning actor , 80 , tells Yahoo Entertainment . I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected that was never my intent . CNN ran a story on Thursday in which eight women accused the Driving Miss Daisy and Shawshank Redemption actor of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior , including unwanted touching . The news outlet also spoke to eight other women who witnessed Freeman s alleged misconduct . According to the story , These 16 people together described a pattern of inappropriate behavior by Freeman on set , while promoting his movies , and at his production company Revelations Entertainment . The allegations centered around Freeman commenting on the women s bodies and clothing choices , as well as touching them , all of which made the women including production assistants and reporters at his movie junkets uncomfortable at work . The only victim identified was CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas , who co-authored the article the rest of the women spoke anonymously . One of the stories told was by a young production assistant from the 2017 film Going in Style , who said that Freeman made comments about her figure and clothing on a daily basis for months and repeatedly touched her back without her permission . One time , she said , he kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear . Because of the experience , the assistant said she decided to leave the movie industry . It was constant comments about the way I looked , she said . Former staffers at Revelations , which Freeman founded in 1996 , talked about a toxic work environment . Six people said they witnessed Freeman s questionable behavior around women , including sexual comments and one incident involving unwanted touching . When one the people met the actor for the first time , on the set of Through the Wormhole , she said Freeman looked me up and down before asking , How do you feel about sexual harassment ? Another former staffer said he would walk over to her desk and blatantly stare at her breasts . â€˜ Do n t worry that s just Morgan , ' she was told . Yet another story was related by a man who said he saw Freeman massaging an intern who got visibly red and wiggled out of his grasp it was awkward . A writer for Madam Secretary , which is produced by Revelations , reported witnessing Freeman s so-called office antics specifically Freeman leering at female staffers at a birthday party for him at the office . We saw Morgan go around to the girls â€¦ and get really close to their faces he did n t do it to the men , the person recalled . I do n t know what he said , but we all thought it was strange and could n t wait to get the hell out of there . Absolutely there were sexual undertones to it . After the #MeToo movement began , the same writer said they knew that Morgan would be the next person to be called out . This behavior did n t go unnoticed by men . A former male Revelations employee told CNN he heard Freeman making inappropriate comments . [ He d say ] things like , â€˜ I d like to have an hour with her or make vulgar and sexual comments about women , the person said . He would be verbally inappropriate , and it was just shocking . You re more shocked than anything because it s hard to have the wherewithal to say to him , â€˜ That s inappropriate . You re just like , â€˜ Whoa . It s hard because on any set he is the most powerful person on it . It s weird because you just do n t expect it from Morgan Freeman , someone who you respect . Several of the former staffers suggested Revelations Entertainment co-founder Lori McCreary did n t do enough . CNN s Melas shared her own experience with Freeman , saying that when she was interviewing him at the Going in Style junket while she was six months pregnant , he looked her up and down and made comments that left her feeling upset . â€˜ Boy , do I wish I was there , ' she remembered him saying , as well as , You are ripe . ( Part of the exchange was recorded . ) Because of that encounter , Melas started making calls to see whether other women had experienced similar behavior with Freeman . Most of the accusers told CNN they did n t report Freeman s alleged harassment because they feared for their jobs . Instead , they came up with ways to combat it , including dressing in loose clothing . Melas did report the incident , and her supervisor agreed that she would not cover the movie . On Thursday , following the CNN story , Vancouver s transit authority , TransLink , announced that it is pausing announcements featuring Freeman s voice . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Former White House lawyer Ty Cobb on Monday said he does n t buy President Donald Trump s claim that the ongoing special counsel investigation is a witch hunt . Special counsel Robert Mueller s ongoing probe is investigating , among other things , whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to help its candidate win the 2016 presidential election . Trump and his allies have repeatedly called the investigation a witch hunt and denied that there was collusion . The president has on a number of occasions floated the idea of firing Mueller . Cobb , who stepped down from his post as White House lawyer in May , told host Gloria Borger at CNN s CITIZEN Conference in New York on Monday that he rejects the president s analysis of the probe . He also praised Mueller , who he said he has respected for decades . Bob Mueller is an American hero in my view , Cobb said during a panel with Jack Quinn , who served as White House lawyer under former President Bill Clinton . He was a very serious prosecutor . He and I first met in the mid - 80s when we were prosecuting different places , and I have respected him throughout . During his tenure at the White House , Cobb was the lead attorney dealing with requests from the special counsel .

		"paragraph": "On July 10 , leadership within the U.S. Navy took to Facebook Live to announce revolutionary updates to the military branch s hair policy . Servicewomen would now be allowed to wear hairstyles such as braids , ponytails , and locs , which were previously banned . In this first-person essay , Lt. Tiffany D. Pearson explains how these changes affect her life as a black woman in the Navy . We can wear ponytails and locs in uniform tomorrow ?! I could n t believe what I was reading the U.S. Navy was finally allowing the heretofore unimaginable , a new shift in hair regulations . Though I ve recently opted for a low fade , I celebrated with black women throughout the fleet when I learned yet another style intrinsic to my heritage and conducive to healthy hair was no longer deemed unprofessional . For me , this policy shift was a d tente of sorts an easing of tension between my natural hair and Navy regulations . Reconciliation between my service and myself has removed the burden competing factors once presented . The new Navy policy sets forth the most significant changes to the hair grooming regulations I ve seen in my eight years of enlisted and commissioned service . The policy seems to take into consideration the multicultural diversity of the U.S. Navy . It offers a broader and more inclusive version of what it means to look professional . The chief of naval operations ( CNO ) made the announcement regarding this ambitious policy change surrounded by black female sailors who took part in the policy working group . In many ways , that video symbolized for me a shift in perspective . It showed me a Navy comprised of sailors from all walks of life , socioeconomic statuses , and backgrounds . By including a number of diverse voices in the policy process , the Navy was able to produce a far-reaching policy that brought about more equity a recognition that there is nothing inherently unprofessional about my hair in its natural state . Valuing core facets of each sailor elicits a sense of dignity , as they serve with honor , courage , and commitment . No need to sacrifice personhood to do so . I entered Navy training in 2011 with a low-cut fade and a desire for adventure . One year , a few relaxers , and many days of hat hair later , I decided transitioning back to my natural curls was a must . The response was not good . Did you stick your finger in a light socket ? asked a senior officer . I d planned to take a year in transitioning , but the constant negative feedback resulted in a swift cut a small Afro that drew fewer comments and less scrutiny . Of course , I was no stranger to changing my hair , but growing up , I d never encountered issues like this . Having a new look was the norm in my neighborhood , where no one had ever asked if , perhaps , a new hairstyle would be better . My mother , who doubled as my hairstylist when the financial luxury of salon visits was not an option , was the creative director of my many and varied hairstyles . Hot combs pressed my natural , incredibly thick , full hair straight until I received my first relaxer no thanks to a cousin . Shirley Temple curls , beaded braids , ponytails , twist sets , roller sets , and doobie wraps mark my evolution from childhood through college . As a first-generation , full-time independent student working three jobs , I learned to do my own hair . My Johnny Bravo was a particular favorite . Like other students , I also depended upon kitchen beauticians ( unlicensed cosmetologists ) to manipulate my hair when I was n t able to due to lack of funds and a tight schedule . Even that was a luxury of sorts . Still , in all of these places , I felt at home . My hair was never unprofessional , it was just a part of me an ever-changing extension of myself . After graduating from the University of South Carolina Upstate and Navy Officer Candidate School , I reported to my first command and all that changed . Suddenly , I was put under the microscope , and so was my hair . It was too puffy or not slick enough my eventual bun became too thick . My ever-changing hairstyles were now perceived as indecisiveness on my part . Why do you always change your hair ? was a constant refrain . A teaching moment ? Perhaps . A point of contention ? Absolutely . I began to question myself deeply before realizing a few things . I was created in the Imago Dei exactly how God intended for me to be curls and all . The black community has a different relationship with hair than others , and that s fine . It s great , actually . Regular hair appointments and style changes are a facet of black culture . Perception is reality , though , and regardless of how I felt , I still had a Navy standard to maintain , at all costs . Since then , I have seen and worn every authorized style possible . No expense has been spared . Time , money , and mileage become expendable when mandatory salon visits help meet the objective and obtain the illusive distinction as professional . While the new regulations are n t perfect ( still no faux locs ! ) , they do provide an expanded vision of what professional can look like , including hair that looks like mine . Truthfully , this has removed an unnecessary stressor from my life and opened up a world of possibilities . Who knows , I may eventually start locs of my own or opt to wear a wig . I may go back to styles I m familiar with . Whatever I choose to do , the options have expanded , and while not perfect , the tension between my hair and Navy regulations has eased .

		"paragraph": "BMW AG is the latest company to urge the U.S. not to impose tariffs on auto imports , joining General Motors Co. in pressing its case to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , even as a top aide to President Donald Trump dismissed the concerns as smoke and mirrors . It seems that the threat to impose these sanctions is designed to achieve certain goals , the newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported , citing a copy of BMW s letter to Ross . The Munich-based luxury automaker said its investment of almost $ 9 billion in the Spartanburg , South Carolina , BMW plant , supports more than 120,000 U.S. jobs . White House trade adviser Peter Navarro earlier addressed Friday s stern warning by GM to the Trump administration on Friday , that it could shrink U.S. operations and cut jobs if tariffs are broadly applied to imported vehicles and auto parts . More from Bloomberg.com : Trump Does Deep Dive on High Court Finalists Before July 9 Pick Increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller GM , a reduced presence at home and risk less -- not more -- U.S. jobs , the nation s largest automaker said in comments submitted Friday to the Commerce Department , which Ross leads . That such a blunt statement came from GM -- a company run by a CEO , Mary Barra , whose normal tack is to avoid the political fray and let trade groups address the president s policies -- was surprising to industry observers . And it underscored how high she , and many industrial leaders , believe the stakes are as the president sinks the U.S. into tit-for-tat trade squabbles across the globe . GM s public pronouncement follows similar moves by Harley-Davidson Inc. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Daimler AG . More from Bloomberg.com : Bitcoin Bloodbath Nears Dot-Com Levels as Many Tokens Go to Zero The comment suggests how severe the impact would be to GM , its employees and consumers , said Michelle Krebs , analyst with AutoTrader.com . There is a lot at stake for GM , the auto industry and the overall economy . Navarro shot back at GM on Saturday in an interview on CNN , saying the auto company was using smoke and mirrors to deceive the public . He said the impact of tariffs on the price of a GM car was equivalent to a luxury floor mat . More from Bloomberg.com : U.S. Backs Off Trump Tweet on Saudis Helping Lower Oil Price Even the GM cars built here , about half the content is foreign , Navarro said , adding that U.S. factories had become assembly plants stitching together components made elsewhere . In the case of BMW s massive South Carolina operation , that would be about 1,900 vehicles each day , many of which are exported . Navarro added that Trump , having passed a tax cut that helps companies like GM and Harley , felt betrayed when they then threatened to move production jobs outside the U.S. in response to the retaliatory actions of foreign countries to Trump s tariffs . That echoed a tweet from Trump on Wednesday directed at Harley-Davidson : I ve done so much for you , and then this . Trump ordered an investigation of whether auto imports pose national security risks last month under a section of the same 1960s trade law used to impose levies on steel and aluminum . The administration is said to be considering auto tariffs of as much as 25 percent . Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon that he expected the Commerce Department to complete the investigation in three or four weeks . Under the trade statute , Ross has until February to conclude the inquiry . But people familiar with the matter said Trump wants the investigation to be finished before the midterm elections in November so he can use the tariffs to his political advantage . The probe has raised alarm among manufacturers , parts suppliers and auto retailers because all major carmakers -- including GM and Ford Motor Co. -- import a substantial share of the vehicles they sell in the U.S. from other countries . Levies on parts also would have major implications for top models like the Ford F-150 pickup and Toyota Camry sedan by boosting prices by thousands of dollars . Read more : Toyota Camry faces $ 1,800 cost increase GM fell 2.8 percent -- to $ 39.40 -- in New York , and has now posted three straight weekly declines , the longest such streak since March . GM s message came as a surprise because the company has kept close contact with the Trump administration , James Albertine , analyst with Consumer s Edge Research told Bloomberg TV . So this came as a little bit of a shock to us , he said , as we thought they were working more along the lines of making sure the administration knows the severity of the impact tariffs would have . Barra had earlier tried to stay on good terms with Trump . She continued to serve on his Strategic and Policy Forum even after many other CEOs , such as Walt Disney s Bob Iger and Tesla s Elon Musk , quit to protest Trump s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement last year . The forum was disbanded in August following Trump s tepid response to attacks by white supremacists in Charlottesville , Virginia . Now , the Detroit-based maker of Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC vehicles is warning that additional tariffs -- on top of those recently slapped on steel , aluminum and Chinese products -- could hurt GM and ultimately its customers . Higher prices would crimp sales , particularly to less-affluent consumers , and reduce the number of factory workers needed , it said . If GM were to try to absorb the additional costs , it would have less money to invest in popular vehicles that sustain manufacturing jobs , or toward pivotal technologies including electric and self-driving cars . The threat of steep tariffs on vehicle and auto component imports risks undermining GM s competitiveness against foreign auto producers by erecting broad brush trade barriers that increase our global costs , remove a key means of competing with manufacturers in lower-wage countries , and promote a trade environment in which we could be retaliated against in other markets , the company said . GM s Chevrolet Silverado pickup was the top-selling model imported from Mexico last year , while the Chevrolet Equinox crossover was the leading vehicle sourced from Canada , according to LMC Automotive . Just last week , GM announced plans to bring back the Chevy Blazer SUV later this year . The iconic American brand will be built at a plant in Mexico , a move that sparked angry comments from the United Auto Workers union . In its response , the UAW said that GM sells 80 percent of its Mexican-made vehicles in the U.S. GM imports a lot of pickup trucks from Mexico , so it s a huge issue , Alan Baum , an auto analyst in West Bloomfield , Michigan , said . And for parts , it s not just GM . Everyone imports a lot of electronics from Asia . Those are are high-value parts .

		"paragraph": "I ll never understand how The Last Jedi became the most polarizing movie in the Star Wars franchise , because this is a movie with something for everybody . If you re looking for something new : Hey , it s Kelly Marie Tran and Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro ! If you re wrapped up in Star Wars nostalgia : Hey , it s Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher and Yoda ! ( He s even a puppet again ! ) If you re looking for pure blockbuster spectacle : Hey , it s the best lightsaber battle in the history of the Star Wars franchise ! If you re looking for adorable new creatures you d like to cuddle and/or eat : Hey , it s Porgs ! Among other qualities , The Last Jedi is so packed with things to admire that it s easily the most rewatchable Star Wars movie even more so than The Empire Strikes Back , which is still , pound-for-pound , the best movie in the franchise . And now that The Last Jedi is on Netflix , you can revisit it anytime you want . This is normally the part where I d summarize the movie s plot , but come on , it s Star Wars . You know the basics . The Last Jedi picks up where 2015 s The Force Awakens left off , with Rey hunting down the reclusive Jedi Master Luke Skywalker in an effort to swing the power balance of a war between the evil First Order and the heroic Resistance . That means , in essence , that The Last Jedi is the story of the face of Star Wars past coming to terms with the face of its future . Particularly after the solid-but-predictable Solo : A Star Wars Story , The Last Jedi s narrative boldness is remarkable . It s interesting because this is a movie about Star Wars confronting its own legacy in real time . When Kylo Ren talks about killing the past , he s also talking about a future for Star Wars that for the first time is n t beholden to the legacy of the Skywalker family . At a time when many Hollywood franchises are content to deliver exactly what audiences expect , The Last Jedi s swerves are genuinely daring . Those swerves have also led yes to a vocal and sustained backlash from a subset of Star Wars fans who do n t like them . Before you come yell at me on Twitter , Last Jedi haters , I ll be the first to acknowledge that the movie has some glaring flaws . Even if Episode IX would have explored Leia s proficiency in the Force in more detail , her \" death \" and resurrection in the vacuum of space is a misfire . The Canto Bight sequence is a little long . General Phasma s underwhelming death is a mistake , and the biggest squandering of a promising Star Wars baddie since Darth Maul died at the end of Episode I. ( Of course , Darth Maul came back again , so who knows ? ) But man , I can live with those missteps when they come alongside so many massive leaps forward for the Star Wars franchise . I ve written before about how The Last Jedi uses the audience s knowledge of The Empire Strikes Back like a weapon , setting up one kind of ending before pivoting sharply in a bold new direction for the franchise . If this is the future of Star Wars , sign me up for more .",

		"paragraph": "One of the most buzzed-about primary election victories from Tuesday has been that of Ayanna Pressley , 44 , a Boston City Council member who soundly defeated 10-term Democratic Rep. Mike Capuano in Massachusetts Seventh Congressional District . The position is uncontested , and she is now set to become the first African-American woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress . Change ca n t wait , was the campaign slogan of this Boston mover and shaker who declared at her victory celebration : It s not enough for Democrats to be back in power . It matters who those Democrats are . So who is Pressley ? She s a Chicago native who has struggled with tough personal issues . Though Pressley attended one of Chicago s best private schools , Francis W. Parker School , she had struggles at home namely , the absence of her father , Martin Terrell , who struggled with drug addiction and was incarcerated during most of Pressley s youth ( though he is now a retired director for the United Negro College Fund ) . I am probably an outsider because I challenge conventional narratives about who should have a seat at the table , she told the New York Times of her background . Ayanna s mother , Sandra , was a social worker , community organizer , and legal secretary who died in 2011 . She was a prescient leader , even as a teen . In high school , Pressley was a member of student government as well as a cheerleader . Her senior yearbook quotes included the proverb Blessed is the woman who finds wisdom , the woman who gains understanding , for she is more profitable than silver and gold and the original If nothing else , I am a survivor . She took on Boston with a bang . Years after moving from the Midwest to attend Boston University , Pressley made history as the first black woman elected to the city council . Today , six of the city s 13 council members are women of color . Some local accomplishments include : increasing the number of liquor licenses to benefit restaurants in economically disenfranchised neighborhoods developing a competent , comprehensive sex-ed and health curriculum for the public school system and partnering with the National Black Women s Justice Institute founder to create focus groups and attempt to fix policies that send black and Latina girls on a school-to-prison pipeline . She s no political neophyte . By age 10 , she had volunteered on her first political campaign for Harold Washington , who became Chicago s first black mayor in 1983 . As an adult , Pressley worked for Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II and former Sen. John Kerry , including as the Massachusetts constituency director for Kerry s 2004 presidential campaign . She spoke out about sexual harassment way before the #MeToo movement began . Since 2011 , Pressley has been open about being sexually abused as a child and raped in college . Her experiences have led her to become an advocate for girls and women volunteering at a range of nonprofits , serving as a mentor and Big Sister , and putting her efforts behind events such as the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center s annual Walk for Change . I have dedicated my life to combating trauma in all forms domestic , sexual , gun violence and so the opportunity to potentially be in Congress at a moment of elevated consciousness to codify activism in policy change is certainly an exciting prospect , Pressley told the Nation . She s been widely recognized as a winner for years . Pressley was listed in the Ebony Magazine Power 100 , which celebrates heroes in the black community . She was also named as one of the New York Times s 14 Young Democrats to Watch in 2016 , and in 2015 , Emily s List gave her its annual Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award . Boston Magazine has named her one of the city s 50 Most Powerful People , and the Victim Rights Law Center presented her with its leadership award in 2014 . Though her positions on various issues did n t differ wildly from those of defeated challenger Capuano , she made sure that one of them did . I would not invest in a Trump hate wall , she told WBUR in Boston , in contrast to Capuano , who stated that he d support it in exchange for real immigration reform . We do n t need to be protected from immigrants that are coming here seeking asylum and refuge . I have worked on some very polarizing third-rail issues , she said , adding , I am unwilling to be a moderate when it comes to immigrants rights , workers rights , women s rights , and that of the LGBTQ community . The moment she won Tuesday s primary became a viral moment on Twitter , and it speaks volumes about her character : Her stance on civil rights inspired this supporter s beautiful Twitter thread , which Pressley called out : She has a cat named Sojourner Truth â€¦ and a husband , Conan Harris , as well as a 9-year-old stepdaughter , Cora , whose close-up photo ( above ) of her proud , tear-stained face from Tuesday s victory was one of the most poignant images of the election .

In fact , it seems that Grande may have even gotten a tattoo tribute to her fianc s late father ! While out and about in NYC earlier this week , the songstress was snapped with wearing a pair of high-heeled pumps that showed off four very faint numbers near the top of her foot . As fans were quick to note , the sequence of those numbers 8418 was not inconsequential , as 8418 marks the badge number Davidson s father , a New York city firefighter who died in the 9/11 terror attacks , wore on his uniform . The SNL comedian has a matching tattoo on the inside of his left forearm . Should Grande s perceived ink turn out to be the real deal , it would mark the fourth tattoo the couple has gotten for one another : Davidson debuted a small bunny mask behind his ear and an AG on his thumb in early June , and the twosome showed off some matching cryptic letters later that month .

According to the Daily Beast , an off-duty border patrol agent accidentally started a 47,000 acre wildfire during a gender reveal party hosted by him and his wife . The Arizona Daily Star reports that Dennis Dickey received a $ 220,000 fine and pleaded guilty to the charge of \" causing a fire without a permit \" in the April 2017 Sawmill Fire in Arizona .

How thrifty . Clearly McDormand , 60 , had no superstition about wearing her husband s ex-wife s ring , and the decision did n t bring them any type of bad luck . They met when McDormand was 24 and auditioned for Coen and his brother Ethan s first feature film , 1984 s Blood Simple . She landed the part despite telling Joel that she could n t make it to a callback because her then-boyfriend was appearing on a soap opera and she had to watch it , but that s another story which ended up being her movie debut . They moved in together almost immediately but waited 10 years to marry . The year after their wedding , 1995 , they adopted their son , Pedro McDormand Coen , from Paraguay . It was a revelation that I could have a lover who I could also work with and I was n t intimidated by the person , McDormand told the New York Times Magazine about their relationship . It was : Wow ! Really ! Oh , my God ! I can actually love and live not subvert anything , not apologize for anything , not hide anything . As for Coen s first wife , there s not much out there about her , including her name . The book The Coen Brothers : Interviews ( 2006 ) described the marriage as brief and said that it ended in 1979 , several years before he met McDormand . ( The book noted that the woman concerned wishes to retain her privacy . ) The relationship brought Coen to Texas , he noted in an article in Texas Monthly . I came to Austin in 1979 because I was married to a woman in the graduate program in linguistics at the University of Texas , he wrote . Meanwhile , Kelley L. Ross , PhD , who ran for Congress in 2006 , wrote on his website about attending UT at the same time as Coen . He said he was friends with the couple , referring to the woman by the alias Nan , and even gave them his old bed . However , he wrote , I was away for the summer , and when I got back â€¦ I called up their house . Nan was away , but Joel was there . â€¦ I did n t realize until Nan returned to Austin herself that she and Joel had already broken up . Nan was even already involved with her future next husband , whom she had met in the linguistics department . Given that brief and unremarkable history , we re surprised that McDormand chose to adopt the ring and wear it for more than two decades . It does n t seem as if there was much sentimental value to it and both she and Coen ( she refers to them in the article as the McCoens ) had quite a few paychecks under their belts by the time they were married , so she could have gotten a new ring with no history . But it s not really that out there . It may seem unusual to some , but I think that if he had possession of his first wife s ring , and Frances loved the design of it , why not wear it ? Anne Chertoff , who s the wedding trends expert and editor at WeddingWire , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Now more than ever , there s no must-follow rules with getting married , except that you need a license to make it legal . She continues , A wedding ring is a symbol of a couple s love and commitment to each other and can truly be anything from a classic gold band to a diamond ring to matching tattoos , which some celebs have been known to do . So anything goes . In this case , anything did go and the ring from Coen s first marriage stayed on McDormand s hand for more than 20 years . The actress who seems to have worn it on her middle finger , judging from photos ( perhaps it was too big ? ) does n t tell the Times Magazine why she stopped wearing it , just noting it was something that happened recently . And that too feeds into the mysteriousness and quirkiness about her .

		"paragraph": "This week , Big Brother is all about musclebound Mark s morose mood , his tiny-eyed tears , his heaving pectorals , and wracked sobs . The young man who used to simmer serenely while Josh ran around the house slamming pots and pans together and bellowing Meatball ! has receded , and now Mark sits on the edge of his bed reading a Bible which , from the camera angle , always seems bookmarked at the Book of Revelations , which is a bit too on-the-nose , Mark . Then he drags himself into the Diary Room to moan to us about how he s alone in the house , how he s lost his allies , and how he s doomed to be evicted on Thursday night . And indeed , Mark s eviction does seem inevitable , because who can summon up interest in Matt long enough to vote the bland Mr. Salt and Pepper out ? With the relative lack of suspense this week , it s time to ponder other things , such as : When on God s green astroturf did Christmas and Josh become soulmates ? On last Sunday s BB , we were treated to a lengthy segment in which the hobbled Christmas and arrested-adolescent Josh had long , earnest chats about their philosophies of life and how supportive one has always been of the other . Really ? If so , poor editing , Big Brother . I was away on a vacation for a little while and missed a few episodes , but I never saw this eccentric alliance forming . Thank goodness for Zingbot a sentence I never thought I d be writing when I was studying for a degree in English all those years ago . The ear-splitting ripoff of Robbie the Robot arrived just in time to level insults at every houseguest . His zingers included an especially hurtful parody of The 12 Days of Christmas with lyrics about Christmas s painful foot injury , and a hot dog joke directed at Alex that was so dirty it had to be bleeped . Bonus points to Kevin for giving Zingbot the finger , with both hands . Or at least , I think Kevin was giving him the finger his hands were pixilated , so maybe he was just retelling Zingbot s Alex joke in sign language . The veto competition was a good one : Making houseguests slip and slide to fill up a big fishbowl with green goop led to a lot of sweaty pratfalls , face-plants , and wipeouts . ( If Christmas had been permitted to participate , her uninjured three limbs would have been in casts as well . ) It was also one of the few competitions in which Mark s burly strength actually worked against him his gym-generated bulk seemed to leave him off-balance . I wonder if I m writing Mark off too soon , though . It s possible that , in the final moments before tonight s live eviction , he or Paul will somehow convince his colleagues he s more valuable to have around than Matt , who is a nonentity in the house . The producers may even manipulate the vote somehow , because I m sure they do n t want to lose anyone Josh loves to torment clanging frying pans and bellows of Meatball ! are what define this season of Big Brother .

Well now , chocolate lovers can rest easy : a new study has claimed eating three bars of the stuff per month can actually reduce heart failure . The study presented at the European Society of Cardiology assessed more than half a million adults to look at how consumption of chocolate impacts cardiovascular health . After various forms of testing , they concluded that eating up to three chocolate bars per month can reduce the risk of heart failure by 23 % . This was compared to people who did n t eat any chocolate . However , they also found that eating a lot of chocolate can raise risk of heart failure by 17 % . Dr Chayakrit Krittanawong , lead researcher of the study , advised that , moderate dark chocolate consumption is good for health , according to the Telegraph . This is because milk chocolate contains higher levels of saturated fats . This study supports a study from last year which claims that one piece of chocolate a day can be good for the heart . And it is n t the first time the health benefits of chocolate have been touted in scientific research .

		"paragraph": "With her long bangs and longer face , Jessica Biel is a worried woman in The Sinner , an eight-part series premiering on the USA network on Wednesday . She has plenty to be morose about : In the opening moments of this production , she kills a man on a beach . I ll set the scene : Her character , Cora , is having a nice day of sun and sand with her husband and child , then she gets up off their blanket , walks over and slashes a guy to death . What ? Where did that come from ? Where that came from is the story of The Sinner , which is based on a German bestselling novel , adapted to small-town America by writer Derek Simonds ( When We Rise ) , and produced by Biel herself . Immediately arrested for her shocking crime , Cora pleads guilty , but the judge still wants a trial , especially after a homicide cop played by Bill Pullman insists there s a lot more to this bloody scene than meets the eye . Having seen the first three episodes , I can say that The Sinner is at once intriguing and frustrating . Certainly you want to know why Cora has behaved the way she has . Much of the time , the structure of the show places you in the shoes of Pullman s Detective Harry Ambrose , who s searching for clues to Cora s motivations . Those shoes are a tad uncomfortable for some of us , however , since ol â€˜ Harry has a kinky sex habit that pops up at all sorts of inconvenient times . Pullman , to his credit , plays this character with admirable straightforwardness , with just the hint of an impish smile now and then . A chunk of the opening hours of The Sinner occurs in flashback , as we learn of Cora s upbringing by a religious-zealot mother and some sort of childhood trauma that , three episodes in , has not yet been made clear . Recovered memories are involved . When Cora experiences something stressful , she tends to zone out and picture in her mind the pattern of some old-fashioned wallpaper which naturally reminded me of The Yellow Wallpaper , Charlotte Perkins Gilman s late 19th century novella about a woman s domestic travails and psychosis as manifested by her obsession with a wallpaper pattern . I m hoping The Sinner becomes just as fascinatingly claustrophobic as that book . Biel has n t been on TV much since she starred in the long-running WB series 7th Heaven , but if she was hoping her new role would erase memories of Mary Camden , she s mistaken . Mary , you ll recall , was a convincingly moody teenager , frequently downcast and sullen , obsessed with basketball and the occasional rebellious act ( who can forget the time she vandalized the school gym ? ) . It would not surprise me at all if Mary had grown up to be Cora hard-bitten and intense . As far as her performance goes , Biel goes full Farrah Fawcett in The-Burning-Bed : She is convincingly bedraggled , pulled to emotional extremes . It s a role that is frequently not particularly sympathetic , which is why an actor as innately charming as Biel might have been drawn to it it demonstrates range , in the simplest terms . Whether viewers tuning in hoping for a more glam Biel will become engrossed and stick around for Cora s possible redemption is The Sinner s artistic and commercial gamble . The Sinner airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on USA .

The gown is from de la Renta s Pre-Fall 2018 collection , and is described as a white tulle gown with black bonded looped ribbon tweed laser cut birds . ( It s giving you subtle Alfred Hitchcock vibes , right ? ) According to royal fashion-watchers , the bird design on the dress was actually created by Sarah Esmoingt , a French embellishment designer who works for de la Renta , Zac Posen , and other designers . She wore her hair loose and to one side and her makeup minimal , and paired the gown with black Aquazurra Deneuve pumps and a Birks Bee Stackable Ring .

		"paragraph": "After eight years of marriage , Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett have announced their separation . On Friday , the former Girls Next Door star confirmed the news in an emotional Instagram post . I will forever love Hank and be open but for now we have chosen to go our own ways , Wilkinson , 32 , shared . I m beyond sad and heartbroken because i did believe in forever , that s why i said yes but unfortunately too much fear has gotten in the way . The reality star went on to say there s no hate and that she and Baskett will continue to spend time together with their two children : son Hank Baskett IV , 8 , and daughter Alijah Mary Baskett , 3 . According to TMZ , Wilkinson filed legal documents for a divorce Friday afternoon . She reportedly listed January 1 , 2018 as the date of separation and cited the reason as irreconcilable differences . It s been a bumpy journey for the pair over their decade-long relationship . Take a look back at their ups and downs . The pair had a whirlwind romance after meeting in March 2008 . Wilkinson was ready to move on from being Hugh Hefner s girlfriend and a member of E! s Girls Next Door â€¦ even though she wanted to start the next chapter of her life at the Playboy Mansion . That s where the couple tied the knot in the summer of 2009 . Months later they endured their first obstacle as Baskett , then a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles , was released . However , he quickly found a home in Indianapolis , signing with the Colts . Personally , things seemed to be going great , as the couple welcomed their first child together , son Hank IV , in December . Baskett s NFL career took a tumble â€¦ or rather , fumble . He had a costly mistake in the 2010 Super Bowl , fumbling an onside kick that helped lead the Saints to victory over the Colts . Wilkinson was visibly upset following the game , leaving the stadium in tears . Baskett was released by Indianapolis , but the Eagles picked him up for the 2010-11 season , only to cut him ( again ) after two games . He was picked up by the Minnesota Vikings , but Wilkinson did not move there with him . It s actually a blessing in disguise , she explained on the Today show , clarifying they were n t separated . We get a chance to know each other all over again and communicate . Ultimately , Baskett s football career ended in Minnesota when his option was n t picked up at the end of the season . The couple was also hit with a personal scandal . Wilkinson s sex tape with a former high school boyfriend was released , which she called the hardest time of our lives . It broke my heart because how can you do that when I have a baby ? she said on her solo E! show , Kendra . I have a kid . I have a husband . It just sucks . She added , It s hard on [ Hank ] because it involves another guy , of course , and it s hard on him because of our son and everything . â€¦ He s like , â€˜ Kendra , we just have to hold our heads high because , yeah , we re going to get attacked , but we ca n t run . We have to hold hands and walk through this and face this fact . It s going to be really hard . It s going to probably be the hardest time of our lives . Unfortunately , that was n t the case , as a harder time was around the corner . In an interview with In Touch , Wilkinson revealed she suffered with postpartum depression after giving birth , which she believed was partly triggered by their move to Indiana . I felt devastated , helpless like I was in a black hole , she said . I even thought of harming myself . I just threatened [ suicide ] a lot . She also admitted it led to marital problems . Hank deserved better than me , she believed , adding , Hank and I slept in separate bedrooms . There were times when I knew I was about to snap . I d be like , â€˜ Hank , go ! Go away ! I did n t feel right . Hank would take the baby and leave the room , she recalled , fearing their marriage was over . I was just mean , she exclaimed , saying she would blame Baskett for their unstable home life , threatening to leave him with Baby Hank if he did n t find a steady job . In May , Wilkinson gave birth to their second child , daughter Alijah . However , their baby bliss did n t last for long . Shortly after welcoming their little girl , the pair s marriage was rocked by reports that Baskett had an affair with a transgender model while Wilkinson was eight months pregnant . After discovering the headlines to be true , Wilkinson threw their wedding photos in the pool and flushed her wedding ring down the toilet . On an episode of her show Kendra on Top , she even admitted to suicidal thoughts . I was at a real low , she told the camera . I even questioned my life . If it was n t for breastfeeding Alijah , the bond I had with her , I feel like I would have probably ended my life . I felt like I m not even supposed to be here . Wilkinson took her husband back in an attempt to save their marriage . A year after the allegation , Baskett acknowledged the incident , saying he made a mistake . I messed up , a teary-eyed Baskett told People in 2015 . And everything through me brought pain upon this family . Baskett claimed he was fondled through his basketball shorts against his will by the woman after putting himself in a bad situation , but that he did n t participate in a sexual act . I was this big former football player , he told the magazine . I was the alpha male . I could do anything to protect my family , but I could n t protect myself . Wilkinson added , Hank was very naive and gullible . He thinks everybody is his friend . That led him to the hell that we ve lived . â€¦ I do n t say the word â€˜ cheat . I can say he was not loyal to me . I do n t care about the act . I care about how he reacted to it and how I was told by the media what happened . That scarred me . In the same sit-down , Baskett told People he was depressed after his NFL career ended . The stress and depression was eating away at me , he exclaimed , saying one of his lowest points came near the end of 2013 . I fell into what happens to a lot of professional athletes who change careers . It hit me , and it hit hard . â€¦ My biggest insecurity was looking like a failure . I made it to the NFL , I was a smart kid , I was the A student . I was pregnant during his most depressing time in his life , Wilkinson added . Anytime he said , â€˜ Kendra , I m not feeling too good , I would say , â€˜ Shut up , I m pregnant ! I never gave him the opportunity to come to me with his feelings . â€¦ Before football , he was alive . After , he d walk around in a daze . I d be like , â€˜ This is not the same guy I knew . It was when he was trying to buy weed that Baskett claimed the incident with the transgender model occurred . I put myself in a bad situation , Baskett says , whether I was battling depression or not . The pair documented their relationship struggles on the third season of the reality show Kendra on Top , as well as on Marriage Boot Camp : Reality Stars . All is forgiven ? In March , the pair publicly celebrated the anniversary of when they first met with sweet Instagram posts . ( Wilkinson s has since been deleted . ) 9 years ago I met the person who would take me all the way to the top and hold me there even during the weakest times . We met that day out on the golf course and knew he was mine , she wrote alongside a photo of the two . Even with little bumps in the road , nothing or nobody can be greater or make me feel more successful than [ Hank ] . Imperfection is where great change and growth happens with us . We are true best friends who f *** good , fight good , golf good , BBQ and drink beer good â€¦ Thank you for being there on the golf course that day and being that shy guy . Thank u for my happiness and our children â€¦ here s to eternity . Baskett posted a similar photo which has also been deleted writing , In life you re told to go with your gut . Well , 9 years ago I did just that â€¦ Instead of just a day of golf I found a lifetime of love ! Things happen for a reason and I m eternally grateful they did that day ! I love you bayba !! While they looked like a happy family on social media , Wilkinson revealed things were n t rosy behind closed doors . In February , she took to Instagram to address a tabloid report that claimed they were faking marriage problems for TV . The since-deleted post read : 1 . How do u fake marital problems ? Makes absolutely no sense . 2 . Yes we are having issues . 3 . My job has been reality TV for 13 years 4 . My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama . Not what I wanted but was a part of my journey and story . 5 . These issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are trying to hard to over come , everyone knows about , including producers and network , friends and family . 6 . My job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing I want to do is hurt Hank 7 . I hope to get back to the fun Kendra you all know . That s all I want n aim for . I hate drama ! Things did n t turn around in March when Wilkinson shared emotional Instagram Stories about her fragile state . Multiple reports soon surfaced that she was preparing to finally pull the plug on their nearly nine-year marriage . They ve been having a really tough time especially over the last three to six months , a source close to the Girls Next Door alum revealed to People . She s always been someone who wanted to be fully committed , married forever , and was definitely an â€˜ I ll never get a divorce kind of girl , but she really lost trust in her marriage and she s realized there s no turning back . On April 6 , Wilkinson confirmed their marriage was over , but that there is no ill will . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

[ Related : The 5 best games of Lamar Jackson s Heisman-winning season ] He also created a compendium of Heisman Moment-type plays : leaping a Syracuse defender on a touchdown run a flowing , spinning , 47-yard touchdown run in a rout of Florida State and a game-winning touchdown pass at Virginia with just 13 seconds remaining in the game . Some even considered an incomplete pass at Clemson , after somehow eluding multiple rushers , a Heisman-worthy play . Not even a season-ending two-game losing streak could significantly loosen Jackson s hold on the Heisman . The Cardinals were upset by Houston and Kentucky and Jackson committed four turnovers against the Wildcats , but the lack of consensus on an alternative candidate kept Jackson in command . Thirteenth-ranked Louisville is 9-3 heading into the Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl against LSU on Dec. 31 . Against the Tigers , Jackson will have a chance to go after another statistical milestone : he is two touchdowns away from the FBS single-season Top 10 . Jackson is just the fourth sophomore to win the award , following Florida quarterback Tim Tebow , Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford and Alabama running back Mark Ingram . As a true sophomore , he is not yet eligible for the NFL draft and will have a chance to come back and attempt back-to-back Heisman-winning seasons . However , that s far easier said than done Ohio State s Archie Griffin remains the only player to accomplish the feat , in 1974 and 75 .",

Now , Zuckerberg 's about to get his title stolen-by a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan . Kylie Jenner , according to a glowing Forbes profile from a package about rich self-made women , is currently worth $ 900 million . She is 20 years old . Give it a year , and her worth will hit the billion-dollar mark , just as she will hit the legal drinking age . That will make her the youngest self-made billionaire , male or female , unseating Zuckerberg 's record from 2008 . What 'd you accomplish today ?

		"paragraph": "Most scientists do n t agree with the notion that marijuana is a gateway drug , but it may turn out to be in at least one respect . Activists are campaigning in California and Colorado states where marijuana is legal to decriminalize psilocybin , the drug compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms . Their hope is that legalization will pave the way for its medicinal use . Since 1971 , magic mushrooms have been classified as a Schedule I drug , defined as a substance that has a high potential for abuse and is not currently accepted for medicinal use . However , an increasing body of scientific evidence says that psilocybin may indeed be worth exploring for its medicinal properties . If psilocybin were an approved medication , it would likely be prescribed for mood disorders such as depression , or depression related to a life-threatening illness , Albert Garcia-Romeu , a research associate at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Other promising areas include use of psilocybin as an aid for anxiety-related conditions , and addictions , many of which can be difficult to manage effectively , even with the best available treatments . Garcia-Romeu is one of the authors of a small study that tested the use of psilocybin , along with cognitive behavioral therapy , to help people stop smoking . After just three treatments with the drug , 60 percent of participants were still abstaining from smoking more than two years later . That s a much higher success rate than the average 35 percent achieved by other smoking cessation methods , he says . Other studies have shown that psilocybin in conjunction with psychological treatment can help with depression and has improved both anxiety and depression in patients diagnosed with life-threatening cancer . There are legal medications for depression , anxiety , and for some addictions . However , these do not always work , and often come with unwanted side effects for those who do use them , Garcia-Romeu says . It s also important to note that a major difference between psilocybin-assisted treatment and other medications is that psilocybin is usually only administered [ one to three ] times as part of a brief treatment and exhibits rapid-acting effects that can last months or longer . Antidepressant medications , for example , often need to be used daily over extended periods of time ( months or longer ) for sustained effects and may not work fast enough to help in extreme cases of depression . Researchers are still trying to figure out exactly how psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs help with these psychiatric conditions , but it might actually be because of the subjective experiences that people have while tripping . It s still unknown if therapeutic effects may occur independently of the psychoactive effects of psilocybin , Garcia-Romeu tells Yahoo . However , one finding that has consistently emerged across various trials is that psilocybin can occasion profoundly meaningful experiences associated with persisting changes in people s worldview and perceptions of themselves . These kinds of experiences may help reduce severity of depression and anxiety , as well as increase the likelihood of behavior change for people overcoming addictions . These psychological effects have also been linked to changes in brain function during and after drug administration , which is helping us better understand the biology of these drugs and disorders through continuing research . One theory is that psychedelics increase brain connectivity . Issues like depression and anxiety are associated with inflexible brain patterns , and an experience with one of these drugs may allow patients to make new ones . A problem with all of the studies conducted on psilocybin is that they have very small sample sizes , and it s difficult to test the drug against a placebo . If the government were to relax laws restricting the drug s use , researchers would have more funds and freedom to expand their work , Garcia-Romeu says . None of this is to say there s no danger to using these drugs . People can have intense anxiety and sometimes panic reactions under the influence of psilocybin , which have colloquially been referred to as a â€˜ bad trip , he explains . These types of experiences can lead to persisting negative effects like psychotic reactions or mood or perceptual problems . Furthermore , in an uncontrolled setting , in people who are unprepared for psilocybin s effects or vulnerable populations , these types of experiences can sometimes lead to unpredictable or dangerous behavior . Participants in the studies are prescreened for mental conditions that might make them more prone to such reactions , and trained staff remain with them just in case . Even as Garcia-Romeu sees the potential of psilocybin as a medication , he is not necessarily advocating for its broader use recreationally . Drugs with medicinal value can be , and often are , abused recreationally with very bad outcomes , he says . Opioids are a good example . There are risks to taking psilocybin that can be exacerbated by recreational use in uncontrolled settings and by vulnerable populations and other individuals who might not be well prepared for the drug s powerful effects .

		"paragraph": "Kyrie Irving s introductory press conference began with a tribute to the two Boston Celtics he just traded places with and ended with an appreciation of Cleveland Cavaliers teammate LeBron James . Throughout Friday s half-hour meeting with the media , Irving and the Celtics brass took the high road amid a barrage of questions about the six-week soap opera that led him from Cleveland to Boston . The first query posed to the four-time All-Star point guard : Kyrie , you ve said that you want to be in a place where you can maximize your potential . Why do you feel like Boston can be that place for you ? Before we get to that , Irving began , I just wanted to say that sometimes we get lost in these two hoops and basketball . We lose track of the most humane things that make us human sometimes , and I want to take a timeout to send my heartfelt well energy to Jae Crowder and his mother , because that s a hard situation to go through , especially when it gets up in all of this , as well as [ Isaiah Thomas ] sister , and as well as all those affected in Charlottesville and those affected in Houston . That is all reality-based , and I live in that world , he added . Basketball , me perfecting my craft , is very important to me , but outside of this game I very much live a real life , and I appreciate all the people around me as well as all the human beings I end up meeting . I just wanted to say that my appreciation for the world goes deeper than a lot of people realize , and I pay my respects for all those people as well as anyone affected by anything . We re all here with you , and my prayers are with you . [ Follow Ball Do n t Lie on social media : Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ] Thomas lost his sister Chyna a day before Boston s playoff run last season . Crowder s mother died the day the Celtics agreed to deal him . The two players , along with Ante Zizic , Brooklyn s 2018 first-round pick and a 2020 second-round selection from Miami , were finally traded for Irving on Wednesday . Irving s poignant remarks set the tone for what was a thoughtful 30 minutes in Boston , but the elephant in the room lingered until the morning s final question : What s your relationship with LeBron now ? Have you spoken with him since this whole process began with his asking for the trade ? No . I have n t spoken to him , said Irving , pausing for a moment before crediting James for his growth . I d be lying to you guys if I did n t tell you how much I learned from that guy , he said . The perfection of the craft comes in a variety of forms , and you ask a lot of the great players , â€˜ What does it take to be great ? I ve had the unique opportunity to play with one of the greats , and it was awesome . â€¦ When you look back and you re eternally grateful for the moments you ve had and you ve shared , you re able to put peace with that journey and start anew . This was a very , very challenging decision at first , but after a while , you understand and you have that confidence in yourself to understand the magnitude of what you actually can accomplish and potentially can do with other great people . Now that I m sitting here , it just echoes in terms of me being very appreciative of the Cleveland fans and all of Ohio , as well as Bron incorporating me into that special team that we had , because three Finals in a row , all the shared memories with all the individuals â€¦ the brotherhood exists , even without all of this , and it will continue . That s exactly where it is , and I m very appreciative of it . The idea that Irving has n t talked to James since this Eastern Conference drama began is certainly notable , considering the point guard s trade request come anywhere from seven to 10 weeks ago . But if anyone came to the press conference looking for a sound bite to play before the Celtics and Cavaliers meet in the opening game of the NBA season on Oct. 17 , they were n t going to get one beyond Irving turning to new Boston teammate Gordon Hayward and saying , It s about to be crazy , G. Much of the media session was filled with cliches about the Celtics tradition . Getting an opportunity to be a part of such an illustrious organization as the Boston Celtics , man , I grew up watching so many different films , said Irving , who will wear his father s No. 11 in Boston , and I asked Danny when we were at dinner if I could get a few of his VHS tapes from those championship runs that they had . There was chemistry with Hayward , who was an afterthought at their introduction . The two discussed their days as USA Basketball development teammates and the time Irving tried recruiting Hayward to Cleveland in 2014 free agency . And then LeBron came and that kinda squashed that whole thing , said Hayward , who will wear Ray Allen s No. 20 . There was even a joke about Hayward s days at Butler , when he just missed a shot that would have upset Duke the year before Irving joined the Blue Devils . Irving reportedly requested the trade hoping to escape LeBron s shadow , leading to much speculation about their relationship , but the closest Kyrie came to ribbing his former teammate was in response to a question about what he said on social media on Thursday , There are no other ulterior reasons , other than being happy and wanting to be somewhere where you feel like it s an environment that s conducive for you maximizing your potential as a human being , and as a player perfecting their craft . Even then , Irving only vaguely referenced learning the hard way and a few things for me to go through in Cleveland that led him to believe a change of scenery would benefit his development . It was my time to do what was best for me in terms of my intentions , and that s going after something bigger than myself and honestly being in an environment that s conducive to my potential , Irving elaborated on Friday . I think that statement is self-explanatory , because it s pretty direct in terms of what my intent is : To be happy and to be with a group of individuals that I can grow with . Is Irving saying Cleveland was n t an environment that s conducive to my potential and the Cavaliers are n t a group of individuals I can grow with ? More specifics , please . Except , they never really came . I knew I was n t going to come up here to specifically point at individuals and what the issues were , because that s not important to me at all , Irving said when asked to get more specific . It ll be an unbelievable experience for something new , and to be in a place like this where everyone will gravitate not only to us as individuals , but us as a group and a team , and they ve done it in the years before us and will continue to do it for the years after us , and I just wanted to be a part of that . Ah , the old Celtics tradition cliches . Could n t the Boston media feast on at least one jab at LeBron ? Is there ever such thing as just one person carrying a whole team ? I do n t think so , Irving said in response to a question about getting his chance to be the man . When you have a collection of individuals who all have one mission and one goal and collectively get better every day , there are a lot of moving parts , and you have to depend on those moving parts to do their job at their ultimate ability that only they ll know . It s our job to bring the best out of one another every single day . That s been echoed through this whole entire organization , as well as the players and the tradition that s here in Boston . There is no one player . There are some very , very special talents , but I think the teams get remembered more than the players sometimes , even though you guys do have some Hall of Famers here . There are a few numbers retired in those rafters . The appreciation goes a lot deeper because of that team atmosphere . There is no such thing as putting a team on your shoulders . Are no one player and putting a team on your shoulders a couple shots at the shadow James casts over a team ? Nope . Somehow , Irving still managed to turn a question about his reasoning for leaving LeBron s side into eloquent commentary on the Celtics tradition . He even heaped some praise on the Cavaliers at the end : That s the common knowledge I have of this game that was given to me and the love that I have for it because of being on a special team like that and having special individuals and looking a man in the eye and telling them that , â€˜ You can depend on me . There s nothing like that . Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge refused to comment on Cleveland s decision to reopen negotiations over concerns about Thomas hip injury . Irving again faced head on a question about the dramatic week between the deal being agreed to and finalized , and again came out clean . Throughout this time , I ve been very patient in the approach , said Irving . I knew what the intent was when I asked for the trade initially , and it was just left at that patiently waiting . It was honestly the most human thing I could ve done , which is ride the rollercoaster wave of emotions , but the important thing at the time was coming off the Finals loss and not wallowing in my sorrows , but trying to figure out the next step in order to achieve that goal . In doing that , I just made a very courageous decision in order to take myself and my intent and wanting to be a part of something bigger than myself . And , ooh , when Boston came a knocking , I was answering . It was pretty awesome the way it all transpired , because throughout this time I did n t say anything . Not a word . It was just assumptions and who said , this said , and this camp and this source . I do n t want to dive into that , but I did n t say anything purposely , because that s not the real life I live in . If you re looking at those comments through Cleveland s wine-and-gold lens , you might take issue with Irving calling his trade request a very courageous decision , but considering the ringer he was put through for wanting off a team that featured one of the game s all-time greats and seemed sure to make a fourth straight Finals appearance , you have to admit asking out when he did took some guts . When Irving was done , it was Hayward s turn to take the high road . He was asked whether the departure of Thomas , who helped lure him to Boston in July , changed his feelings about the Celtics . IT did a tremendous job in terms of recruiting me here to the city of Boston , the All-Star forward said . He talked about Boston , the fans , the organization , the coaches , the people who are involved behind the scenes , and he was somebody I was definitely excited about playing with . He s an unbelievable player , had an unbelievable year last year . I d be lying if I said that was n t the truth , but I ve been in this league long enough to realize it is a business . Things happen , things can change . I go from an opportunity to play with IT and the rest of the guys that moved on to now playing with Kyrie Irving , who s one of the best basketball players in the league , and another great opportunity for me . The same goes for the other players as well . Jae Crowder is a tremendous basketball player . Unfortunately , I wo n t get a chance to play with him , but at the same time we get Marcus Morris , Aron Baynes , Marcus Smart , Terry Rozier , two young guys Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown Al Horford . â€¦ So the opportunity is still there for me . Going through it is something I m excited about . I m excited about coming here , moving to Boston , moving my family here , and thrilled to get the season going . Yup , it was a real kumbaya moment for Boston , free from the barbs talking heads may have hoped for . In contrast to the last time a superstar left Cleveland , there were no welcome parties or championship promises . There was just this from the ex-Cavaliers point guard : I m glad to be here . If you want drama between Kyrie and LeBron , you ll just have to wait for it to unfold on the court opening night .

There 's no use in telling the two to slow things down because within a matter of weeks , the couple announced that they were dating , engaged in some over-the-top couple behavior on social media , and then announced that they are engaged to be married . Now , Grande has packed up her life in California and moved into a new apartment with Davidson in New York . The curved apartment building , designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid , is located in Chelsea , and the couple 's unit cost a reported $ 16 million . Given that hefty price tag , it would make sense that the amenities of the apartment are of the luxurious variety . Not only does Grande and Davidson 's 4,000-square-foot interior include five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms , but the apartment complex also reportedly features a large gym and a skylit pool that ranges 75 feet , according to TMZ . The building also has its very own private IMAX theater , so the couple will never have to worry about going out to the movies and running into any fans , and an unobstructed view of the High Line and Empire State Building , which will give them a nice view of Davidson 's office at 30 Rock all the way from across town .

		"paragraph": " Heroes , the NBC smash hit whose success announced in 2006 that nerd culture had truly become mainstream , is coming back . Check out the teaser below to learn â€¦ absolutely nothing . Details are being kept under wraps for the time being , but we know it 's coming back as a 13-episode miniseries , \" Heroes : Reborn , \" sometime next year . We do n't know if creator Tim Kring will be picking up where he left off delivering the promised Volume 6 : Brave New World or rebooting the series completely , as so often happens where comic books are involved . The original series ended with Claire ( the cheerleader of Save the Cheerleader , Save the World fame , played by Hayden Panettiere ) revealing the existence of superpowers to the world by jumping from the top of a Ferris wheel in front of a crowd of reporters . Many of the main characters watched , including her father Noah ( Jack Coleman ) , who 'd spent the entire series keeping that secret from the public . The logical choice , then , would be for Reborn to take place some time after this revelation , perhaps several years in the future so as to differentiate it from the Marvel universe where normal people are also just learning about superheroes after the events in \" The Avengers . \" Sylar ( Zachary Quinto ) ended the series a changed man , finding that being a hero was more fulfilling than being a serial killer . He was being helped down that path by Peter ( Milo Ventimiglia ) . Tracy ( Ali Larter ) was also trying to make amends for past misdeeds hence the final season 's title , Redemption . Though Hiro ( Masi Oka ) wanted to give up \" missions , \" Ando ( James Kyson ) dragged him back in and it 's likely they wo n't be able to ignore the siren 's song of the hero lifesyle for long . Mohinder ( Sendhil Ramamurthy ) and Matt ( Greg Grunberg ) were both missing from the final scene of Claire 's revelation because they were trying to escape their powers and live a normal life ... but that 's hard to do when you have super-strength and telepathy . [ Photos : Check Out More Pics of the Original ' Heroes ' Cast ] The new \" Heroes \" miniseries is only set to run for 13 episodes , which could be for any number of reasons . Maybe it 's the influence and success of the cable model Breaking Bad and Justified use their short seasons to heighten drama . Maybe the network is trying to capture the success of Season 1 of Heroes without suffering the precipitous ratings slide of Seasons 2 through 4 . Another reason might be to accommodate the return of actors who have broken out since the show ended . Someone like Quinto , who now plays Spock in the big-screen \" Star Trek \" franchise , would be unlikely to commit to a multi-season or even a full 22-episode season television contract now . But if he 's only needed for a short production schedule , it 's much more likely to happen . Watch the cast of \" Heroes \" talk about the pilot episode : Similarly , Panettiere is a series regular on ABC 's \" Nashville , \" Oka is on CBS 's \" Hawaii Five-0 , \" Ramamurthy has The CW 's \" Beauty and the Beast , \" and Larter has TNT 's upcoming drama \" Legends \" in between movie shoots . All of them would be difficult to schedule , but given the show 's history of running parallel storylines that rarely require all of the actors to be together at the same time , it 's possible they could all return . Grunberg may have a little more free time since Lifetime canceled The Client List , \" and Coleman was just murdered by his wife on \" Scandal , \" so hopefully he 's available , too . Ventimiglia 's Crackle web series \" Chosen \" was renewed for a third season , but its 13-episode structure would probably make his \" Heroes \" return doable . [ Related : Get a Sneak Peek at Fox 's New ' 24 ' Miniseries ] Of course , since Heroes is known for is having one of the largest regular ensembles in TV history , the show wo n't necessarily be derailed if they ca n't get back some of their stars .

Are you excited for the show 's return , or did your interest fizzle as the seasons went on ? Which characters are you hoping to see ? Would you rather they start from scratch ? \" Heroes : Reborn \" will air in 2015 on NBC .",

		"paragraph": "( Bloomberg ) -- Profit secured . Tesla Inc. blew away expectations with just the third quarter of positive earnings in its history , bolstering Elon Musk s bid to make selling electric cars a financially sustainable business . The profit and cash that Tesla generated sent its shares surging to levels last seen in mid-August , when the chief executive officer was still in the midst of a short-lived gambit to take the company private . The stock sold off in the intervening months , after Musk s claim that he had funding secured for such a deal proved faulty and landed him in legal jeopardy . All the while , Tesla was achieving long-awaited breakthroughs to boost production of Model 3 sedans . Buyers -- many of whom had been waiting more than two years to take delivery -- quickly made it one of the top-selling sedans in the U.S. Tesla is still far from being a full-line automaker , and it s followed up past quarters of profitability with strings of more losses . It s still nowhere close to generating revenue and earnings to contend with the likes of Toyota Motor Corp. or BMW AG . But even investors who ve been among the most vocally bearish about the company have started to change their view as Musk lures away buyers of Camry and 3-Series sedans . It is the most encouraging sign of sustainable profitability that we ve seen in three years , said Gene Munster , a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures . Tesla did all of this despite the distractions around Elon himself , and the positive report reverses some of the damage that s been done . Tesla reported adjusted net income of $ 2.90 a share , soundly beating analysts average estimate for a small loss . Free cash flow was about $ 881 million , a turnabout from the billions of dollars Tesla was burning on a quarterly basis while it was struggling to ramp up the Model 3 . And even as deliveries took off , Tesla managed to maintain more than $ 900 million in customer deposits , showing that there s still plenty of pent-up demand for the company s cars . Musk capped the quarterly report with a drama-free earnings call , which is far from a given for him . He opened by calling on executives responsible for efforts ranging from artificial intelligence and Autopilot to workplace safety , leaving less time than usual for the question-and-answer session with analysts . The quarter marks an inflection point , said Joe Dennison , associate portfolio manager of Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle . Strong demand for pricier all-wheel-drive and high-performance versions of the Model 3 , plus Tesla s plan to start selling the car in Europe early next year , should support profit margins , he wrote in an email.Tesla reaffirmed its forecast for profit and positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter , adding credibility to Musk s prediction a quarter ago that the company will make those feats routine going forward . The CEO couched those comments in August by saying that force majeure events could prove him wrong . One such circumstance the company will have to muddle through in the coming quarters will be trade tensions involving China . Higher tariffs have hit demand for Model S sedans and Model X crossovers imported into the country . Parts that Tesla sources from China and uses to build all of its vehicles in California are also being hit with higher levies , which will be a $ 50 million blow to gross profit in the fourth quarter .

		"paragraph": "This week , it was announced that Jennifer Lopez will receive the MTV Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award . It s a big one : Past recipients include Jackson himself , his sister Janet , Beyonc , and Rihanna . Yet it feels long overdue for Ms. Lopez as Vogue s resident J.Lo fan , I ll say that she should have received it ages ago . I love that she has her own makeup line ( with Inglot ! ) . I loved her defunct label , Sweetface ( RIP ! ) . And hell , I really love the music video for If You Had My Love . ( I even tracked down its stylist ! ) So naturally , I jumped at the opportunity to chat exclusively with Lopez about her monumental award , style evolution , and all things J.Lo . When I meet her on a cushy couch at MTV Studios , she looks fresh-faced like she s just stepped out of 1997 s Anaconda but way more glam . Jenny sparkles . Maybe it is the hint of highlighter ( presumably Inglot ) , but the glint is most likely coming from her diamond hoops . They are the first thing I notice . She has been wearing hoops since she entered the industry in the early 90s as a Fly Girl on In Living Color . She continued to wear them fist-size , simple , and silver in most of her videos . Today s hoops are much smaller more like half-dollars but carat encrusted . The shape is special to Lopez , who grew up in a modest Puerto Rican home in the Bronx , and she considers them a piece of her culture . It was hoops , big accessories , and jewelry . Where most women would be like , â€˜ That s not chic in the fashion world . Like less is more and all that , that is the one place where I express myself and where I am from really comes into play , she says . That urban , hip-hop , Latina upbringing . With adornment and the more jewelry we had , we aspired to that glamour , that Hollywood type of glamour , and we associated that with pretty things and jewelry . That is something that is from that time and is a big part of my style now . Of course , Lopez now has all that glamour and more than she could have ever imagined . When she finally started to make it , she recalls , her first big purchase was a black Dolce & Gabbana dress . She illustrates the cut , cupping her hand and slicing it across mid-calf . ( As she is doing this , my eyes are laser-focused on her hulking diamond rings . ) It was the perfect black pencil-length strappy dress , she says . I just used to go to some store in the mall that carried different labels , and some of them are good and one of them was Dolce & Gabbana . I tried on this black dress for this premiere that I had to go to with someone early in my career , before I was even starring in my own movies . Fun fact : She still has it in her closet . Since then , Lopez has certainly added more luxury to her wardrobe . She is often spotted with her rotating collection of Birkins , carried ever so casually . Just yesterday , she sported a black version with her athleisure ( complete with lime green sneakers ! ) . Sometimes she even uses it as her gym bag . ( A Birkin apr s gym . How J.Lo ! ) I ask just how many she owns , and she gives me a very humble answer or humble for someone who has multiple Birkins , including one in crocodile skin . I have a couple . They are n t something you can buy every day . Usually , they are gifts , she says . People wait for my birthday , and they chip in and they buy me one . I think I have bought one in my life . The rest have been gifts for my birthday or Christmas from really special people . ( Lopez must have some nice friends . ) I imagine her beau , Alex Rodriguez , giving Lopez a Birkin . The two seem to have magnetic chemistry , as if they were made for each other . The high-powered duo even coordinate stylewise at least I think so , until Lopez corrects me . It is funny , we do n t coordinate , but we go together well . It matches kind of , she says . I hate prom looks . â€˜ I m dressed in this and you re dressed in that . We do n t do that . As it happens , she wooed A-Rod with the most J.Lo look ever on their first date : a simple turtleneck ( Lopez loves a turtleneck and wears them often , even on dates ) . He actually reminded me of this the other day . He goes , â€˜ You had on a beige , camel-colored turtleneck and these drawstring kind of slacks up to here , says Lopez , motioning to her waist . â€˜ And drawstring tied , kind of in a business pattern . And some high-heeled boots . Did she wear hoops ? I do n t bother asking . A-Rod aside , there is one big thing on Lopez s mind ( or maybe just mine ) . What is she going to wear to accept the Vanguard at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 20 ? ( She 'll be performing , too , the first time since 2001 . ) She does n t know and tells me that those decisions are typically made last minute . That said , she does note that it will be most likely something Versace . Of course ! She has a long relationship with the house think : J.Lo in that naval-skimming Versace dress from the 2000 Grammy Awards . More recently , she attended the Met Gala with Donatella Versace in 2015 , and only yesterday , she wore Versace denim boots with little belts . She fondly recollects meeting Donatella back in 1999 at Lopez s first Met Gala . Lopez went as the date of Sean Combs , who was performing that night . ( Instead of Diddy , the moniker he goes by now , Lopez endearingly refers to him as Puffy , his name at the time . ) The event fell shortly after Gianni Versace s tragic death , and Lopez was seated next to Donatella at dinner . My heart went out to her [ Donatella ] . I just kept touching her and holding her hand , Lopez says . She felt so fragile at the time . And she remembered that and we kind of bonded after that . She was so kind and so sweet to me , and we always kept in touch . She was always sending me dresses for whatever I needed . It was a natural organic relationship that was n t forced . It is a friendship that goes back many years . Like I said , Lopez has some nice friends . Before I know it , time is up . I had been planning to take a selfie with her since the interview was confirmed the day before ( after all , I love Lopez s selfies ) . I get the green light , and she takes my iPhone and extends a toned arm . Crouched next to her , I tell her that I have n t taken a selfie with anyone I ve interviewed since working at Vogue over the past four years . Most people are boring ! she jokes . That is one thing that J.Lo certainly is not . See this month s best dressed celebrities : Read More Fashion Stories : Watch Kendall Jenner Ask Herself Some Existential Questions :",

After briefly reuniting for the past two months , the Tesla and SpaceX founder , 46 , and Justice League actress , 31 , are calling it quits for the second time , PEOPLE confirms . Elon decided it was time to end it and Amber agreed . They both still care deeply for each other but the timing was n t right , says a source close to the couple . Musk is currently working on the Tesla Model 3 . The duo first broke up because of their increasingly busy schedules in August , but were spotted out together again in January leaving a Los Angeles sushi restaurant hand-in-hand . They re definitely back together , a source close to the couple told PEOPLE at the time . Another source said the former couple spent New Years together as well plus they were seen vacationing together in Chile at the end of December , enjoying dinner with friends who included Musk s brother Kimbal . Heard and Musk also made headlines a few days before Christmas when they were photographed sharing a kiss outside of a Los Angeles restaurant .

		"paragraph": "Asia Argento , one of the first actresses to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault , reportedly paid off a young male actor who accused her of sexual misconduct just months after she came forward about her alleged incident with the disgraced mogul . The actress apparently made a $ 380,000 settlement with child actor Jimmy Bennett , who claims that in 2013 , Argento , then 37 , assaulted him a couple months after he turned 17 , according to The New York Times , which was first to report the news . The incident allegedly occurred in California , where the age of consent is 18 . Bennett , now 22 , played Argento s son in a 2004 movie called The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things . Bennett s accusations , and later the arrangement for restitution , are documented in exchanges between Argento and Bennett s respective lawyers , which the Times notes it received from an encrypted email by an unidentified party . ( The outlet also claims to have sources backing up the details . ) The email allegedly includes a photograph dated May 9 , 2013 , which shows the two lying in bed together . Per their alleged settlement , Bennett had to turn the photograph and its copyright over to Argento . Three people familiar with the case reportedly verified that the documents are real . Reps for both Argento and Bennett did not immediately return EW s request for comment . The Times noted that Argento s representatives did not respond to their requests for comment . Bennett declined an interview with the Times . His lawyer Gordon K. Sattro told the outlet , In the coming days Jimmy will continue doing what he has been doing over the past months and years , focusing on his music . According to the Times , Argento s lawyer Carrie Goldberg wrote an email to the actress in April regarding the details of the deal and payment schedule . In the note , the attorney characterized the money as helping Mr. Bennett . We hope nothing like this ever happens to you again , Goldberg wrote . You are a powerful and inspiring creator , and it is a miserable condition of life that you live among shitty individuals who ve preyed on both your strengths and your weaknesses . The actor s attorneys reportedly notified Argento of their intent to sue in November . According to the Times , the alleged incident affected Bennett s mental health and hurt his acting career . The legal notice was reportedly sent to Anthony Bourdain s lawyer , who was representing Argento at the time . Bourdain and Argento were in a relationship before his death . At the Cannes Film Festival s closing ceremony earlier this year , Argento spoke about Weinstein , saying , In 1997 , I was raped by Harvey Weinstein here at Cannes . I was 21 years old . This festival was his hunting ground . Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 60 women since The New York Times , and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed , Pulitzer-prize winning articles in October . A spokesperson for the producer said in a statement any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein . Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances . Since she came forward with claims against Weinstein , Argento wrote in the Guardian how she has been slut-shamed , victim-blamed , bullied , and threatened on a daily basis . She had also appeared in New York with Italian actresses Laura Boldrini and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez for the Women in the World summit where she spoke publicly about her own experience in the industry and the #MeToo movement .",

		"paragraph": "It s important to remember that Wrestlemania , despite being the pinnacle of the wresting calendar , is not necessarily for the hardcore fan who watches week in and week out . It is for the casual fan , the lapsed fan , the potentially new fan watching at a friend s gathering . I m not saying this is the best way to run the show , but it s how it s been done the last few years and not something any of us can change . So by using that metric , there were some highs and a very few lows . A look at some of them : 1 ) There is no way around how terrible the main event was it was an act of delusion and/or hubris you ll seldom see on a scale this big . Poor Roman Reigns was booed every time his face appeared over the course of the night even for a split-second in a video game promo and as soon as Triple H ( who along with Stephanie McMahon had attempted but failed to reassert their heel credibility ) settled in the ring and looked for his opponent , the jeers started to rain . Even worse , some people left , with more trickling out over the course of a slog of a match . In 2014 , WWE was willing to turn the ship around by inserting Daniel Bryan into what was supposed to be a Batista/Randy Orton main event . Last year , as the crowd was sour on the build for Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar , they were again able to adjust course with a Seth Rollins cash-in . This year they just let the ship run into the rocks , then cranked up Reigns music in the building in an attempt to cover up as many of the boos as possible . It was awkward , uncomfortable and a pretty depressing way to end the night . 2 ) When you sit back and think about what the nostalgia acts are doing to current superstars they need to seem effective all year long , it does n t make a whole lot of sense . But when you are in the building when the glass breaks for Steve Austin , or The Rock s music plays , or when Mick Foley or Shawn Michaels make an appearance , the reaction from the crowd makes it all worth it . The triumvirate of Michaels , Foley and Austin especially with the brief pause before Austin came out when the crowd was almost willing him out onto stage in anticipation was a lot of fun , and I do n t think will diminish the New Day or League of Nations in the long run . Heck , Donald Trump took a Stunner from Austin in 2007 and is now carrying on a pretty successful presidential campaign . It s not necessarily a black mark going down . The Rock s appearance coupled with John Cena returning was the last moment of joy for the crowd on Sunday night , as the reality of the main event settled in on them . It s unfortunate Bray Wyatt had to be involved , because while it was nice that The Rock put him over , the eventually verbal and physical putdowns did n t help a character that has been all bark and no bite for a long while now . Three consecutive Wrestlemania appearances against three of the all-time greats ( Cena , then the Undertaker , and now The Rock ) , and not much in the way of any short or long-term gains for Wyatt . Also I m not sure why The Rock needed a flamethrower save for the fact he probably wanted a flamethrower , but so it goes . 3 ) It was a really great night for women s wrestling . The pre-show featured a ten-women tag match that was absolutely fine and gave Brie Bella a send-off to what seems like retirement . More importantly for later in the show , we had the reveal by Lita that the butterfly tattoo Diva s Title was no more , instead replaced by a women s championship . Then the triple threat women s title match was given all proper respect . Charlotte , Sasha Banks and Becky Lynch were given an awesome promo video , big entrances ( Sasha got Snoop Dogg , Charlotte a modified version of her dad s famous robes ) , big spots ( Charlotte s moonsault off the top to the outside a particularly impressive one ) and plenty of time to work . I heard some griping that the first official women s title match was won with the help of a man ( Ric Flair dragging Sasha to the outside so she could n t break up a submission attempt ) , but that is a thing heels do . Sasha and Becky had tried to neutralize Flair earlier , but he recovered and made the save for his daughter . Plenty of men s titles have been decided after the interference of both men and women , so I do n t think it s a huge deal . And despite the crowd being absolutely primed for a Sasha title win , it wo n t hurt her at all to chase the belt a little longer . Will they have the patience to wait until Summerslam ? Will a Lynch reign slip in before Banks gets her run ? The women of the WWE now have real characters , time to work and a legitimate belt for which to compete . Things are going okay . 4 ) The rest of the matches , save for the main event , did n t really have any duds . The Zack Ryder win in the Intercontinental ladder match ( a new Mania tradition after opening the show two years in a row ? ) was certainly a surprise , but the storyline of him desperately trying to hold onto it should be entertaining . Plus that match allowed Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn to shine like the stars they are while Stardust was able to deliver a tribute to his dad , Dusty Rhodes . A lot of people are upset with Chris Jericho going over A.J. Styles , but it was a good match and I m not sure how one win when Styles already has a victory over Y2J , and will likely be collecting another one or four over the coming months matters all that much . Styles is also going to be okay . The New Day vs. League of Nation tag match was just fine , with the important thing being the New Day getting the awesome entrance and attire and a chance to rub shoulders with three legends after the match . And the battle royal was a battle royal , with some celebrity spots , another burying of beloved Damien Sandow and a surprise NXT winner that might be able to springboard a rookie career . Undertaker vs. Shane McMahon was all about setting up one insane spot Shane off the cage and while we can question whether that particular dive was worth it , the crowd was into the goings on throughout . Now if you want to question why one of the Undertaker s last Wrestlemania matches was wasted on a non-wrestler , well , that s fair . The most disappointing match of the night compared to anticipation levels ( nothing comes below the main event ) , was Lesnar vs. Dean Ambrose . After building up how tough Ambrose was for the last month , he took a bunch of suplexes and one F5 ( albeit it onto some chairs ) and lost . When expected results ranged from Ambrose stealing a win to Ambrose passing out in the Kimura Lock while a bloody mess a la Bret Hart and Steve Austin , and we got Ambrose just kind of loses in a match that never really got too crazy , it was n t ideal . We will see if Ambrose stays at the main event level or gets shuffled towards the midcard as WWE attempts to clear the way for Reigns . The latter would certainly be disappointing . 5 ) All-in-all , Wrestlemania 32 delivered a fairly entertaining show despite limitations on the roster ( so , so many injuries ) and a main event nobody wanted to see that will go down as one of the worst in the event s history . It also had one of the more impressive sets in the show s history , as AT&T Stadium proved to be an absurdly impressive host from a spectacle standpoint . The nostalgia acts got huge reactions , the ladies got time to work and now the WWE has to figure out how to handle a babyface champion no one particularly likes with a real dearth of heel foes to put him against ( unless Owens is going to feud with seven people at one time , a thing he s proven he has the capacity to do ) . See you all next April in Orlando . WWE RAW airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on USA Network",

		"paragraph": "Issa Rae s very funny , great-looking HBO sitcom Insecure is back for a second season on Sunday night , and it s even better more assured and finely detailed than its excellent first season . It s easy to re-immerse yourself into the life of the fictional Issa , who continues to struggle in romance , struggle at her job , and have some laughs and lots of fierce loyalty with her girlfriends . Following last season s breakup with her boyfriend Lawrence ( Jay Ellis ) Issa was a naughty girl she is both open to new relationships and pining for her old one . Rae , who created the show and does much of the writing , has made her Insecure character the sort of person who is often the most intelligent person in the room , but this Issa too modest to flaunt her smarts and too ( yes ) insecure to assume that anyone will appreciate her as the thoughtful , charming soul she is . As a result , Issa seems to attract egotistical cads and goofballs by the score men who are n t worthy of her who feel she s not worthy of them . Rae is so good at portraying the little awkwardnesses of first dates and spontaneous hookups that you find yourself wincing while you re laughing . Issa s best friend , Molly ( Yvonne Orji ) , the high-strung corporate attorney , is back and feeling stressed at work and in her social life you get the sense that Issa and Molly may only relax and be themselves when they are together , joking but also being honest with each other about themselves . Insecure is filmed in a way that makes Los Angeles look like a constantly tempting invitation to have fun , and the show makes the most of guest stars such as Lil Rel Howery ( Get Out The Carmichael Show ) and This Is Us s Sterling K. Brown . The show is n t timid about letting in serious moments . There s a scene in the fourth episode in which Lawrence gets pulled over by a cop for making an illegal U-turn , and it seems to capture perfectly the fear and heightened confusion that a young black man can endure during an interaction with authority that many of us never experience . Insecure was criminally snubbed in the Emmy nominations announced earlier this month . It s almost shocking : Rae gives such a good performance the writing is unique in tone and full of funny lines ( I liked Molly s description of a guy she turned down : He looks like a strip-mall dentist ) and the show is beautifully directed with , as I said earlier , an eye for Los Angeles that is rare . I hope Insecure attracts solid ratings this season I worry a bit that its audience and the audience for its lead-in , Ballers ( also starting a new season on Sunday ) , do n t overlap much . Tell your friends to watch Insecure , willya ? Insecure airs Sundays at 10:30 p.m. on HBO .

		"paragraph": "It 's no secret that the Phillies are considering an upgrade at third base - both for the long and short term . They have long had their sights on Baltimore 's Manny Machado . The Orioles are expected to trade the free-agent-to-be in July . The Phillies have long been in touch with the Orioles , but do n't appear to be in a hurry to part with significant young talent for a rental player when they can pursue him with just cash in the offseason ( see story ) . Texas veteran Adrian Beltre has been mentioned as a potential short-term fit for the Phillies , but there are others , including Kansas City 's Mike Moustakas . Neither would cost anything close to the prospect outlay that Machado would . According to a baseball source , Phillies and Royals officials have had discussions about Moustakas and Royals scouts have been peeking in on prospects in the Phillies ' minor-league system in advance of a possible deal . Moustakas , who turns 30 in September , is a two-time All-Star and left-handed-hitting power bat who stroked 38 homers and drove in 85 runs in 2017 . He had hoped to ride that season to a big , free-agent payday last winter , but one never materialized and he returned to the Royals for one year and $ 6.5 million . In 78 games this season , Moustakas is hitting .255 with a .777 OPS . He has 15 homers and 49 RBIs . His on-base percentage is just .310 . That does not fit what the Phillies are looking for long term , but for the right price the Phils would probably roll the dice on Moustakas bringing some pop to the lineup for a half-season . Earlier this month , the Phillies appeared to be transitioning away from Maikel Franco at third base ( see story ) . He had lost time at the position to J.P. Crawford before Crawford went on the disabled list with a broken hand . Franco has gotten more playing time recently and responded with more production . He entered Friday night with 10 hits , including five doubles and a home run , in his last 21 at-bats ( .476 ) and had reached base in half of his 22 plate appearances to push his on-base percentage over .300 . It 's doubtful Franco 's recent surge will seal his place in the Phillies ' future , but the team will take it because it helps win games and could build some trade value . The calendar turns to July on Sunday and that typically starts the countdown to the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline . Phillies general manager Matt Klentak has indicated that his level of aggressiveness in making trades would be dictated by the team 's place in the standings as the deadline approaches . The Phillies have survived a tough June schedule . They entered Friday night 's game against Washington with a 12-13 record in June and were 43-36 overall , just two games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East . In addition to seeking an upgrade at third base , Klentak will monitor the market for available starting and relief pitching .",

Photos taken during filming of the movie , which is produced by Rogen and Evan Goldberg , showed a stand-in for child actor Keith L.

While the stand-in was also African-American , his lighter skin was apparently darkened to appear more like the shade of 11-year-old Williams s skin . While sources close to the production company , Good Universe , initially told TMZ it s not uncommon for lighting purposes to match actors skin tones , Rogen apologized on Thursday and said it will never happen again . I should start by saying this should n t have happened , and I m terribly sorry it did , Rogen told IndieWire . I wo n t give excuses for why it happened . I ll just say that as soon [ as ] I was made aware of it , I ensured we put an end to it and I give my word that on any project my team and I are involved in , we will take every precaution to make sure something similar does not take place again . He ended by saying , I m engaging in conversations to make sure I find the best way to do that . It s on me to be proactive . Reacting is n t enough . IndieWire also spoke with several cinematographers and one director of photography about the claim that the practice was not uncommon for lighting purposes , but it was told that just was n t true . One person , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said , I ve seen wigs used and powder to take down shine , but maybe not as extreme as what is being suggested here .

		"paragraph": "Kris Osborn Security , The Navy has now completed at least one-fourth of the design drawings and begun advanced work on a stealthy \" electric drive \" propulsion system for the emerging nuclear-armed Columbia-Class ballistic missile submarines -- as part of its strategy to engineer the quietest , most technically advanced and least detectable submarine of all time . The Columbia class , slated to begin full construction by 2021 , is to be equipped with an electric-drive propulsion train , as opposed to the mechanical-drive propulsion train used on other Navy submarines . The electric-drive system is expected to be quieter ( i.e. , stealthier ) than a mechanical-drive system , a Congressional Research Service report on Columbia-Class submarines from earlier this year states . In today s Ohio-class submarines , a reactor plant generates heat which creates steam , Navy officials explained . The steam then turns turbines which produce electricity and also propel the ship forward through reduction gears which are able to translate the high-speed energy from a turbine into the shaft RPMs needed to move a boat propeller . Designed to be 560-feet long and house 16 Trident II D5 missiles fired from 44-foot-long missile tubes , Columbia-Class submarines will use a quieting X-shaped stern configuration . Of the required design disclosures ( drawings ) , 26-percent have been issued , and the program is on a path to have 83-percent issued by construction start , Bill Couch , spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command , told Warrior Maven several months ago . The X - shaped stern will restore maneuverability to submarines as submarine designs progressed from using a propeller to using a propulsor to improve quieting , submarines lost some surface maneuverability , senior Navy officials told Warrior Maven in previous interviews . Navy developers explained that electric-drive propulsion technology still relies on a nuclear reactor to generate heat and create steam to power turbines . However , the electricity produced is transferred to an electric motor rather than so-called reduction gears to spin the boat 's propellers . The use of an electric motor brings other advantages as well , according to an MIT essay written years ago when electric drive was being evaluated for submarine propulsion . Using an electric motor optimizes use of installed reactor power in a more efficient way compared with mechanical drive submarines , making more on-board power available for other uses , according to an essay called Evaluation and Comparison of Electric Propulsion Motors for Submarines . \" Author Joel Harbour says that on mechanical drive submarine , 80-percent of the total reactor power is used exclusively for propulsion . With an electric drive submarine , the installed reactor power of the submarine is first converted into electrical power and then delivered to an electric propulsion motor . The now available electrical potential not being used for propulsion could easily be tapped into for other uses , he writes . Research , science and technology work and initial missile tube construction on Columbia-Class submarines has been underway for several years . One key exercise , called tube-and-hull forging , involves building four-packs of missile tubes to assess welding and construction methods . These structures are intended to load into the boat s modules as construction advances . Early procurement of missile tubes and prototyping of the first assembly of four missile tubes are supporting the proving out of production planning , Couch said .

While the Columbia-Class is intended to replace the existing fleet of Ohio-Class ballistic missile submarines , the new boats include a number of not-yet-seen technologies as well as different configurations when compared with the Ohio-Class . The Columbia-Class will have 16 launch tubes rather than the 24 tubes current on Ohio boats , yet the Columbias will also be about 2-tons larger , according to Navy information . The Columbia-Class , to be operational by the 2028 , is a new generation of technically advanced submarines intended to quietly patrol the undersea realm around the world to ensure second-strike ability should the US be hit with a catastrophic nuclear attack . The nuclear-armed submarines are expected to serve all the way into and beyond the 2080s . General Dynamics Electric Boat has begun acquiring long-lead items in anticipation of beginning construction the process involves acquiring metals , electronics , sonar arrays and other key components necessary to build the submarines . Both the Pentagon and the Navy are approaching this program with a sense of urgency , given the escalation of the current global threat environment . Many senior DoD officials have called the Columbia-Class program as a number one priority across all the services . The Columbia-Class submarine program is leveraging enhanced acquisition authorities provided by Congress such as advanced procurement , advanced construction and multi-year continuous production of missile tubes , Couch added . Kris Osborn previously served at the Pentagon as a Highly Qualified Expert with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army - Acquisition , Logistics & Technology . Osborn has also worked as a correspondent for Fox News and an anchor and on-air military specialist at CNN and CNN Headline News . This first appeared in Warrior Maven here .",

The South American trio formed a fearsome attack under Luis Enrique at Camp Nou , inspiring Barca to the treble in their first season together in 2014-15 . The Catalans went on to win the 2015 Club World Cup , a domestic double in 2015-16 and the Copa del Rey again a year later with their ' MSN ' forward line , before Neymar left for PSG in 2017 for a world-record 222million fee .

But the 26-year-old says he misses playing alongside his friends at Barca , adding that they got on so well that they would poke fun at each other even during matches . \" We were doing great with Messi , and then came Suarez .

		"paragraph": "Audi s first regular-production electric model , the e-tron Quattro , will arrive in showrooms in about a year . We got our first good look at the model when the firm released 250 camouflage-clad prototypes on the streets of Geneva , Switzerland , in March 2018 . We later learned about what s under the sheet metal , and now Audi is giving us a preview of what it s like to ride inside its next SUV . The e-tron is significant partly because it will usher in the design language that will characterize every upcoming electric member of the Audi lineup . The camouflage intentionally leaves little to the imagination . We can tell the e-tron stands out from Audi s gasoline-powered crossovers with a powertrain-specific octagonal grille that s wider , shorter , and accented by chromed vertical slats . It s flanked by sharp headlights that give the e-tron the typical Audi look . Around back , we see intricately designed lights connected by a thin LED strip . In terms of size , it s slightly bigger than the Q5 . What you see above is what you ll get , albeit without the psychedelic wrap . Peter Mertens , Audi s board member for technical development , told Digital Trends the company remains committed to bringing the model to production with cameras in lieu of door mirrors , a forward-thinking feature car companies have tried to make a reality for years . Each camera transfers the footage it captures to a seven-inch OLED screen neatly integrated into the corresponding door panel , so you ll still look left or right to see what s behind you . The driver can zoom in and out of the image and choose between three modes designed for highway driving , turning , and parking , respectively . It s a feature that improves range by reducing drag while giving the car a high-tech , futuristic look . It s cool , right ? It s also illegal in the United States , so the e-tron we ll see in showrooms will come with regular , old-fashioned mirrors . Audi is working on changing the regulations . There are three additional screens inside the e-tron . The first one replaces the analog instrument cluster behind the steering wheel . It s the familiar driver-configurable virtual cockpit found in other members of the Audi family , like the latest A7 and the all-new Q8 . The second one displays the infotainment system . We have n t tested it yet but we expect good things we ve previously praised Audi s infotainment system as one of the best on the market . Finally , the third screen groups the climate control functions and lets the front passengers use the handwriting recognition function to manually write an address into the navigation . Going electric allowed interior designers to carve out more space for people and gear than in a comparable gasoline-powered SUV . There is no need for a bulky transmission tunnel , there is no mechanical link between the front and rear wheels , so the rear passengers benefit from what Audi calls a flat plateau . Special soundproofing and body sealing keeps wind noise at bay while the electric motor emits only a gentle hum . It creates a calm , relaxed atmosphere in which to rock out to the available 16-speaker , 705-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system . Fully digitalized , the e-tron Quattro will usher in an on-demand over-the-air updating system that lets customers purchase features days , weeks , months , or years into the ownership period . Buyers will be able to upgrade how the headlights illuminate the road , for example . It s conceivable they ll also be able to unlock more range and/or more power , either for a weekend trip or for the life of the vehicle . The sheet metal hides an electrified version of the MLB platform used widely across the company s lineup . In this application , it s built around a 1,576-pound , 95-kWh lithium-ion battery pack mounted directly under the passenger compartment , right in between the axles . Performance specifications remain under wraps . All we know at this point is that as the name Quattro implies it will offer weather-beating all-wheel drive . Audi is n t ready to talk about real-world range yet , either . Mertens promised Digital Trends the e-tron Quattro will be very , very competitive in that respect but he did n t go into specific details . We know the e-tron will become the first volume-produced electric car compatible with 150-kilowatt charging , which is capable of zapping the battery with an 80 percent charge ( roughly 200 miles ) in 30 minutes . To put that figure into perspective , Tesla s Supercharger stations top out at 120 kilowatts . The 2019 Audi e-tron Quattro will make its world debut in the United States before the end of the year . Sales will begin shortly after , though Audi has already started taking deposits in certain markets . The company told British magazine Autocar it s considering offering the e-tron Quattro through a monthly subscription service , a model Volvo has already adopted . When it lands , the Audi e-tron Quattro will fight in the same segment as the Tesla Model X and Jaguar I-Pace . The crossover will be part of a multi-pronged foray into electric car territory . Audi will launch a second battery-powered model named e-tron Sportback about a year after the Quattro makes its debut .",

		"paragraph": "Yahoo s second-quarter earnings per share missed expectations , while its revenue beat expectations but none of it matters much . Analysts expected Yahoo to report earnings of 10 cents per share , down from 16 cents a year ago . Instead , it reported 9 cents . For revenue , analysts predicted $ 1.08 billion , which would have been a 13 % drop instead , revenue came in at $ 1.31 billion . All eyes have been on the company leading up to this earnings report , but not because of earnings . The only story that matters to the market right now is the potential sale of the company . Has a company s quarterly earnings announcement ever been so highly scrutinized and anticipated , for reasons having little to do with the earnings ? Revenue from the division Yahoo calls MaVeNS ( mobile , video , native ads , and social ) , a key focus , rose 7 % in the first quarter , but that was seen as a disappointment after the category rose 26 % in the quarter before . In the second quarter , MaVeNS rose 26 % . Suntrust downgraded Yahoo to neutral in advance of the earnings , despite the fact that , We expect a positive result ( ~ $ 6B in total ) . If the company has already selected a winning bid , positive or negative earnings are n t going to change sentiment . Many are expecting Yahoo to announce the buyer of choice on Monday along with its earnings , or to at least say or indicate something about the process . But it is under no obligation to do so , and the head-scratching and speculation may continue for weeks . It s also still possible that even after such a public bidding process , Yahoo could still delay a sale analysts believe that is what CEO Marissa Mayer wants , though activist investor Starboard Value feels differently . If Yahoo does sell , the leading bids for Yahoo or for pieces of Yahoo have reportedly come from : Verizon AT&T Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert with financial backing from Warren Buffett private equity group Advent International private equity group TPG and private equity firm Sycamore in partnership with Vector Capital Management . Yahoo says it is not commenting on the process until a definitive agreement has been reached . For all the hue and cry over Yahoo s sale process , and all the negative hot-takes by the tech media , the truth is that no one really knows anything . If all the apparent leaks are to be believed , everyone has a sense of the companies still bidding , but even that list , thought to be a general consensus , could be wrong . The price Yahoo could fetch is also highly uncertain . Factors like Yahoo s patents , its media business ( including Yahoo Finance ) , and its stake in Alibaba have led some analysts to report that the company could fetch much more than the $ 3.5 to $ 5 billion range most media outlets have settled on . Suntrust , in a new note , points out that , Yahoo is running two auctions in parallel core sale and Excalibur patent portfolio so we would n t be surprised to see multiple winners . We expect the core to generate ~ $ 6B in aggregate , in one or multiple transactions . Amidst all the scrutiny , Yahoo s stock has risen 4 % in the last three months , and 32 % in the last six . It s worth noting that Yahoo stock , which has often closely matched the performance of Alibaba stock , decoupled somewhat from Alibaba last November through this January . Then they rejoined for a time , and decoupled again in the past few days . What Yahoo could fetch in the end from interested buyers if it does sell is anyone s guess .

		"paragraph": "On the day after the election , Chelsea Handler was so devastated , she wanted to move to Spain . Then she came to work on her Netflix talk show in Culver City and saw the faces of her staff . The millennial women in her office hugged her and begged her not to retreat . They all just said , â€˜ You re our only outlet . You re our mouthpiece . That will motivate anybody , and it motivates me , Handler says , lounging in the living room of her house in Bel-Air with her dogs , Chunk and Tammy . Her streaming talk show , Chelsea , has taken a hard stand against Trump , as Handler helped register 17,000 voters and lined up recent guests like California Sen. Barbara Boxer , Van Jones , and Jake Tapper . The comedian , who plans to lead the Women s March at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 21 , spoke with Variety about how she ll continue to call out Trump . You just wrapped the first season of your show on Netflix . How does it feel ? It feels right . We have more of an impact being on Netflix than I would have had on another network , because we have a huge international audience . It s nice to be able to let them know that just because this man is our president , this is not a representation of everybody in our country . It s a representation of less than half the people . Would you ever want to interview Donald Trump ? No . Why not ? Why would I ? I do n t ever want to see him . I do n t ever want to interact with him , which wo n t be a problem . Once he came up to me in a restaurant in L.A. to introduce himself to tell me he s Donald Trump . I said , Great . What do you think the role of your show will be during a Trump presidency ? First and foremost , I m a comedian . But also , we have to hold him accountable . And we have to make fun of him , just like you d make fun of anybody who was president . Obama was boring in that sense there was nothing to make fun of because he was so responsible and such a leader . Do you think your show will be more serious going forward ? I think the great thing that Netflix has afforded me is to be serious when it calls for it . I m not going to be funny on the day after the election , when I was horrified and crying all night . It was going to be a celebratory day . I walked into my office that morning , and I thought , There s no way I m going to be able to do this . Were you surprised that you cried on air ? Yeah . The last thing you ever want to do is break down . It s just so unprofessional . But my whole life is being unprofessional . There s been a lot of talk of how the media did n t treat Hillary Clinton fairly . Absolutely . 100 percent . What could they have done differently ? Stop covering [ Trump ] so much . They were treating him as an entertainer first . It was a reality show . We ve turned into a reality show . I blame the Kardashians , personally the beginning of the end was the Kardashians . The way these people have blown up and do n t go away it s surreal . Everyone is for sale . We re looking at a man that gets mad at Vanity Fair for reviewing his restaurant poorly . By the way , have you ever been to that restaurant ? It s the biggest piece of garbage you ve ever walked into . That place looks like a Southwest airport lounge . It s the worst . The fact that there have been so many scandals on his campaign was reminiscent of a reality show . Somebody should have put a stop to it . The idea that so many people were so wrong about the outcome is so screwed up . The fact that Russia is interfering with our election is beyond repair . How do we ever recover from that ? What s to prevent them from doing it for the rest of our lives ? Women were an important part of Clinton s coalition . Yet Megyn Kelly was attacked when she called out Trump s sexism . I like Megyn Kelly . She s a badass . There s a toddler in the White House , and it s not one of the children . The other thing about his children , they have absolutely no influence over him . The idea that Ivanka is going to help women , or do anything for women , is absurd , because she s a puppet . They re all his puppets . They re scared s tless of him , and the fact that they re still around him means they have never stood up to him . Did you see that Trump met with Kanye West ? Kanye needs to get on his meds . Could Trump be impeached ? I hope so . Probably . But how would they even get him out of there ? He does n t abide by laws and rules . They d have to physically remove him . It s becoming clearer what a sociopath he is . I think our job as entertainers or my job is to reach across and figure out the people who are so disenchanted that they voted for him , and try to find some common ground . Do you think a Trump voter could watch your show ? Yeah , I think so . As long as you re not racist or a bigot , we can find common ground . A lot of these people do n t have time to watch the news . They are working three jobs . I get that the working class is fed up . That s important to get . When there s such divisiveness , it s so ugly . Who wants to f king fight all the time ?

		"paragraph": "Warning : This mini-recap for the Beyond the Wall episode of Game of Thrones contains spoilers . Well , that was a gut-punch . Though many of us suspected Jon Snow s scheme to capture a wight would probably not go well , I do n t think any of us expected THAT character would die . We re talking , of course , about Daenerys s dragon . In a scene that paralleled the Lannister army incineration a few weeks back , Daenerys swooped in to save Jon Snow s posse from hordes of ice zombies . But where the Lannisters anti-dragon crossbow merely inflicted a flesh wound , the Night King s magical ice javelin ended in FATALITY . After the poor beast exploded into flames and sprayed blood all over the tundra , it died gruesomely and sank into frozen waters . It s safe to say this was the biggest death Game of Thrones has featured yet . ( Literally . ) But then â€¦ Ladies and gentleman : We now have an undead ice dragon in the mix . That s right , the Night King brought the dragon back to life and the Lord of Light only knows what that means for our heroes . Though we were n t quite as emotionally attached to the ( pre-zombie ) dragon as its mother Daenerys was , this episode constituted a devastating blow to Daenerys s forces and raises further questions about whether she really can pull out a victory in this here game of thrones . But hey , at least Jon Snow and Daenerys can grief-bond over it ! From the way her eyes danced across his chest scars and also the steamy moment when they held hands for three seconds , it s clear these two are finally falling for each other . Stay tuned . Beyond the Wall unfortunately also contained one of the worst plotlines in Game of Thrones history : Arya becoming the lamest character of all . Every time we cut back to Winterfell , she was hating on Sansa and pontificating like a holier-than-thou James Bond villain about Sansa s life . ( Uh , girl , maybe double-check with the all-knowing oracle in the yard if you have any questions about what Sansa s been up to . ) For her part , Sansa did not defend herself well , and even fell for a classic Littlefinger trick by sending Brienne on an errand rather than keep her in Winterfell for protection . Between this , Bran s terrible new personality , and Jon Snow s admittedly boneheaded plan to capture a zombie , the Stark family is not the best lately . Will this house s incompetence single-handedly destroy Westeros ? We re about to find out . Anyway , this is just the tip of the ice javelin , so be sure to check back soon for our full photo recap !

		"paragraph": "I used to push my shopping cart down the makeup aisle , watching the pinks and plums and reds flash by , wishing I could stop and drink them in but terrified to be seen doing it . I d never bought lipstick before . I d never bought any makeup before . To me , they d always been forbidden , something I could barely look at , let alone touch . I knew I was a woman for a long time before I decided to transition . Those years were torture , every day playing the part of a man , knowing it was a lie , paralyzed by the thought of anyone finding out , and of ever doing anything about it . When I finally decided I had to come out as trans , one of my very first thoughts was makeup . This is the kind of thing that bigots scoff at as the trappings of femininity , but those people do n t understand how important makeup can be . I did n t understand it entirely myself , even as I entered the MAC store for the first time , with my friend Karina at my side . I was presenting entirely male at the time there was nothing about my appearance that implied my womanhood . I was very good at hiding . I almost bailed . Karina had to drag me into the store , where my mind went suddenly blank when the clerk approached us . Karina pointed at me and said , She has never bought makeup before and needs help picking some things out . I just stood there , trying to breathe . Nobody had ever referred to me as she before . For me , makeup was n t about hiding my appearance it was about uncovering who I truly was . Hang on , the store clerk said . She returned with a tall , gorgeous blonde woman named Shannon , who whisked me away to her chair . I d worn lipstick before , sneaking it from my mother s vanity as a kid when no one was around , but never as an adult . And now here was Shannon holding out a tube of something called Twig and asking me to try it on . It changed my face . I have great lips it s just a fact . My cupid s bow is pronounced , and my lower lip is big and pouty . When I saw the brownish-pink nude of Twig spread out across them , I caught a glimpse of a woman looking back at me in the mirror , maybe for the first time . But because I mostly still presented as male , other customers were staring at me . I tried to act like it did n t bother me , like this was something I did all the time and it was totally natural . But inside I was thinking , I ca n t do it . I ca n t transition . It s too hard . It s too scary . I looked at Shannon and she could see the tears in my eyes . Does it ever get easier ? I asked , now crying for real . She gave me a gentle smile that contained a world of emotion . Yes , honey . It does . I promise . She hugged me and I left the store feeling hopeful . Some of the most important changes in life are the ones we do n t notice happening . A few months later , I started living full-time as a woman . In those early months , makeup was my shield against the world . Without makeup , I was likely to be gendered as male and called sir . But add some eye shadow and lipstick , and suddenly I became ma am . For me , makeup was n t about hiding my appearance it was about uncovering who I truly was . I did n t wear Twig every day , but I wore it most days . Twig was comforting , with its particular taste and consistency and that made me feel safe . As the months slowly passed , so did my transition . Hormones began to reshape the contours of my face in subtle , but important , ways . My hair grew and I colored it blonde . I got laser hair removal on my face to remove the telltale shadow of beard from my cheeks and chin . The way I moved , the way I spoke , the way my expressions played across my face underwent an evolution . I transitioned . I caught a glimpse of a woman looking back at me in the mirror , maybe for the first time . More than a year later , I do n t wear makeup quite as often as I used to . When people look at me now , they see a woman . I no longer need makeup to define me as such to the rest of the world but I still love it . A few days ago , I brushed on a very subtle eye and then reached for my old friend , Twig . I removed the lid and twisted the base and saw something I d never seen before : the bottom of the tube . I managed to awkwardly coat my lips with the tiny wedge of product remaining and then stared at what was left . It was so small . I took a picture of it and Tweeted about the day I got it , and Shannon , and how she promised me things would get better . When you put on lipstick , it does n t look like anything has happened to the lipstick itself . It gets worn down slowly , over weeks and months . You ca n t see the change happening before your eyes . You only notice much later , when things have become noticeably different . So much in life is like that , including gender transition . I took hormones , I grew out my hair , I got laser hair removal , and I wanted all of the big changes to happen overnight . But they did n t . For a long time it felt like I was doing all this stuff and nothing at all was happening . It was so easy to get discouraged when I kept showing up day in and day out and taking the same pills and looking in the same mirror and putting on the same lipstick and I just wanted something to be different . Of course , it was changing . But some of the most important changes in life are the ones we do n t notice happening . I wish I could say that life is perfect now , but it s not . Being trans is hard . Coming out can be costly it cost me friends , a couple of loved ones , and even my job . But even through all that , it s worth it . It s so worth it . Because the falsehood that I endured for so long is over and I can finally get on with my life . It s okay that there s still work to be done . The other day , I cracked open a new tube of Twig . It still has the stiffness of a new product it has n t conformed to my lips yet . I wonder what this tube and I will go through together , and who I ll be when it s gone in turn . I ca n t wait to find out . Related : Why I 'm Growing Out My Beard as a Trans Femme",

		"paragraph": "By Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A woman carrying her young son confronted Scott Pruitt , the scandal-plagued chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , at a Washington eatery and politely asked him to resign to make way for somebody who will protect the environment . Pruitt looked on in silence on Monday as the woman , Kristin Mink , criticized the EPA for relaxing fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks and Pruitt for paying \" $ 50 bucks a night to stay in a D.C. condo that 's connected to an energy lobbying firm , \" according to a video posted on her Facebook page . \" This is my son . He loves animals , he loves clean air , he loves clean water , \" said Mink , toddler on her hip , scribbled notes in her hand and a stuffed animal sticking out of a back pocket . \" We deserve to have somebody at the EPA who actually does protect our environment , somebody who believes in climate change and takes it seriously , for the benefit of all of us including our children , \" she added . \" So I would urge you to resign before your scandals push you out . \" Pruitt did not respond on the video . \" Administrator Pruitt always welcomes input from Americans , whether they agree or disagree with the decisions being made at EPA . This is evident by him listening to her comments and going on to thank her , which is not shown in the video , \" EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson said . A congressional panel is investigating Pruitt 's use of the condominium tied to an energy industry lobbyist . Pruitt is also under fire for frequently flying first class and purchasing costly items for his office , including a soundproof telephone booth . He is the latest administration official to be confronted while dining by a member of the public who was protesting Trump policies . Last month , White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in Lexington , Virginia , and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled at a downtown restaurant . Asked about the Pruitt incident , Sanders told Fox News Americans should be able to disagree , but in a way \" that does n't call for people to never be able to step foot in public . \" Mink , whose LinkedIn page says she is a teacher at Sidwell Friends , a Washington private school , said she believed Pruitt should be held accountable for his actions . \" He 's corrupt , he 's a liar , he 's a climate change denier , and as a public servant , he should not be able to go out in public without hearing from the citizens he 's hurting , \" she said in a Facebook post .

A little boy should not have to say goodbye to his partner in crime , his play mate , his best friend , his little sister , wrote Matt Sooter of a tender moment shared between his kids on the Facebook page Hope for Addy Joy Fighting DIPG on June 2 . This is n t how it s supposed to be . But this is the broken world we live in . Addy s symptoms have progressed rapidly over the past day and a half . Yesterday she woke up as her spunky playful self . While we still see short instances of our girl she can no longer eat or swallow without difficulty and she s sleeping most of the time now and we ve admitted her into inpatient care . Most likely she does n t have much time left . Matt added , For our family and close friends if you feel you need to tell her goodbye we recommend you contact us and do so soon . Pray for Jackson . He does n t want to leave her side and we wo n t make him . Pray for us . That we have the right words and can make the necessary arrangements in time . Always remember : God is in this situation , He s up to something , and He s up to something GOOD . The photo has collected 3,600 likes and almost 1,000 shares . In November 2016 Addy , who lived in Rogers , Ark. , was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontene glioma ( DIPG ) , which , according to Boston Children s Hospital , is a highly aggressive and difficult to treat tumor at the brain s base . In an essay published by the Advertiser , a Lafayette , La.-based website , Matt wrote that signs of Addy s illness presented at a Missouri theme park when his mother remarked that the girl , then 2 , was having trouble walking , a symptom the family surmised was fatigue or a growth spurt . However , when Addy began falling and experiencing tremors in her hand , she was given an MRI , followed by an unthinkable diagnosis . The short version , they were fairly certain our daughter had a tumor growing in her brain stem , it was aggressive , there was no treatment and therefore no cure , and it was going to take our little girl from us in a matter of months , wrote Matt . Last year Addy underwent experimental treatment in Monterrey , Mexico , trips that Matt told People could last 12 days at a time . The magazine also reported that the family spent more than $ 200,000 in medical expenses . On May 10 , Matt shared a solemn update with the Facebook group . I know you ve all been waiting for MRI results . I wish I had better news , he wrote . Addy s MRI shows that her tumor has spread . It has moved down the brain stem into the cerebellum which is likely what caused the need for her shunt . There is also a large mass in her spine that is placing pressure on her spinal cord â€¦ our doctors here have no options for us , and it seems the treatment in Mexico is no longer working . We re out of options . We are shattered . Everything within us screams to keep fighting , but we ve run out of weapons with which to do so . Addy is losing ground quickly . We do n t know how much time we have her for so we re going to make the most of it . Thank you for your prayers . The little girl passed away on June 3 stubbornly but also peacefully , wrote Matt on Facebook . She was n t in any pain at the end . For those who were wishing to say goodbye I m so sorry . This all happened so much faster than we expected , but that in itself is a blessing because she suffered so little at the end . We will let you all know once services are scheduled . Thank you for being a part of our little girl s miracle . While this is only goodbye for now we miss our baby girl terribly .

		"paragraph": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says a March rate hike is on the table . At a speech before the Executives Club of Chicago , Yellen said , given how close we are to meeting our statutory goals , and in the absence of new developments that might materially worsen the economic outlook , the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016 . Adding that , In short , we currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect . Indeed , at our meeting later this month , the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations , in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate . And so for the markets , March is likely a done deal after Yellen s comments . Ahead of this speech , Fed Funds futures data from the CME Group implied a 75 % chance the Fed would raise interest rates in its next policy statement on March 15 . Data from Bloomberg suggested a 90 % chance of a hike from the Fed . Following the speech , Ian Shepherdson , an economist at Pantheon Macro , said , In one line : They ll hike this month unless payrolls are disastrous . This would be the third interest rate increase for the Fed since the financial crisis , and the second in three months . At the outset of the year , Fed projections forecast three rate hikes in 2017 while many in markets believed we d likely see one or two hikes . In each of 2015 and 2016 , the Fed raised rates just once . Following Yellen s comments , U.S. stocks remained roughly unchanged after having traded just slightly in negative territory earlier in the session . Meanwhile , interest rates continued to back up , particularly on the short end of the yield curve with the U.S. 2-year Treasury note trading at its highest since June 2009 after the text of this speech was released . The 10-year Treasury was trading right at 2.5 % while the 30-year was at 3.1 % . Earlier this week , markets reacted to comments from New York Fed president Bill Dudley and Fed governor Lael Brainard , both of whom seemed to indicate a March rate hike would be justified . Dudley told CNN , the case for tightening monetary policy has become a lot more compelling , according to Reuters . While Brainard , considered one of the most dovish Fed officials said Wednesday in a speech that , recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a transition . With full employment within reach , signs of progress on our inflation mandate , and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad , it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation . Yellen s speech was largely expected to be an affirmation of the confidence in the economy displayed by Dudley and Brainard earlier this week . And it appears the Chair met those expectations . And while Fed rate hikes are likely to be seen by some as affirmation of the U.S. economy s strength following a deep post-crisis recession , the beginning of rate hikes often marks the beginning of the end for stock bull markets . Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance . Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland Read more from Myles here : I am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve s monetary policy . I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain , as clearly as we can , both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that underlie our strategy . Today I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years since the onset of the financial crisis . Although the Federal Reserve s policy strategy for systematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability has not changed during this period , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way . I will spend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee has made since 2014 , a year that I see as a turning point , when the FOMC began to transition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it back . The process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace than most FOMC participants anticipated in 2014 . Both unexpected economic developments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global economies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and , consequently , the appropriate stance of monetary policy , both in the near term and the longer run . Looking ahead , we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate . However , given how close we are to meeting our statutory goals , and in the absence of new developments that might materially worsen the economic outlook , the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016 . I should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation mostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions , which my FOMC colleagues and I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when our actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates .1 Assessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation In our monetary policy deliberations , the FOMC always faces two fundamental questions : First , how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy ? Second , what are the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward ? These questions are difficult because the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex . Policy affects the economy through many different channels , and , in turn , many factors influence the appropriate course of policy . Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time . A useful concept in this regard is the neutral real federal funds rate , defined as the level of the federal funds rate that , when adjusted for inflation , is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential . In effect , a neutral policy stance is one where monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator . Although the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in assessing policy , it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate stands . As a result , and as I described in a recent speech , my colleagues and I consider a wide range of information when assessing that rate .2 As I will discuss , our assessments of the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years . In the Committee s most recent projections last December , most FOMC participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in the vicinity of 1 percent .3 This level is quite low by historical standards , reflecting , in part , slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States , but also in many advanced economies . Moreover , the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several additional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis , such as subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession . It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of the effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are subject to a great deal of uncertainty . Some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent .4 With the actual value of the real federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent , a near-zero estimate of the neutral real rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative , an assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a pace around 180,000 net new jobs per month that is notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth between 75,000 and 125,000 per month .5 As I will explain , this policy stance seems appropriate given that the underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent . But as that gap closes , with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum employment objective , the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance . My colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate will rise to its longer-run level over the next few years . This expectation partly underlies our view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead : Those increases would keep the economy from significantly overheating , thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability . Post-Crisis Period : Same Strategy , New Tactics I will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC deliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate from the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability . The FOMC s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles . First , our monetary policy must be goal driven . We must take care to ensure that our decisions over time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve s congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability , and that the public understands and has confidence in that commitment . Second , our monetary policy must be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag . Among other things , this implies looking through short-term and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook roughly two or three years out when making policy decisions . Third , our monetary policy must be risk sensitive . Because the outlook is uncertain , we must assess appropriate policy with an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be significantly wrong . We have followed this basic strategy for decades and , in 2012 , the FOMC formalized it in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy . 6 The Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually . But the challenges brought about by the financial crisis , and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that followed , compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy . In particular , once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008 , it became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently low inflation .7 Those tools especially our large-scale securities purchases and increasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal funds rate enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the U.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally . Much has been written and said already about the provision of additional accommodation between 2008 and 2014 , when the FOMC completed its latest round of large-scale securities purchases , so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014 , when the FOMC s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to scaling it back .8 2014 : A Turning Point for Monetary Policy By late 2013 , the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient progress , and the outlook was sufficiently favorable , that it should reduce the pace of its large-scale securities purchases . But we reiterated that these purchases would continue until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially . The U.S. economy made notable progress toward the FOMC s statutory goals during 2014 , with the unemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year well below its Great-Recession peak of 10 percent and other measures of labor market conditions also showing improvement : Payroll gains were solid job openings had risen significantly and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs a sign of confidence in the labor market was rising back toward pre-crisis levels . We were also seeing progress on achieving our price stability goal : Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013 . Inflation seemed to be moving toward the FOMC s 2 percent objective , a level that the FOMC judges to be consistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure prominently into people s and businesses economic decisions but high enough to serve as a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address economic weakness . The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer necessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to add to the Federal Reserve s holdings of longer-term securities . Accordingly , the Committee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year , ending its purchases in October . That step , however , did not mark an immediate shift toward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases . Moreover , as the Committee explained in a set of normalization principles issued that September , the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for the federal funds rate .9 We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate because , while the U.S. economy was stronger and closer to meeting our statutory goals , we saw significant room for improvement . In particular , the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run normal level that is , the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy is operating at maximum employment and inflation remained below the 2 percent objective . Because my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would continue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term , we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong enough that we should start to scale back our support . Indeed , the FOMC s June 2014 Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP ) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw a higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year . In contrast , only two participants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that rate in the next calendar year . Uneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016 In 2015 , the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had anticipated in 2014 . However , a series of unanticipated global developments beginning in the second half of 2014 including a prolonged decline in oil prices , a sizable appreciation of the dollar , and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad ended up having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the United States , prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a slower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014 . U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth generally surprised to the downside in 2015 , reflecting , in part , weak economic activity abroad , the earlier appreciation of the dollar , and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment . This unanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the sustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and , thus , of likely progress toward our maximum employment goal . Our worry was reinforced by our assessment that , with the federal funds rate still near zero , there would likely be only limited scope for us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity turned out to be persistent . In contrast , if the weakening proved transitory and the economy instead began to overheat , threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level , the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy . Inflation also was lower than expected , with headline PCE prices rising less than 1 percent over the course of 2015 , instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated in June 2014 . Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar . My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on inflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be transitory . However , we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline in inflation could prove to be longer lasting , especially given that inflation had already been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time .10 These various considerations , along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions which I will discuss shortly explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the federal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015 , substantially less than the full percentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants reported in June 2014 . 2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to proceed cautiously . During the first half of the year , mixed readings on the job market , along with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth , suggested again that progress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing markedly . Meanwhile , inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation continued to exert downward pressure on import prices , and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the Brexit referendum posed new risks to U.S. economic activity and inflation . Moreover , even as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016 , the unemployment rate remained relatively flat , suggesting that perhaps there was more room for improvement in the job market than we had previously thought . Those unanticipated developments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more slowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year . We ended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage point over the course of 2016 , rather than the full percentage point suggested by our December 2015 projections . Reassessing Longer-Run Conditions The slower-than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and 2016 reflected more than just the inflation , job market , and foreign developments I mentioned . During that period , the FOMC and most private forecasters generally lowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate . Indeed , at our October 2015 meeting , the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of neutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that those rates had declined both here and abroad , and that the decline had been going on for some time . In response to this growing evidence , the median assessment by FOMC participants of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1-3/4 percent in June 2014 to 1-1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016 . These reassessments reflected , in part , the persistence of surprisingly sluggish productivity growth both in the United States and abroad and suggested that fewer federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back accommodation . Partly in response to persistently slow wage growth , FOMC participants and private forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment . The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to approximately 4-3/4 percent in December 2016 . Other things being equal , a lower longer-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to create jobs without generating too much inflation .11 Thus , the downward revisions to FOMC participants views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to our assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had anticipated in 2014 . Further Progress since Mid-2016 The U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse shocks in recent years , and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the Committee s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals . Job gains have remained quite solid , and the unemployment rate , at 4.8 percent in January , is now in line with the median of FOMC participants estimates of its longer-run normal level . On the whole , the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging , particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat . The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly balanced . Moreover , after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016 , inflation moved up during the second half of 2016 , mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices . More recently , higher energy prices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation , with the total PCE price index rising nearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January . Core PCE inflation which excludes volatile energy and food prices and , therefore , tends to be a better indicator of future inflation has been running near 1-3/4 percent . Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up , on net , in recent months , although they remain low . With the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target , the median assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4 percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate over the course of this year . In light of current economic conditions , such an increase would be consistent with the Committee s expectation that it will raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds rate close to some estimates of its current neutral level . However , partly because my colleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the longer run , we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019 . Our individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years , labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further , and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term . In short , we currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect . Indeed , at our meeting later this month , the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations , in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate . Nonetheless , as we have said many times and as my discussion today demonstrates monetary policy can not be and is not on a preset course . As in 2015 and 2016 , the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for monetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook . Monetary Policy Is Not a Panacea The U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability , but we of course recognize that important challenges remain . For instance , as we noted in our latest Monetary Policy Report to the Congress , the ongoing expansion has been the slowest since World War II , with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year .12 This subdued pace reflects , in part , slower growth in the labor force in recent years compared with much of the post-World War II period and disappointing productivity growth both in the United States and abroad . Our report also noted that , despite a notable pickup in 2015 , real incomes for the median family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession , and the gains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income distribution , as has been the case for quite some time . Families at the 10th percentile of the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007 , whereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more . In addition , the economic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics , while improved since the depths of the recession , remain worse , on average , that those of whites or Asians . These unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that lie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy . Monetary policy can not , for instance , generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would boost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income inequality . And monetary policy can not improve the productivity of American workers . Fiscal and regulatory policies which are of course the responsibility of the Administration and the Congress are best suited to address such adverse structural trends . Conclusion To conclude , we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our congressionally mandated goals . The economy has essentially met the employment portion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective . This outcome suggests that our goal-focused , outlook-dependent approach to scaling back accommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well . This same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and years ahead . With that in mind , our policy aims to support continued growth of the American economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives . We do that , as I have noted , with an eye always on the risks . To that end , we realize that waiting too long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime down the road , which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession . Having said that , I currently see no evidence that the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve , and I therefore continue to have confidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate . However , as I have noted , unless unanticipated developments adversely affect the economic outlook , the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was during the past couple of years .",

		"paragraph": "After Australia introduced plain-packaging laws for cigarettes back in 2012 , some big tobacco-producing countries called foul . Cuba , Indonesia , Honduras and Dominican Republican complained to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) about the move , claiming that Australia was breaking international agreements on free trade and intellectual property rights . On Thursday , the WTO delivered a lengthy report on the matter , dismissing the countries claims . So Australia is free to continue selling cigarettes in drab , olive-colored packaging without no branding beyond the manufacturer s name in small print , and with large and graphic health warnings dominating the packaging . The move will likely have major ramifications around the world . Several countries have already followed Australia s lead France , the U.K. , Ireland , Hungary , Norway and New Zealand and more are set to follow . And the knock-on effects could extend beyond tobacco to other harmful foodstuffs , such as junk food and alcohol . The ruling clears another legal hurdle thrown up in the tobacco industry s efforts to block tobacco control and is likely to accelerate implementation of plain packaging around the globe , the World Health Organization said in a statement . According to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Honduras has said it will appeal the decision , claiming that the WTO made legal and factual errors in its decision . Australia is ready to continue fighting for its law , though . We will not shy away from the right to protect the health of Australians , said trade and rural health ministers Steven Ciobo and Bridget McKenzie in a statement quoted by the BBC . But does plain packaging do what it s supposed to ? Studies suggest it does the introduction of plain packaging in Australia increased the numbers of smokers trying to kick the habit .",

		"paragraph": "Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno has a thing that he likes to say about being on the sidelines at a time when , to put it mildly , late night hosts have a lot of material to work into their monologues . Ahem . I did late night TV when Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb , and it was just easier . Now it s all â€¦ it s just kind of nasty out there now , he tells Yahoo Entertainment in a variation of what he s said to others about departing the iconic show in 2014 . I m sort of glad I m out of it . So , no , I have no regrets at all . I lived in the time that I lived in and that was a great time to do it . Now I ll let the younger guys take over . While those younger guys follow the goings-on of President Trump , Twitter , and the rest of the world , Leno , who turns 68 on April 28 , is focused on cars . He now hosts Jay Leno s Garage on CNBC , which showcases his collection of more than 100 cars and motorcycles . On Saturday , the comedian will spend part of his birthday kicking off the Hot Wheels Legends Tour , marking 50 years since the cars were first sold , at Mattel headquarters in El Segundo , Calif . Hot Wheels will host additional family-friendly events at 14 Walmart stores across the country , from Bentonville , Ark. , to Teterboro , N.J. , where people can bring their own life-size vehicles for a chance to get it made into a Hot Wheels toy or simply to ogle . It does n t have to be a fancy Lamborghini or Ferrari . We just want regular people s cars that they ve modified in some way paint job , body work , engine , anything that makes it interesting or different , Leno says . Anything that they think might make it a Hot Wheels car . And there s no admission it s all free . Leno recalls that he first fell in love with cars as a teenager in Massachusetts . You know , when I was 14 , my dad helped me buy a 34 Ford pickup truck that did n t run , Leno says . And we dragged it back home , and I worked on it for two years , until I got my license , and I was able to drive it . Leno still appreciates what it feels like to get a car running . It gives you a sense of accomplishment , he says . Netflix is OK , but you ca n t watch it all day long . You have to do something . It s fun to fix things , and there s a great deal of satisfaction in it . Over the years , Leno has taken pleasure in assembling a fleet of vehicles , featuring everything from a rare McLaren F1 to a 1931 Duesenberg Model J Town Car once owned by the Levi Strauss family , many of them that he restored himself . Some of them have dramatically increased in value since he acquired them . For instance , CNN reported that the McLaren F1 , which Leno bought for $ 800,000 , was worth $ 12 million in October 2016 . I have three criteria for buying cars , Leno explains . It should be attractive to look at , it should be fun to drive , and it should be of technical or historical importance . Because if it has all three of those elements , and if I like it , then probably other people will like it too . And that s kind of the fun part of it , ya know . I do n t buy them to sell them . I buy them cause I like em . The fact that they happen to go up in value , that s just a plus . Leno who points out that he s still on the air but is no longer tied to a nightly show says these days he travels 210 days a year for standup performances . His cars are no help with that , since much of the time he has back-to-back gigs in locations that are far apart . One day he s in Detroit and the next he s in Orlando , he says , but he often drives to shows in San Diego or Palm Springs , Calif. , which are close to his L.A. home . When that happens , he enjoys the ride , sure , but the car is really the point anytime Leno is behind the wheel . What I m driving is way more important than where I m going , he says .

		"paragraph": "Colleges across the country are issuing strict dress codes for Halloween : No sombreros , geisha outfits , or Pocahontas costumes . The spate of guidelines aims to stop cultural appropriation , which runs rampant during the Halloween season and seems to get worse each year . This week , in fact , a website called Halloween Costumes yanked an Anne Frank children s costume consisting of a blue WWII-style dress with the caption , Now your child can play the role of a World War II hero with this girls World War II costume and We can always learn from the struggles of history after social media outcry . Some examples , as outlined by The College Fix : St. Thomas University in Minnesota distributed a flier outlining unacceptable costumes that included , Wearing Native American headdresses , dressing up as a â€˜ Mexican by wearing a sombrero , dressing as a â€˜ geisha , any form of blackface . On Sunday , Princeton University in New Jersey is holding a seminar to engage in a dialogue about the impact of cultural appropriation , Halloween , and why culture is not a costume . At the University of Utah , a newsletter from the Student Affairs Diversity Council outlined tips for avoiding offenses , while name-checking Kylie Jenner as a example of what not to do : Think to yourself : Does the actual name on the costume packaging say â€˜ tribal , or â€˜ traditional ? Does the costume include race-related hair or accessories ( dreads/locs , afros , cornrows , a headdress ) ? Does the costume play into racial stereotypes ? Does this costume represent a culture that is not my own ? If you answered yes to any of these questions , you should rethink the costume and try again . And 1870 , Ohio State University s student-run magazine , published a flow chart titled Is your costume racist ? with questions such as Does it validate white supremacists ? Does it poke fun at a recent national or international tragedy ? And , Does it humanize inhumane people ? The above universities did not return Yahoo Lifestyle s request for comment . However , earlier this month , Neal Lester , an English professor at Arizona State University who runs a yearly symposium on cultural appropriation , told UpRoxx , Cultural appropriation is taking and reducing a particular culture , even if you do think you appreciate it , to something that s entertainment or mockery or â€˜ cool or something to be worn as a fashion . Explaining how dreadlocks are often sold at Halloween stores , Lester added , The issue is why is it being done ? If , for example , there are folks who are not being hired for jobs or people who are being fired from their jobs because of dreadlocks , cornrows or other more Afrocentric hairstyles , then you have to look at why you feel like that is something you need to appropriate . He also draws a line between appropriation and appreciation , telling UpRoxx , You can appreciate another s culture without trying to be it or imitate it . Whenever you see someone s culture and you decide you want to perform it , that s when it becomes a problem . That has nothing to do with whether you appreciate it .

		"paragraph": "General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) said that it sold 3,483 Chevrolet Bolt EVs in the U.S. in the second quarter . That 's a decline of 22.6 % from the same period last year . More to the point , that was n't enough for the little Chevy to retain its bragging rights as the best-selling battery-electric vehicle in the U.S. not made by Tesla ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) . The Bolt was handily outsold in the U.S. in the second quarter by Nissan 's ( NASDAQOTH : NSANY ) new-and-much-improved Leaf . After just a year and a half on the market , has the Bolt run its course ? Is it doomed to fade as Tesla finally ramps up production of its compact Model 3 sedan ? Not quite . Let 's take a closer look at the Bolt 's sales history . U.S. sales of the Chevrolet Bolt EV are down sharply from last fall 's levels . But the reason is n't what you might think . Image source : General Motors . The Bolt 's U.S. sales have followed a curious pattern . They ramped up sharply through 2017 , as you 'd expect -- then dropped dramatically from December to January . As you can see , they 've stayed near that much-lower level since . Data sources : General Motors , InsideEVs . Monthly figures for April , May , and June 2018 are InsideEVs estimates , as GM now reports U.S. sales quarterly rather than monthly . Added together , the estimates match the second-quarter total reported by GM on July 2 . Is this just about the ramped-up competition from Nissan and Tesla ? That 's the easy answer , especially if you 're a Tesla fan . But it 's probably not the right answer , or at least not a complete answer . With U.S. sales down , you 'd expect Bolts to be piling up at dealers . But that 's not happening . On the contrary : Supplies have been somewhat tight for months . Managing the supply of vehicles on dealers ' lots ( called \" inventory \" ) is a tricky science . Dealers like to have enough cars on lots to offer buyers a selection of colors and options . But if they have too many , they may have to discount them to sell them all . Dealer inventories of vehicles are expressed in terms of \" days ' supply . \" For a model like the Bolt , somewhere between 65 and 75 days ' worth is probably ideal -- or just over the \" 60 \" line in the chart below . Data source : Automotive News . Chart shows days ' supply of Chevrolet Bolts at U.S. dealers as of the first day of each month from July 2017 through June 2018 . GM had lots of Bolts in inventory last July , as the car 's national rollout was getting underway . But since then , if anything , supplies have been tight -- very tight in late 2017 and early 2018 . The thing to know is that all Bolts ( and the similar Ampera-e version ) are made in a single factory , in Orion Township , Michigan . It 's believed that factory is set up to make around 30,000 Bolts a year -- or roughly 2,500 a month , on average . Given that U.S. sales of the Bolt broke 2,500 in the last four months of 2017 , the low inventories at year-end are n't really a surprise . But there 's more to the story now . The press release that accompanied GM 's second-quarter sales results included an interesting statement from U.S. sales chief Kurt McNeil : GM plans to increase production of the Bolt starting in the fourth quarter , because global demand has exceeded supply : \" Demand for the Chevrolet Bolt EV , especially in the United States , Canada , and South Korea , has outstripped production [ emphasis added ] . The extra production coming on line should be enough to help us keep growing global Bolt EV sales , rebuild our U.S. dealer inventory , and bring us another step closer to our vision of a world with zero emissions . \" Translation : While U.S. inventories of the Bolt have recovered to a reasonable level , global supplies of the Bolt remain tight . GM has n't talked a lot about it before this week , but the company has been exporting Bolts to other markets , notably Canada and South Korea , as McNeil said . GM is also building the slightly modified version of the Bolt , the Ampera-e , for its former Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe . ( GM sold Opel and Vauxhall to Peugeot last year . ) When you consider that the Bolts that GM sold in Korea in May and June were probably made in the U.S. a few months earlier , the dip in U.S. sales early in 2018 starts to make sense . Adding those sales to our chart answers a lot of questions , especially when you consider that it probably takes several weeks for Bolts to go from Michigan to South Korea . Data sources : General Motors ( U.S. and South Korea ) , InsideEVs ( U.S. monthly estimates for April , May , and June of 2018 ) , Automotive News ( Canada ) , and CarSalesBase com ( Opel and Vauxhall ) . June 2018 figures for Canada and the Ampera-e were not available at press time the figures included in the chart for June are the average of the prior three months ' sales for those two categories . GM said that total global sales for the Bolt were up more than 35 % in the second quarter , versus the second quarter of 2017 , and that total sales were up more than 40 % in the first half of 2018 versus the first half of 2017 . Our chart might not be capturing all the markets in which GM is selling the Bolt , but the data we have suggests that if anything , GM is understating the Bolt 's sales growth somewhat . There 's one more factor that might be impacting Bolt supply in a small way now , but it will almost certainly become a bigger deal next year . GM Cruise , the company 's self-driving subsidiary , has developed a self-driving vehicle based on the Bolt . It 's not in full production yet , and wo n't be until sometime in 2019 . But there are hundreds of them operating in test fleets now , all made in that same Michigan factory . It 's easy to assume that Bolt sales are suffering because of competition . That might be true to some extent . But it 's also true that supplies of the little electric Chevy have been tight , thanks to demand outside the United States . The takeaway : U.S. sales of the Bolt may be down , but from GM 's global perspective , it is doing just fine . More From The Motley Fool John Rosevear owns shares of General Motors .

		"paragraph": "The Miami Heat suffered a potential blow to their playoff chances on Thursday , when star guard Dwyane Wade announced his latest hamstring injury will prevent him from playing for the foreseeable future . At an impromptu press conference called a day before the Heat host the Dallas Mavericks on national TV , Wade told The Miami Herald 's Joseph Goodman and others that the right hamstring he pulled against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday will keep him out of the lineup for a minimum of 2-3 weeks . Even after losing LeBron James to the Cleveland Cavaliers over the summer , the Heat were expected to comfortably settle into a middling playoff seed this season , but instead they find themselves having to hold off a handful of teams within five games of their current seventh-seed status in a dismal Eastern Conference . Three weeks leaves Wade on the bench for a span of just eight games between now and Feb. 20 thanks to an eight-day layoff for the All-Star Game , which the former Finals MVP would be forced to miss should he be named a reserve and that still gives Miami plenty of time to circle the wagons . Plus , games against the Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks ( twice ) in that time span should help them stem the tide . Still , the Heat have to be weary of that three-week timeline , since this latest ailment marks the third leg injury Wade has suffered this year , including a right hamstring pull that cost him seven games in November . And that does n't include knee ailments that have plagued him since winning his first title nearly a decade ago . The Heat ( 20-25 ) are currently 15-20 in Wade 's 35 appearances this season and 5-5 in his absence , but that number 's a bit skewed by injuries to Chris Bosh , Chris Andersen and Josh McRoberts , among others . In fact , only point guard Mario Chalmers has appeared in all 45 games for Miami in 2014-15 . At full strength , the Heat are still a dangerous playoff team , particularly since Hassan Whiteside 's emergence , so for the sake of the sport and an Eastern Conference void of exciting first-round matchups here 's to a speedy recovery for Wade , one of the game 's greats at picking himself up off the mat . - - - - - - - Ben Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Do n't Lie and Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports .

Eleanor Cori Curry is an attorney for small businesses and a single mother of two who believes in doing it all at the most attainable level possible . Immediately following her first career and the births of her children , Curry returned to law school , where she faced her first challenge of trying to balance it all . And with the simple understanding that adulting should n t be that horrible , she started writing a blog called the Play Hard Playbook . It started off just kind of explaining to people how I look at how to balance it , which is kind of being all in , in whatever you re doing , Curry explains to Yahoo Lifestyle . It s about how to build a life where you are responsible , and you re pursuing your dreams as far as your career , but you re also pursuing your dreams as far as who you are as a person what you want to do and what you love . I do n t know if it s doing it all , but are you checking the things off at the top of your list ? For Curry , the things at the top of her list are , of course , her children and her job , in addition to traveling and spending time with the friends who empower and inspire her six of whom she invited on a trip to Los Angeles for a totally boss photoshoot . I had the idea of a photoshoot , and we just bounced some ideas around and found a photographer , Curry says . To me , these women are all like queens , and it s important for us to remind ourselves . All of the women featured are single ( Curry is the only one with children ) , which she highlights as an important reason for self-love . If you do n t remind yourself that you re a queen or you re brilliant , who s going to do it ? she says . There s no one just at home in the pocket waiting to say , â€˜ You look beautiful today . A lot of times , we get so caught up in what we think beauty is , and you have to be this size , or look this way . So you just forget to say , â€˜ I can only look the best I can look , and I should celebrate that , too . ' From the response to the photos she posted , it s evident that many people agree that these women are all beautiful . However , as Curry insists , the power of their accomplishments far outweighs their looks . The group includes five attorneys , one medical researcher , and an accountant , a breakdown that Curry believes is important to point out . I mean , the pictures look glamorous , but people who know me in everyday life know I usually just get dressed in five minutes , just like everybody else , Curry says . It s just a reminder that you can be everything you want to be if you invest the time first in yourself . From there , she believes you can put the most into the rest of the things that mean the most to you . As long as you foster self-love . Everybody s got their own little glow , she says .

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON European lawmakers say President Donald Trump s stunning news conference on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to other countries with democratic political systems similarly targeted for interference by Moscow that they can not count on the U.S. to stand with them . To deny evidence [ of Russia s meddling in the U.S. ] is effectively to say to other countries who are victims [ of ] this ... â€˜ You re on your own , Damian Collins , a Conservative Party MP in the United Kingdom , said at an election security event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington . During Trump s news conference with Putin in Helsinki , Trump refused to confront Putin over Russia s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to even directly acknowledge it occurred , despite the repeated findings of his own administration s intelligence officials . Trump also told reporters that both countries were responsible for the poor state of their relations . I think we ve all been foolish . I think we re all to blame , Trump said , with Putin standing to his side . His comments drew widespread , bipartisan condemnations in the U.S. , with several critics calling them disgraceful . John Brennan , the CIA director under President Barack Obama , gained wide attention for condemning Trump s remarks as nothing short of treasonous . Among Republicans , Sen. John McCain of Arizona issued one of the harshest statements , saying , No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant . Oj rs Kalni , a diplomat and former Latvian ambassador to the U.S who spoke at the Atlantic Council event , panned Trump s remarks as ridiculous . Referring to aggressive Russian actions that draw widespread denunciation from the West , Kalni told HuffPost , If you re talking about ... the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine , the U.S and Europe are not to blame for that at all . That was a unilateral action by Russia . European countries have long battled Russian meddling in their internal affairs . Earlier this year , Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report detailing Russian interference in 19 countries , including providing support for a far-right party in France s last presidential election and mounting a disinformation campaign during Germany s parliamentary elections . Hannah Hopko , a legislator from Ukraine , said that folowing the Trump-Putin summit , it was necessary for the U.S. to establish a firm position that recognizing Russia s annexation of Crimea is not on the table . No compromises , Hopko said at the Atlantic Council event . Trump s meeting with Putin followed combative comments he made at a tumultuous NATO summit last week in Brussels and massive protests against the president in the U.K. over the weekend . He has been intensifying his criticism of longstanding U.S. allies , going so far in a CBS News interview to categorize the European Union as a foe . It s a very difficult time for Europe right now , Kalni said . All of this is playing into the hands of Mr. Putin , who wants to weaken Europe because the way he can make Russia great is by making everyone else weaker . ",

		"paragraph": "Washington ( AFP ) - President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to send the military to close the US-Mexican border against an \" onslaught \" of migrants , stepping up his anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of congressional elections . As several thousand Hondurans made their way through Central America toward the US border , Trump blamed Democrats for an \" assault on our country by Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador \" with a caravan \" INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS . \" \" I must , in the strongest of terms , ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ! \" Trump has made his call for a wall on the southern border a signature issue of his two-year presidency , but Thursday 's tweet storm was especially fierce . Trump suggested he was even prepared to put at risk the recently renegotiated North America Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) between Mexico , the United States and Canada , redubbed as USMCA . \" The assault on our country at our Southern Border , including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in , is far more important to me , as President , than Trade or the USMCA , \" he said . White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders meanwhile said that \" we are passionate about solving the issue of illegal immigration , \" and that \" our administration is doing a great job on the border . \" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo embarked on a tour of the region that took him to Panama on Thursday with a visit to Mexico set for Friday . The Mexican stop is important for future relations because it comes just ahead of the inauguration in December of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador . Marcelo Ebrard , Mexico 's foreign minister designate , downplayed Trump 's comments as aimed at his domestic political base . \" The position of President Trump is the one he has always raised , \" Ebrard told local radio station Radio Centro . \" It was predictable and also the election process is very close , so he is making a political calculation , \" he added . - Controversial caravan - The president 's message was part of a broad strategy to crack down on unauthorized immigrants and tighten rules for legal migrants . Barely a week goes by without Trump warning about the danger posed by ultra-violent Central American gangs like MS-13 , while chants of \" build the wall \" are a staple of his pre-midterms campaign rallies . The latest focus is on some 2,000 Hondurans who departed Saturday from the city of San Pedro Sula in a caravan headed for the US border . A first group of several hundred Honduran migrants arrived late Wednesday on the Guatemalan-Mexican border , where they overflowed a shelter in the town of Tecun Uman , leaving many to sleep in the town square or on the street , an AFP correspondent said . Many were traveling with a single change of clothes and little money . Others were carrying young children in their arms . Several migrants told AFP the group plans to wait for the rest of the caravan to arrive , then cross the border en masse in hopes of overwhelming the Mexican immigration authorities , who have vowed to detain anyone without papers . The migrants say they organized on social media for the long and difficult journey , but Washington suspects the group has been organized as a deliberate provocation . \" This caravan did not appear organically , \" a senior Trump administration official told journalists . \" There 's a political aspect and an organizational aspect which frankly seeks to sow chaos and dissent and that needs to be dealt with , \" the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . - Border forces - In Mexico , hundreds of riot police deployed at a bridge on the border with Guatemala . Guatemala also sent police reinforcements . Responding to a tweet about Mexico deploying police equipped with anti-riot gear , Trump wrote : \" Thank you Mexico , we look forward to working with you ! \" Mexico 's ambassador to Guatemala , Luis Manuel Lopez Moreno , met with migrants camped out in the border town of Tecun Uman to discourage them from crossing illegally . \" We are offering documented entry to those who have a passport and visa , and to those who do not , documented entry via an application for refugee status , on humanitarian grounds . We will address every case , \" he told a large crowd of Hondurans gathered on the town 's central square . Mexico 's foreign minister Luis Videgaray meanwhile told reporters he had met with UN chief Antonio Guterres , who said the UNHCR would help the Mexican government to process asylum applications for those in the caravan . As for the US border , it remained unclear whether Trump 's threat would result in any military deployment . The president announced plans in April to send thousands of National Guard troops to the border , where they could remain until his promised wall is constructed . But at least five US states later refused to send the troops amid an outcry over a since-abandoned White House policy to separate migrant children from their parents at the border .",

Rose Marie was Emmy nominated three times for her work on The Dick Van Dyke Show , in which she played part of the writing team , led by Van Dyke s Rob Petrie , for the fictional Alan Brady Show . The actress began a five-season stint as Sally Rogers in 1960 , but decades earlier , she had been a child singing star under the name Baby Rose Marie . She began her career at 3 , starring in her own show on NBC radio by the age of 5 , cutting records and appearing in vaudeville , in shorts including 1929 s Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder and in Paramount s 1933 feature International House with W.C. Fields . Variety founder Sime Silverman himself mentioned Rose Marie in its pages for The Child Wonder , writing , Though but a kidlet , she seemed to have an idea of her own . Later , as a teenager , she became a nightclub singer before returning to radio as a comedienne . In the early 1950s Rose Marie appeared on television variety shows as a singer and dancer , and she returned to the bigscreen in 1954 , starring opposite Phil Silvers in Top Banana , an adaptation of Silvers Broadway show about a TV comedian .

After The Dick Van Dyke Show she guested on a variety of TV shows , including The Monkees and My Three Sons , and she recurred on The Doris Day Show . During the 1960s she also appeared onstage in Bye Bye Birdie and in a pair of features , starring opposite her Van Dyke co-star Morey Amsterdam in Do n t Worry , We ll Think of a Title , and appearing in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round , starring James Coburn . Rose Marie made a steady stream of TV appearances from the early 1970s until the early 2000s , appearing , for example , on Adam-12 and Kojak recurring as Hilda the sandwich delivery lady on S.W.A.T. appearing repeatedly in different roles on The Love Boat guesting on Cagney and Lacey and Murphy Brown appearing as a series regular on the brief 1994 sports comedy Hardball and guesting on Caroline in the City ( with Amsterdam ) , Wings and Suddenly , Susan .

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Why do it ? Nike has touched off a furor by wading into football 's national anthem debate with an ad featuring Colin Kaepernick , the former 49ers quarterback who was the first athlete to kneel during '' The Star-Spangled Banner '' to protest police brutality against blacks and has n't played a game since 2016 . The ad copy reads : '' Believe in something , even if it means sacrificing everything . '' The ad , part of Nike 's 30th anniversary '' Just Do it '' campaign , has outraged many . Online , people threatened boycotts and posted videos and photos of shoes set on fire , Nike gear thrown in the trash , and swoosh logos cut out of products . Most big corporations steer clear of politics , and marketing experts disagreed Tuesday over whether the Kaepernick campaign is good business . But some noted approvingly that it made a big splash and set Nike apart . And they said it could solidify Nike 's bond with athletes , especially black ones , an important consideration for a company that relies heavily on sports stars to endorse its products . Brian Gordon , CEO of Engine Shop , a sports and entertainment marketing agency , said the ad is provocative but '' authentic to who they are and the communities they represent and speak to , '' including the athletes . '' Even in the face of potential backlash , they support their athlete partners , and that 's an incredibly powerful statement to the athlete community , '' Gordon said . Other athletes in the campaign include tennis star Serena Williams , New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Shaquem Griffin , a linebacker whose left hand was amputated when he was 4 . But the Kaepernick ad struck a nerve , timed just before the NFL season kicks off on Thursday . Nike did not return a request for comment about its strategy . Its stock closed down more than 3 percent Tuesday . Neil Saunders , managing director of the data and analytics firm GlobalData , called the Kaepernick strategy '' commercially imprudent . '' '' Nike 's campaign will generate both attention and discussion which is , arguably , one of its central aims , '' he said . '' However , it is also a risky strategy in that it addresses , and appears to take sides on , a highly politicized issue . This means it could ultimately alienate and lose customers , which is not the purpose of a marketing campaign . '' But other experts think the strength of Nike 's brand will help it weather the storm and perhaps benefit from it , too . Nike is one of the world 's largest sports apparel companies , with $ 34.5 billion in revenue last year . '' What you stand for is almost as important as what you make , '' said Allen Adamson , co-founder of marketing firm Metaforce . '' It 's a polarized marketplace . No matter what you do , you offend some people . They 're focused on what they stand for , and if that upsets some users , so be it . '' Robert Passikoff , founder of marketing consultancy Brand Keys , said an ad like Nike 's will divide people , but the outrage wo n't last . '' My guess is that the audience that is reacting so badly to this are n't buying a lot of Nikes anyway , '' he said . '' They 'll move on to the next thing . Welcome to the 21st century . '' Nike , based in Beaverton , Oregon , has made waves before . An ad for the company 's sport hijab went viral in 2017 . And a 2010 commercial featuring a voiceover by Tiger Woods ' late father when the golfer was trying to recover from a sex scandal drew mixed reviews . In August , Nike made news when the French Open banned Williams ' Nike-branded black catsuit . Nike responded by posting an image of her on social media with the line '' You can take the superhero out of her costume , but you can never take away her superpowers . '' Brands run the risk of a backlash in taking a political stand in their advertising . Starbucks was mocked in 2015 for trying to start a discussion about race by writing the slogan '' Race Together '' on its cups . Pepsi ended up pulling a commercial that showed Kendall Jenner giving a Pepsi to a police officer some said the ad trivialized the '' Black Lives Matter '' protests . John Sweeney , sports communication professor at the University of North Carolina , said the Kaepernick ad was created to provoke people , and in that respect , it succeeded . '' You may have a negative reaction or a positive reaction , but you have a reaction , '' he said . '' They wanted something that would stop the presses and stop people in their places . '' For some , the ad has made them bigger fans of the brand . '' I think what Nike did was a tremendous step in fighting against the people who misunderstand the protests by Kaep and players , '' said Seth Buchwalter , of Portland , Oregon , a lifelong Nike customer . But Wesley Callaway , of Omaha , Nebraska , said he does n't agree with kneeling during the national anthem and thinks it is unfortunate Nike is featuring Kaepernick , though he said he does n't buy many Nike products and wo n't make any changes in his shopping habits . '' I do n't mind them protesting brutality , '' he said . '' I just wish they would n't do it during the anthem . '' --- AP Business Writer Josh Funk contributed to this report from Omaha , Nebraska . --- This article has been corrected to give the correct title for Allen Adamson . It 's co-founder of marketing firm Metaforce , not BrandSimple marketing consultant .",

		"paragraph": "Under Armour s biggest star athlete , Steph Curry , is headed to the NBA Finals . But that has n t helped buoy the brand . Under Armour ( UA ) stock is down nearly 30 % so far this year . ( In the same time period , Nike is up slightly and Adidas is way up . ) Its CFO Chip Molloy left the company . In its last earnings report at the end of April , the company reported its first ever quarterly loss . More importantly , and more ominous for Under Armour : its footwear sales were up 2 % in Q1 2017 . In Q1 2016 , they rose 64 % . The scrappy Baltimore sportswear brand is having a very bad year . What s the problem ? The basketball sneaker business has been bad for nearly two years now , but it may be reaching a nadir : basketball sneaker sales are down 26 % since the start of 2017 . That s bad for the whole sports footwear industry , so it s not only hurting Under Armour , but it is especially bad for Under Armour , which overemphasized basketball footwear on the back of Steph Curry , its biggest star endorser . Why have basketball sneakers declined ? Simple fashion trends , experts say . For a time , kids would also wear basketball performance sneakers ( performance as in designed for playing basketball ) for fashion purposes , but that has waned as kids gravitate more toward shoes that are designed with fashion in mind ( i.e. running shoes that people wear all day ) . That change in trend is n t Under Armour s fault , but the brand is at fault for focusing too much on one star and one sport . I had expected that at some point the fashion headwinds would catch up to Curry , says NPD Group sneaker analyst Matt Powell . They had a nice run with him , they signed him at the peak of his popularity , but now basketball going out of fashion has hurt them significantly . While basketball has declined the most , it is n t the only sport where performance sneaker sales are down . There is not a single performance category that is trending positively right now , Powell says . Not basketball , not hiking , not gym . We are 100 % in an athletic fashion trend . Here s why that s a crisis for Under Armour : The company was always a performance brand . It sold gear meant to be worn for playing sports . It did not prepare for the athletic fashion explosion a trend you might better know by the term athleisure . It is a term that Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank does not like ( surprise ! ) and a trend that has been debilitating for his brand . Unfortunately for Under Armour , it is faltering just at a time when one of its biggest competitors is flying . Adidas ( ADDYY ) stock is up this year almost as much as Under Armour stock is down , and in the German giant s 2016 end-of-year earnings report it issued stunning guidance for 2017 and beyond . Under Armour , on the other hand , lowered its guidance . Nike ( NKE ) is n t doing so hot either right now in its last earnings report the company missed on revenue expectations but it at least foresaw the trend Under Armour missed . Both Adidas and Nike have already , for years , offered an array of fashion-focused apparel . Under Armour did n t . In Adidas s case , one could argue fashion or street wear was what the company ( which has its roots in track and soccer ) was best known for in America in the 1980s and 1990s . And now those classics are back : the best-performing footwear division at Adidas right now is its Originals , home to designs like the Superstar and Stan Smith . Design collaborations with artists like Pharrell Williams and Kanye West have also helped boost buzz for Adidas , even if it s hard to pin down a precise sales impact , since West s Yeezy shoes are only ever released in small doses . Adidas s performance in 2016 earned it the title of Yahoo Finance Sports Business of the Year , and it is likely to dominate its peers in athletic footwear again in 2017 . The rise of Adidas has eaten into footwear market share for both Nike and Under Armour . While Adidas s U.S. sneaker share has risen to 11.4 % , Under Armour s has shrunk slightly to 2.5 % . Nike , when taking into account Jordan Brand and Converse , still enjoys a lion s share 54.6 % . Under Armour must quickly adapt to compete , or look on from the sidelines . They needed to make the pivot to sportswear much sooner than they did , Powell says . Back in February , in an interview with CNBC , Kevin Plank was asked for his opinion of President Trump . Plank said : I think he is highly passionate . To have such a pro-business president is something that s a real asset for this country . I think people should grab that opportunity . He is still paying the price for those comments today . Under Armour s stock plunged in the days that followed and a slew of its sponsored athletes spoke out to challenge the sentiment , including Curry , Misty Copeland and Dwayne The Rock Johnson . The company walked back Plank s comment in a statement days later , saying , We are against a travel ban and believe that immigration is a source of strength , diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour . But the controversy was damaging . Plank , of course , is n t the only CEO ( and Under Armour is n t the only company ) that has had to walk a tightrope around the Trump administration : the same issue has affected the leaders of tech companies like Uber , Airbnb and Tesla . Certainly the mini-scandal around Plank and Trump is n t Under Armour s biggest problem by any means , but in a year of disappointing financial performance , it did not help . To be sure , there is more pressure on apparel brands to be on-trend than ever before . And trends are changing faster than before , too . 20 years ago , Powell says , fashion trends would last for nearly a decade now they last less than three years . The good news there for Under Armour : basketball shoes will soon come back into fashion . And make no mistake : Under Armour s brand remains strong . Athletes know it , and young kids like it . But to catch up to the athleisure trend , which is not going away , I think we re going to see them add a layer of fashion to everything they do , says Powell . I think we re going to see them do a lot more product that does n t look like it s meant for the gym , but does have performance characteristics . And that s a hard shift to make , but it s not impossible . Every brand has had to do this . Even Nike and Adidas , they were performance brands that kind of looked down their nose at people who bought performance sneakers to wear as fashion , but they changed their approach and won . At some point Under Armour will have to do that . Daniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance . Follow him on Twitter at @readDanwrite .

		"paragraph": "The Vertical Front-Office Insider Bobby Marks , a 20-year executive with the Nets , examines the off-season plans for teams that did n t make the postseason . THE PLAN GOING FORWARD Block out the noise Did success and unrealistic expectations early in the season happen too quickly for a Knicks team that won 17 games in 2014-15 ? People seemed to forget that last year s team resembled a minor-league squad , and management was working from the ground level during free agency . Unfortunately , the NBA is a results-oriented endeavor , and New York will be remembered as a team that hovered around .500 at the end of January but ended the season on a 10-28 slide . Go outside the tree Sometimes stubbornness can lead to failure . If New York wants to succeed in its rebuild , it will need to find a coach and staff outside Phil Jackson s coaching tree . The list of Jackson disciples who have failed is overwhelming : Jim Cleamons , Bill Cartwright , Brian Shaw , Frank Hamblen , Derek Fisher and current Knicks interim head coach Kurt Rambis . Finding the right coach this offseason will be Phil Jackson s biggest move during his tenure leading New York . Take the temperature on Melo If Carmelo Anthony waives his no-trade clause this summer that does not guarantee he ll be traded . Although Anthony still has value around the league , executives feel the package New York would receive would be a watered-down version of the assets New York sent out in 2011 to acquire Anthony . Even with a rising salary cap there are several factors when it comes to evaluating Anthony s value . Anthony , who ll turn 32 in October , is still owed $ 24.5 million , $ 26.2 million and $ 27.9 million ( player option ) over the next three seasons . Anthony would also be owed $ 9 million in a trade bonus if he were traded . New York would pay the trade bonus , but the receiving team would take the salary-cap hit . So for 2016-17 and 2017-18 , the new team would have a cap hit of $ 29 million and $ 31million , large numbers even with a projected $ 92 million salary cap in 2016-17 . There is also is the durability issue . Anthony , who missed half the 2014-15 season with a left knee injury , has not played a full season since his rookie year in Denver . Add a second floor The foundation was set when the Knicks drafted Kristaps Porzingis , Jerian Grant and Willy Hernangomez last June , and the first floor was finished three weeks later with the free-agent signing of Robin Lopez . Now comes the hard part for Knicks management . It must make the pieces work while adding a second floor of talent . The Knicks must continue to get better while also having some roster stability and flexibility . TEAM NEEDS Find the right coach New York needs to find its next head coach before any roster issues are addressed this summer . Once a coach is in place , the philosophy and style of play will dictate the direction the Knicks go . Build a bench Other than Grant and Kyle O Quinn , the bench is bare . New York is in dire need of backups at shooting guard , small forward and power forward . How the Knicks fill out the bench will depend on Afflalo and Derrick Williams , who can each opt out . If both players enter free agency , New York s cap space will increase substantially to address those needs . Identify the right point by being frugal Because of a thin free-agent point-guard market , the wrong approach would be to throw substantial money at a short-term fix . Although the NBA is now a point-guard driven league , New York should n t panic if it strikes out in free agency . Get more athletic at two guard Although there is a glaring need at point guard , the most pressing need for New York is getting more athletic at starting and backup shooting guard . If Arron Afflalo ( player option ) returns , the best solution would be to have him come off the bench and slide to small forward . CAP PICTURE PROJECTED CAP SPACE The Knicks cap situation is fluid because of the options of Afflalo and Williams and free-agent cap holds on Lance Thomas and Langston Galloway . Afflalo and Williams opting out does not open cap space right away . Both players will have a higher free-agent hold , and cap flexibility will only open if either player signs with a new team or is renounced . New York could have as little as $ 12 million in room or as much as $ 35 million , depending on what the Knicks decide . The most realistic option is $ 30 million in room with only Thomas and Galloway as free-agent holds against the cap .

Jenner even discovered a website that looked identical to kyliecosmetics.com . So she decided to take matters into her own hands and her mother , Kris , was not happy about it . While driving to downtown Los Angeles to hunt for the counterfeit products in question , Kylie was on the phone with Kris , who told her , I do n t like the sound of this , I really do n t .

		"paragraph": "Trump ' dossier ' stuck in New York , did n't trigger Russia investigation , sources say originally appeared on abcnews.go.com President Donald Trump and his allies have long insisted that what he calls the fake dirty dossier was wholly responsible for starting the totally and discredited witch hunt by special counsel Robert Mueller . But , beginning in July 2016 , that so-called dossier actually sat for several weeks inside an organized crime unit at the FBI s New York field office , even as counterintelligence agents in Washington , D.C. unaware of the new allegations were already investigating Russian efforts to hijack American democracy . Trump doubled down on his dossier accusation this week , ordering the Justice Department and U.S. intelligence community to release a bigger slice of the classified information used to investigate one of his advisers , New York business consultant Carter Page , insisting again Tuesday that what will be disclosed is that there was no basis for the surveillance . ( MORE : Trump defends order to declassify Russia probe documents , says he wants ' total transparency ' in ' witch hunt ' ) Despite what Trump and like-minded politicians have said , sources told ABC News the dossier was plainly not the initial basis for the federal investigation . The following account , relayed to ABC News by several sources familiar with the federal probe , reflects how the FBI s investigation into contacts between Russian operatives and Trump s campaign team , including Page , was well underway in the summer of 2016 by the time a former British spy handed the FBI a packet of startling and salacious allegations tied to Trump . In fact , the FBI already had an open counterintelligence case on Page when he became a volunteer on Trump s foreign policy team in January 2016 , according to sources familiar with the matter . By then , Trump had publicly claimed to have a good instinct about Russian s ruthless president , Vladimir Putin , had praised how Putin was running his country , and had compared the Kremlin s assassinations of dissidents to the plenty of killing that happens inside the United States . Trump s refusal to criticize Putin even in private mystified then-FBI Director James Comey , he later recalled to ABC News . ( MORE : Comey says Trump asked if he could disprove salacious prostitute allegations in ' dossier ' ) And three years earlier , when the FBI in 2013 was tracking two Russian spies in New York , agents secretly recorded one of the spies saying he wanted to recruit Page as an intelligence source . Page had previously lived in Moscow for three years . Page was never charged with any crimes and says he cooperated with that previous investigation , but sources told ABC News his file , like many counterintelligence files , was never closed . So , two months after Page started advising Trump s campaign , the FBI paid him a visit in New York , asking about contacts with Russian intelligence , according to a government document . At the time , in the spring of 2016 , the U.S. intelligence community had no clue the Russian government was about to launch one of its most sophisticated and effective operations ever against the United States . Russian hackers stole hundreds of thousands of emails from Democratic institutions , and a global battalion of bots armed with fake news was deployed across social media . Under what circumstances is a hack considered an act of war ? a reporter asked the State Department spokesman on June 14 , 2016 , the day the Democratic National Committee revealed its systems had been breached . The government spokesman declined to answer . Three weeks later , Carter Page showed up in Moscow . He was giving the commencement address at the New Economic School , tied to some of the Kremlin s top officials , and the event was being broadcast live online . I am particularly grateful for my relationship with the faculty and staff at the New Economic School , he said at the start of his remarks , insisting he was there as a private citizen . The date was July 7 , 2016 . Page s name would n t first appear in the dossier for another two weeks . The dossier , in fact , was not one single document but a series of 17 separate reports , compiled over six months by former British spy Christopher Steele . Steele was working for someone he knew well in Washington , Glenn Simpson , whose firm , Fusion GPS , was hired by the DNC to conduct opposition research on Trump . By mid-July 2016 , Steele wanted to flag his findings to the U.S. government . He reached out to two old friends : Bruce Ohr , a senior Justice Department official whose wife worked for Fusion GPS and who , like him , closely tracked organized crime , and Jonathan Winer , an aide to then-Secretary of State John Kerry who has since spoken publicly about his contact with Steele . It s unclear if Ohr relayed Steele s reporting to anyone at the time no public evidence suggests Ohr passed it on then . But the State Department s response to Steele was blunt : If you re so concerned , take it to the FBI . So that s what Steele did . In July 2016 , Steele already had a long-term contact in the FBI , and he had a reputation for digging up solid , verifiable information , sources told ABC News . He had been a reliable U.S. government informant , providing the State Department alone with nearly 120 documents about Russian efforts overseas with no connection to Trump . A few years earlier , Steele helped an FBI agent in Rome piece together a massive web of corruption within international soccer . The case against FIFA made international headlines . Trying to take advantage of that relationship in July 2016 , Steele sent the FBI agent in Rome the opposition research on Trump he generated working for Fusion GPS . The Rome-based agent then forwarded the reports to an agent he worked with in the FBI s New York field office an agent with expertise in criminal organizations and organized crime , not counterintelligence , sources told ABC News . That was the wrong person to send the reports to , according to one source briefed on the Russia probe . Steele s research sat for weeks in the FBI s New York field office , hundreds of miles away from the agents in Washington scrutinizing ties between Trump s associates and the Russian government , sources said . It took a long period of time for the New York field office to see it and realize what it was , another source told ABC News , referring to the \" dossier . An account of the FBI investigation released in February by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee reflected the delay . Steele 's reporting did not reach the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters until mid-September 2016 , more than seven weeks after the FBI opened its investigation , because the probe 's existence was so closely held within the FBI , the memo by House Democrats said . By then , the FBI had already opened sub-inquiries into [ multiple ] individuals linked to the Trump campaign , including Carter Page , the memo noted . In particular , the FBI was also already taking a close look at Trump s campaign manager , Paul Manafort . Manafort had spent years working pro-Russia projects in Ukraine , and the FBI actually interviewed him in 2013 and 2014 about those business dealings overseas . Then in September 2016 , the Justice Department s National Security Division sent Manafort a letter notifying him that he was in their crosshairs once again . But what really prompted alarm within the FBI in the summer of 2016 was a tip from an Australian diplomat : Before the DNC hack ever became public , a low-level campaign staffer , George Papadopoulos , told him that the Kremlin had collected dirt on Hillary Clinton , namely thousands of emails . In mid-September 2016 , Peter Strzok , the now former FBI agent who was helping to lead the Russia probe , received an initial batch of Steele s reports . The first time I am aware of the FBI having that information the first time I saw it was in mid-September , he recently told lawmakers under oath . In the days afterward , Comey himself was briefed on Steele s findings , according to Comey s public statements . Steele , meanwhile , was meeting with reporters in Washington , looking to share with them some of what he had already given to the FBI . Steele did not show them copies of his reports , but he shared indications of possible coordination of members of Trump s campaign team and Russian government officials , as Steele would later describe it in British court filings . Within days , news outlets started publishing what Steele told them . And lawmakers on Capitol Hill then pressed Comey on the reports during a hearing on Sept. 28 , 2016 . Comey would n t answer specific questions , saying it would require him to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation . But he offered this : We are doing an awful lot of work through our counterintelligence investigators to understand just what mischief is Russia up to in connection with our election . It s unclear if at that time the FBI was already drafting the application it would file with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to secretly monitor Page s communications . Two sources , however , said it takes weeks to put an application like that together . On Oct. 21 , 2016 , the FBI and Justice Department formally filed their application with the court . It was more than 50 pages long . Based on a heavily redacted version since released by the FBI , five pages covered Page s connections to Russian intelligence services , at least five pages summarized news reports about Page s suspected connections to Russia , and as many as six pages covered information provided by Steele . In particular , the application detailed Steele s allegations that Page met with two of Putin s closest associates while in Moscow two months earlier . Page has denied ever meeting them , and no evidence has publicly surfaced to support that portion of Steele s reporting . However , Page would later acknowledge that while in Moscow , he sent an email to Trump campaign staffers saying he had a private conversation with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich who expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together on current international problems . Nevertheless , with the presidential election less than three weeks away , the FBI did n t take any overt steps to move its investigation along . As Comey later explained to internal investigators , he believed in a take no action rule so close to an election . [ We ] avoid taking any action that could have some impact , even if unknown , on an election , whether that s a dogcatcher election or President of the United States , he told the investigators . While the FBI was holding off on taking any public steps in its investigation , Steele was becoming increasingly anxious about Trump in the late fall of 2016 . He even told Ohr he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected , as Ohr later recalled in notes . But Steele lost his direct line to the FBI in the final days of October 2016 , after the FBI realized he was talking to the press about his findings and his secret relationship with the U.S. government . ( MORE : Republican lawmakers question DOJ official Bruce Ohr on Trump ' dossier ' ) A week before the presidential election , the FBI suspended its relationship with Steele and told him not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI , according to FBI records since released . Steele , however , was sharing his findings with Ohr , who became an avenue for the FBI to continue receiving the information that Steele was gathering . In fact , according to congressional documents , in the month after Trump won the presidency , Ohr met twice with officials from the FBI , including FBI attorney Lisa Page and Strzok , the senior agent working the Russia probe who privately expressed his own misgivings about Trump . Ohr notified other senior colleagues in the Justice Department s Criminal Division about his contacts with Steele , but he did not notify his superiors in the deputy attorney general s office , whom he reported to as associate deputy attorney general , sources with knowledge of the matter told ABC News . In a private interview with lawmakers , Ohr said he did n t inform his bosses because he was simply relaying information from a trusted source and did n t believe he had to do so , according to one source familiar with Ohr s congressional testimony . By Thanksgiving 2016 , it still was not clear to us whether anyone at a high level of government was aware of the information that Chris had gathered and provided to the FBI , Simpson later told congressional investigators . So Steele and Simpson decided they would give Steele s reports to Ohr someone higher up , as Simpson described Ohr . On Dec. 10 , 2016 , Simpson met Ohr at a coffee shop in Washington and handed Ohr at least one thumb drive . Ohr did not look at the contents of the thumb drive , though he suspected it might relate to Steele s work on Trump , Ohr later told congressional investigators , according to a source familiar with the testimony . The day before , the late Sen. John McCain hand-delivered his own copy of Steele s reporting to Comey , according to sources familiar with the exchanges . Separately , Ohr passed his newly-obtained material to the FBI . [ Our FBI colleague ] met with Bruce and got more stuff today , Strzok told Lisa Page in a text message on Dec. 20 , 2016 . Yeah , lots to read , but it all stressed me out too much , the FBI attorney responded . Three weeks later , on Jan. 9 , 2017 , Steele s reports became public when Buzzfeed published them online . Hey let me know when you can talk , Strzok texted Lisa Page on Jan. 10 , 2017 . We re discussing whether , now that this is out , we use it as a pretext to go interview some people . The cat was out of the bag , and the public release of Steele s reports gave the FBI a basis for taking more overt action . Three days after first texting Lisa Page about it , Strzok started contacting people that the FBI identified as sources for Steele s reports . [ W ] e just want to talk to him quietly , Strzok recalled telling an attorney representing one of Steele s sources . It s about the stuff in the news , is n t it ? Strzok quoted the attorney as responding . Indeed , it was . The FBI , meanwhile , was starting to focus on others completely unassociated with Steele s reporting . For the first time , agents approached two key Trump associates for interviews : then-national security adviser Michael Flynn , and George Papadopoulos , the adviser who was told early on that Russia had stolen dirt on Hillary Clinton . In those interviews , later confirmed in their guilty pleas , Flynn lied about his contacts with Russian officials , and Papadopoulos lied about his own interactions with individuals tied to the Kremlin . Those false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the [ Trump ] Campaign and Russia s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election , Flynn and Papadopoulos would each later admit in court . Around the same time , the FBI submitted another application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , asking a federal judge for permission to continue monitoring Carter Page s communications . The application noted that the FBI had suspended its relationship with Steele , but said his information was still deemed reliable as previous reporting from [ him ] has been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings . The FBI s latest submission was 66 pages long nearly 16 pages longer than the initial application . Meanwhile , FBI officials continued to meet with Ohr speaking with him at least eight more times in the months after Trump s inauguration , including twice after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 and took over the broader investigation , according to congressional documents . In June 2017 , a month after Mueller s appointment , the FBI filed yet another application with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to continue tracking Carter Page . The application was 77 pages long . A fourth and final application was filed three months later . Heavily-redacted versions of the applications were released in July . On Monday , Trump ordered that more portions of the application from June 2017 be released . It s unclear why Trump did not order the release of sections from the other applications , but the first application in October 2016 was based on information Steele provided himself , not information provided by Ohr , according to congressional investigators and public evidence presented so far . Trump also ordered the release of the FBI s notes from Ohr s meetings with the agency about what Steele was telling him . The Justice Department and Director of National Intelligence are now undertaking a review of the documents covered by Trump 's order and could request redactions . Trump s move to release more classified information came just days after several Republican House members held a press conference calling on him to declassify the documents , with Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , saying it s time for the FBI and Justice Department to come clean about the wrongdoing that took place . But Democrats swiftly condemned what they called Trump s clear abuse of power . \" [ He ] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , said in a statement on Monday . Trump s order came three days after Manafort in a case with no link to Steele s reporting pleaded guilty to financial-related crimes and agreed to cooperate with Mueller s office . President Trump s actions â€¦ are a direct and frantic response to the dramatic events that unfolded last Friday , the top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees -- Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , D-Md . said in a statement on Monday . Having previously pleaded guilty to lying to authorities , Papadopoulos was recently sentenced to two weeks behind bars . His case also was not connected to Steele s reporting . Flynn , who also pleaded guilty to lying to authorities and agreed to cooperate with Mueller , is expected to be sentenced in the coming weeks another case not tied to Steele s reporting . The broader federal probe , meanwhile , continues . The FBI declined to comment for this article .",

		"paragraph": "Updated : 8 p.m. The Eagles are n't going to the White House after all . They 've been disinvited . Less than 24 hours before the Super Bowl champions were set to visit the White House for a glorified photo opportunity , President Donald Trump has rescinded their invitation with the following statement : \" The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow . They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem , hand on heart , in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country . \" The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation , but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better . These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony - one that will honor our great country , pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it , and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem . I will be there at 3:00 p.m. with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus to celebrate America . \" In the planning leading up to the trip , several notable Eagles , including Malcolm Jenkins , Chris Long and Brandon Graham , said they were not going to attend the White House visit . The team was planning on letting its individual players decide whether or not they wanted to attend the visit to the White House , which was supposed to be just a part of its trip to Washington D.C . The Eagles were presumably planning other parts to their trip . At least some of the team was looking forward to visiting the White House . \" I 'm excited to be going to be honored as world champions . It 's a great honor , \" head coach Doug Pederson said on May 17 . \" We 're still working through some logistics right now , so we do n't have all the details today , but excited to be going . \" Jenkins , even though he did n't want to go to the White House , said he did n't want to ruin the experience for others . Among them was seemingly quarterback Carson Wentz , who said he would attend if his other teammates wanted to go . \" I think it 's just a cool way to receive the honor nationally and be recognized , \" Wentz said on May 22 . \" I do n't personally view it - I know some people do and everyone has their opinion on it - but I do n't view it as a political thing whatsoever . I do n't mess with politics very often . \" Eagles owner Jeff Lurie is considered one of the more liberal owners in the NFL . He gave money to Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign and reportedly called Trump 's presidency \" disastrous \" in a closed-door meeting . When asked about the possibility of a White House visit back at the owners meetings in March , Lurie did n't want to talk about it . The first time the Eagles acknowledged the visit to the White House was in April , when they said they were working through the logistics of a trip to Washington , where they were hoping for an \" opportunity to engage in productive dialogue with the leaders of our country . \" Swirling at the forefront of this rescinded invitation is the president 's strong stance against demonstrations during the national anthem . In fact , that 's precisely the reason for the rescinded invitation . Jenkins has been one of the most outspoken anthem demonstrators - he raised his fist - but stopped his demonstration last year when the NFL and his players coalition helped create an agreement that pledged $ 90 million toward social justice issues . But earlier this offseason , the NFL passed a new rule that aimed to eliminate protests during the anthem entirely and backlash has followed . The Eagles have not yet responded to a request for comment .",

To quote Season 2 s Dash Goff , the Writer , they were sweet-smelling , coy , cunning , voluptuous , voracious , delicious , pernicious , vexing and sexing , these earth sister rebel mothers , these arousers and carousers â€¦ Or , to put it slightly less eloquently , they were smart , opinionated , man-loving feminists who defied the stereotypes of women and Southerners on TV . To celebrate the show s 30th anniversary , Yahoo TV looks back at Designing Women â€˜ s first five seasons through interviews with Bloodworth-Thomason , Burke , Potts , and Smart . They also share fond memories of Carter , who passed away in 2010 , and Meshach Taylor , who joined the series in Season 1 as delivery man Anthony Bouvier and died in 2014 . Part I : The Pitch In 1986 , Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , from Poplar Bluff , Mo. , had already made a name for herself in Hollywood having earned an Emmy nomination for co-writing an episode of M * A * S * H. She d also created two short-lived series Filthy Rich ( 1982-83 ) , a spoof of nighttime soaps starring Delta Burke and Dixie Carter , and Lime Street ( 1985-86 ) , a Robert Wagner-led drama in which Jean Smart and Annie Potts had guest-starred as sisters who were international jewel thieves . Linda Bloodworth-Thomason : I had a deal with CBS to create a show for an actor that they wanted to see on the air . By now I d been involved in enough preliminary pilot-making to know if they like someone , you should probably do that show , but I was just sitting in my office looking out the window thinking , This just really is n t me . And this actor is n t anyone I m really interested in . I wanted to write something that had a lot of estrogen . And fortunately , because of this brilliant casting director who was my dear friend , Fran Bascom she d found Jean and Annie for Lime Street , and she also had brought me Dixie and Delta for Filthy Rich I started thinking about the four of them now , and how much I had liked Dixie and Delta together , and how much I had liked Jean and Annie together , and Would n t it be so great if I could do a show with all four of them ? So I just called CBS on a lark . I did n t even have an idea for them , really . I just said , Look , I ve got these four actresses , I really would love to write something for them . I would really much rather do that than this show that you re thinking of doing . They said , Well , how soon can you come over here ? I said , Right now . I got in my car and drove there . â€¦ I told Mike Ogiens , [ CBS s VP of comedy development ] , Look , I do n t care what they do for a living , I just want these four women all together in the same room all talking . That s all I know . And Mike said , I want to do this show . I can see it . And then he called Harvey Shephard , who was [ CBS s senior vice president for programming ] , and Harvey came down . By then , CBS knew my writing and they knew each of these actresses individually . Harvey said , So you re gon na get these four women â€¦ and you re gon na basically write what they say ? And I said , Yeah . And he said , We re gon na shoot that show . And then he left . Oh , the only other thing he said was , What s the name of it ? And somebody said , Well , how about [ they play ] decorators ? And then somebody else said , Designing Women . And that was it . It might be the easiest sale in network history for somebody who s not had a successful show before . There was one hiccup : When it was time to formally cast the pilot , the network did n t want Burke , a former Miss Florida who d already starred as an ex-beauty queen in one series with Carter , as Suzanne . They wanted Lorna Patterson , the Airplane ! actress who d played the lead role in the TV adaptation of Private Benjamin . Bloodworth-Thomason : They were really pushing another actress , and I did n t want that other actress . It was n t that she was terrible it was that the part was written for Delta . It was very close to shooting , a few days before , and they came and saw that the part was not written for Lorna . I said , Please , please , let me call Delta . What do you have to lose ? Let her just try . Delta Burke : I m in my apartment , crying my eyes out and saying , This was written for me . This is my part . Then I got a call that I had a chance at it , and I had to come in and audition . So I went in and auditioned . They did n t want me to have a Southern accent , for some reason . I m trying really hard not to have a Southern accent , and they went for me . They said , OK . You can cast her . Then we re shooting the pilot , and I thought I was talking without a Southern accent , but years later , I saw the pilot at the Museum of Television & Radio â€¦ and there I was with a Southern accent . I thought I had hidden it , but I had not . Annie Potts : Once she came in , it all fell into place , really , because everything was in balance then . Burke : Dixie was already like my sister . That bond was there . Whenever we would have scenes to do , it was n t Julia and Suzanne doing the scene , it was Dixie and Delta doing the scene . I groveled at her feet . I thought she was so talented . I wanted to grow up to be just like her . Potts : I had not [ met Dixie before Designing Women ] . It was love at first sight . I thought she was just devastatingly gorgeous and funny and sexy , and she was married to someone very famous [ Hal Holbrook ] , and I was just completely bedazzled by her and remained so for the rest of our time together . Jean Smart : I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on Dixie Carter . I went to an off-Broadway show and it was a show called A Couple of White Chicks Sitting Around Talking . This woman makes an entrance . She came out on that stage like she was a thoroughbred pony or something in her high heels and her hair . I just thought , Who is that ? The most gorgeous creature I had ever seen . Several years later when I got to work with her , I was thrilled . Burke : We all liked each other immediately , so there was this friendship going on right from the beginning , but we just clicked with our work right away and we would feed off each other . You d get excited about what somebody else did that was really funny that you liked , and you d go , Oh , do that ! You re really funny when you do that ! We d encourage each other in that way . I knew at the time that it was very unique situation because you do n t get that kind of atmosphere , those kind of characters to play , and these kind of actors to work with . It just does n t come along . Part II : The Voice The plot of the pilot revolved around Suzanne s hitting it off romantically with Mary Jo s ex Ted ( Scott Bakula ) , the cheating gynecologist Mary Jo had put through medical school while raising their children . Potts : They had let me be in on the casting session for Ted . I felt that [ Scott Bakula ] was by far the best , and I requested him because I think also sometimes , when somebody is so likable and you have to hate them , it makes it hard and that s funny . Bloodworth-Thomason : I wanted the women to get into an argument , and I thought , There s no better argument than over a man . But because women are so often trivialized with fighting over men , I wanted to take this very stereotypical situation and try to elevate it to show that even in their discussion of the problem , the conversation can be elevated . Like on Real Housewives , it s just a lot of fighting and slapping each other and pulling each other s wigs off we did n t want to do that . I wanted to show that through humor and camaraderie they could triumph over that , and that at the end of the show , the four of them are much more important than any relationship with a man . The pilot also featured Julia s first legendary monologue , a scathing assessment of a man named Ray Don ( guest star Arlen Dean Snyder ) , who insisted on joining her , Charlene , and Mary Jo at their table . Potts : You know there s gay bars that run her speeches on a continual loop . People know all the speeches by heart . Dixie suffered over every one of them because they were always lengthy and fabulous and she had a sensational work ethic and she wanted them to be just right . She worked them and worked them and worked them . Smart : No one wrote speeches in sitcoms back then . You d have a line or two , and someone else would have a line or two and a punchline , and then you d have a line or two and a punchline , and they d have a line , and you d have a line . Nobody would have page-long monologues like we got . It was fabulous . One of my all-time favorite episodes was [ Season 1 s Nashville Bound ] where Charlene s entire family from the Ozarks comes to visit and I had to introduce them all by name . I was terrified . I said , If I do n t get this in the first take , I ll fall on the floor and die . [ The list ] went on and on and on and on and on and somehow , through pure terror and adrenaline , I nailed it the first time , thank God . Poor Meshach is watching going , Oh , damn ! because he had to do it again right after me . Oh , bless his heart . And Ronnie Claire Edwards , who played my mother , one of the funniest , if not the funniest , woman I ever met in my entire life she just passed away [ in June ] , and I was really , really sad about that . Smart : The other thing I liked about [ Linda s writing ] was that all four women were very , very different . Lots of times , you ll see on shows , comedies in particular , where the lines could be kind of interchangeable . But these women were so unique with themselves that you would n t be able to , say , take one of Charlene s lines and give it to Suzanne , or take one of Julia s lines and give it to Mary Jo . Bloodworth-Thomason : I do n t think [ the actresses ] get enough credit for that , because I get so much credit for writing them . They were bringing a lot of themselves to the characters their eccentricities , their little quirks , their manner of speaking . Their voices had a musicality to them , a rhythm , and I think it coincided with my writing rhythm , so it was kind of a little symphony when it worked . I like Southern voices anyway I married a Southern man [ Designing Women executive producer/director Harry Thomason ] , and I still love to hear him talk . It s just a soothing , melodic sound . Maybe this comes from my childhood , but I m comforted by it . Not to make too much of it , but I think the way that the show sounded was really important because it did n t sound like any other show on television . Dixie is very languid , and she has a trajectory that starts out slow and then ends up going off like a rocket . I wrote those speeches that way , but if you heard somebody else read them , it would n t have happened that way . Maybe it s a Southern cadence , but she owned it , and that evolved into her being The Terminator . When she would start on something in that slow drawl , when she got somebody in her gun sight , it was so much fun to watch because you were going on a trip with her and it was going to end in wild applause . She was just the master of controlling the trajectory and the speed of it and then the explosion at the end . Potts : The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia speech ? Come on . It does n t get any better than that on TV , I do n t think . In Season 1 s second episode , The Beauty Contest , Julia let loose on the reigning Miss Georgia World after she overheard her belittling Suzanne to a friend . Burke : Well , you know , Julia can make fun of Suzanne but nobody else can make fun of Suzanne . Linda asked me about my feelings on beauty pageants , and I talked about how it felt to have that crown on my head and how much I had loved them . She put that in there for Suzanne , so that was nice . It was an emotional moment for Suzanne . Luckily , I was in a doorway behind Dixie so I could n t see her face , because I would have been cracking . Dixie was just so brilliant in that and we would quote that forever , all the time . Bloodworth-Thomason : Julia was kind of my Sasha Fierce , like Beyonc has her Sasha Fierce . She gets to do and say all the things that you would never dare say . That was inspiring . That was also the same for Suzanne : She said some terrible things that you do n t like about yourself , the things that you are shallow about or politically incorrect about . You could never say those things but you could just put them right in Delta s mouth and they come out as funny . It was always with this high , melodic , self-assured voice that just got her off the hook . Her Southern lilt , and her careless way of throwing things away verbally really brought a lot to the humor . Jean had that kind of raspy Marilyn Monroe thing going on . She was the only non-Southerner , but her accent was just beautiful . She s very languid , very comforting , very soft . Charlene can say just about anything and be loved for it , because it just comes from such a good place . There s no meanness in her . She represents the inviolable goodheartedness of Southern women , where no one can crush their loyalty , no one can disrupt their optimism . If Charlene met somebody who cut a man s head off , she would immediately set about trying to understand it . I still think Annie had the toughest role . The things that she said were the most relatable things to the viewing audience . Eccentricity is so much easier than normalcy . That s pretty hard to do , to fulfill that Everywoman slot and still be very special , and very specific , and different from all the other characters . Annie is such a brilliant comedian , she managed to do that . Potts : I was a single mother for a lot of my time on that show , so it was important for me . There would be times when the show was on , and since it s gone off the air , that I d have people come up to me and say , I was a single mother then , or My mother was a single mother and we watched the show together , and you gave her such courage and meant so much to her . Of course , that s always very sweet to hear . Burke : That first year was so beautiful because we were so grateful to be there , to have these wonderful parts to play and that we all liked each other so much and worked together so well . We were just delirious with joy . On top of it , it s about these amazing characters that we re playing that are so funny and so witty and can pick on each other and defend each other and there s this wonderful , feminine bond . It was everything wonderful that you could think of . PART III : The Near Cancellation It s difficult to imagine now , but Designing Women almost became a one-season wonder . By the time the show premiered on Sept. 29 , 1986 , sandwiched between Newhart and Cagney & Lacey , CBS had a new programming exec in Shepherd s chair . Bloodworth-Thomason prefers not to mention his name , because they re still friends , but she will say he was not a fan of the show : He got up in New York and apologized for the show before they showed it . He got booed by the press . They d already seen some of it and they loved it . He did n t like it . It was foreign to him . Again , the wind is always never at your back if you re a Southern writer in Hollywood the wind is always in the front . Airing on Mondays , Designing Women landed in the top 30s in ratings . After a December move to Thursdays , opposite NBC s top 10 show Night Court , it fell into the 60s and off CBS s schedule . Potts : When I read the Ghostbusters script , it was like , This is going to be huge . I just know this is going to be huge . But you know , TV is such a difficult business and you just never know . There s no telling sometimes what the zeitgeist is going to be and what s going to land and take off and what s going to fall short . Four white women and a black man was unusual at that time , and being political , although Norman Lear certainly had been priming people for that for a decade by then . It was certainly to my taste , but you know how that is : It was like , Yeah , I think that ought to be a hit , but that s just my point of view . Smart : I had started to learn that that did n t necessarily mean anything in the business sense . The first show I did , I came out from New York to do a series with Lynn Redgrave and Norman Fell called Teachers Only . I remember when one of the executives came in to announce our time slot was [ moving to ] Saturday night . I was from the theater . I did n t know what that meant . Then Norman Fell turned and looked at all of us and said , Well , it s been nice working with you ! I did three more series after that that were kind of short-lived before Designing Women . I was just kind of na ve about that stuff back then . I guess I did n t really believe that they were going to cancel the show . I was like , Well , let s wait and see what happens . The show s hiatus would have turned into cancellation had viewers not mobilized for a record-setting write-in campaign . Potts : There was an organization called Viewers for Quality Television that , considering there was no Internet at the time , were able to exert quite a bit of influence . Linda and her husband were very smart to harness the energy of that , and it was the biggest write-in campaign in TV history at that time , when they took us off . Bloodworth-Thomason : My husband just saved the show . We make fun of him because he s always the fearless leader . He s like Charlene he never believes he s canceled . He just said , Hell , no , we re not canceled . He organized the letter-writing campaign that got 50,000 letters to CBS . Burke : We went on the road and toured around doing a lot of publicity and trying to get people to write in . I was teamed up with Jean , and we would go to different states . I remember we were landing in Seattle and there was smoke coming from the plane and a lot of fire trucks on the tarmac , and we thought we might be about to crash , and the first thing we did was to apply makeup . Smart : It was actually in San Francisco ! It s like an episode of the show ! We were flying into San Francisco and we were almost there , and the pilot came on and said that they were having a problem with their hydraulics . But I thought , Oh well , OK , that does n t sound great , but whatever , he sounds calm . And he said , We will be attempting to land on the runway or just beyond . And I thought , â€˜ Just beyond is the bay , I think . That does n t sound good . Delta and I were going , By God , if we re going to die , we re going to go down looking good ! So we whipped out the mascara and lip gloss and eye shadow . As the plane s coming down toward the tarmac , I guess nobody knew if the wheels were actually down or if the brakes were going to work before we touched down . You could see all these fire engines on both sides of the runway screaming past us going toward wherever it is we re going to end up , and I thought , Well , that does n t look good . But it was fine . Potts : I really do n t know how [ the Viewers for Quality Television ] did it without the Internet , but they did do it , and it saved us , and I m forever grateful to them . Bloodworth-Thomason : To his credit , Bud Grant [ then president of CBS Entertainment ] really listened to what the viewers were saying . He called Harry and said , Bring the cast and come over . That s when Bud Grant went out to the corner of CBS and raised a white flag and said , We surrender . Potts : Yes , I m pretty sure that actually happened . Where did that picture go ? Again , the Internet had n t been invented , so staged for what publication I do n t know , but we did do that . Bloodworth-Thomason : I ca n t imagine that ever happening today . A man in a position like that putting himself to be viewed that way . It said volumes about the kind of man he was , and how strong he was . He said , We re going to give you another chance . Thank God he did , because there were 150-some-odd episodes after that . Part IV : The Statement In Season 1 , Designing Women had tackled serious issues Charlene had a breast cancer scare after her doctor insisted she did n t need a second opinion in a special 60-minute episode , and Mary Jo was sexually harassed and nearly raped by a client in the season finale but it s the Season 2 episode Killing All The Right People that showed what the series was truly capable of . In it , a young interior designer and friend ( played by then-newcomer Tony Goldwyn ) came to Sugarbaker & Associates and asked the women to design a room for his funeral because he was dying of AIDS . At the same time , Mary Jo was volunteered to voice the pro argument for a PTA debate over condom distribution in schools . The episode , which earned writer Bloodworth-Thomason an Emmy nomination , is best remembered for two scenes : Julia escorting out a client who insisted , As far as I m concerned , this disease has one thing going for it it s killing all the right people , and Mary Jo s passionate closing argument : More important than what any civic leader , PTA , or board of education thinks about teenagers having sex or any immoral act that my daughter or your son might engage in , is the bottom line that I do n t think they should have to die for it . Bloodworth-Thomason : The day I found out that CBS was greenlighting Designing Women to be a series is the day I found out my mother had AIDS . That was in April of 1986 . She died in November of 1986 . For that period , I was writing scripts by her side in the hospital . It was hard to find a hospital then that was proficient in AIDS care . Nobody really knew how to deal with AIDS patients . We were all still wearing gloves and masks . Nobody knew exactly how it could be transmitted . They would put the medicine in a bucket and kick it into the room . We were not welcome at the hospital where we were . No nurses wanted to touch my mother or any of the 17 young men . It was my mom and 17 young men who were all dying on the same floor . A lot of those young men died alone with game shows playing across the hall in a sitting area . Only my mom s heroic AIDS doctor , Dr. Jeff Galpin , would come by and hold their hand when they died . They actually had my mother transferred to the Sherman Oaks Burn Center , which did have trained nurses , because she was treated so badly . One day I was standing out in the hall , and they were taking my mother for a test , wheeling her with their mask on . This woman , who was just a visitor at the hospital , was standing outside in her high heels and her purse , and she looked at my mom , and she did n t say anything , but I noticed her disdain . Then they wheeled a couple of AIDS patients who were young men . She took a look at them and said , Well , if you ask me , this disease has one thing going for it it s killing all the right people . It just sent chills up my spine . I could n t believe anyone could be that ignorant , or that cruel . If you have n t seen anyone die from AIDS , you can count yourself lucky in this life , because it is a horrible , horrible thing . I thought , OK , I ve got to do this show . We did , and everybody did it so beautifully . When I look at it today , it seems a little primary and not so sophisticated , but when we did it , it was the first AIDS show that had ever been done on a comedy . I was very proud of that . Smart : I had always been the kind of person who said , Oh , please , do n t have sitcoms do â€˜ a very special episode . Linda could always pull it off . She just was that kind of writer . It did n t seem disrespectful . It did n t seem rushed . It did n t seem cheesy . It was always really well done , and how she did that many times over in 22 minutes or however much time they d give us back then , it was kind of incredible . Potts : Linda was very political . She and Harry , their best friends were the Clintons . Everything had a purpose for her , and I was happy to carry all those messages . Burke : I was impressed that Linda wanted to tackle all types of topics that just really were n t in the sitcom arena . That was fun and interesting for us to get to do , to show the different viewpoints of the different characters . One big thing for Linda was , first of all , to show that Southerners were not stupid . Always on TV , whenever they would cast anybody Southern , they d make them an idiot . She wanted to show that these Southern women were very smart and very intelligent and also happened to be funny . Bloodworth-Thomason : Whether it was Green Acres or Beverly Hillbillies or Dukes of Hazzard , even on Andy Griffith , which was a favorite show of mine , the people where not the brightest lights . Now we re faced with this show where these women are very smart and they re saying some pretty smart stuff , and I think it was confusing not everybody got the value of it right away because it was new , it was different . I think we played a really important role in showing people that there s another side to the South than just all the stereotypes that are in everyone s head . Always it s called down there . I can not tell you how many friends of mine have said they would n t even want to go visit there . They still think most people there are n t very smart , are n t very educated , almost everybody has racial prejudice . Nobody had ever seen these liberal Southerners like Julia . It was always , You re not from around here , are you ? We were actually reflecting the part of the South that probably locates most of itself near universities , the people that you just ca n t get enough of , the place where Southern writers hung out . Designing Women did n t cure anything , but it certainly made people sit up and rethink what the South , especially the new South , is really about . You just do n t see other shows , or even necessarily other people from the South , championing the best aspects of it . Bloodworth-Thomason did have to strike a special deal with Dixie Carter , a conservative Republican : For every speech she had to deliver that she did n t completely agree with , she d get to sing in a later episode . Nothing I wrote did she ever turn down , Bloodworth-Thomason says with a laugh . She d kind of shake her head like , â€˜ I do n t like this , but she d get right to work on it because she knew it was going to end happily for her in another way . But she had CBS s full support . Bloodworth-Thomason : I never [ told CBS ] I was going to do all these issues . I said , I just want these women to be able to talk the way women really talk . They re not just going to sit around talking about their boyfriends and their hair . We started doing all these issues , and CBS had another power change , and they fell in love with this show . They thought it was the greatest thing that these women were talking about issues . They could n t get enough of it . Howard Stringer [ president of CBS from 1988 to 1995 ] traveled around giving speeches about , You ve got to see these women , and just listen to what they re talking about . They re not like anybody else on TV . I was given carte blanche . Jeff Sagansky [ president of CBS Entertainment from 1990 to 1994 ] is a Republican , and he never intervened in any way . He just basically told the creative people at CBS to let me do what I wanted to do because it was working . I got very , very few notes ever on Designing Women . Even when I wanted to do Clarence Thomas [ in Season 6 s The Strange Case of Clarence and Anita ] , they said , Great , do it . Again , that would not happen today . They would be horrified and mortified . It was fun and it was immediate . We were never one script ahead . Talk about living dangerously . Back then , it was a million at stake and a hundred people waiting on set . I never wrote the script until Saturday and Sunday each week . We would [ rehearse ] the show during the week , shoot it on Thursday , edit on Friday , then Saturday and Sunday , I d write another script . The messenger would always come on Sunday night and get it , and we d start over . I would just pray to God that I would n t run out of topics . My husband and I are Southern we sort of like that getting off the Titanic and boarding the Lusitania feeling . It s very exhilarating . Also invigorating was the decision to begin cultivating an unexpected friendship between Suzanne and Anthony in the Season 2 episode Stranded . They were traveling together to St. Louis to meet the others at a design show when a snowstorm closed the roads , forcing them to share a one-bed motel room that is , after Suzanne finally allowed freezing Anthony to come in from the van . Bloodworth-Thomason : Suzanne s smug , cavalier racism which did n t come from hatred , it came from poor information and prejudice that she d been taught affiliated with Anthony just telling it like it is , I just thought that would be funny together . He was always appalled by everything she said , yet there was this real affection between them . She just held on to these old ways . You know , Anthony , you re not so bad . I thought they gave a lot of hope to solving racial problems . They were one of the great relationships that came out of the show . Burke : Suzanne is not ever doing anything to be malicious . She just does these things and has no clue that it s mean maybe or racist maybe or could possibly be upsetting to anybody because it does n t come that way from her heart . Meshach and I , we had good chemistry and people pick up on that . When we were all in Arkansas at the house that they used as Sugarbaker House for the credits , they never could find us . They d go looking for me or looking for Meshach , and we d always be off someplace together . I think Linda saw that we kind of really hooked up as friends and she decided to use it in the show with Anthony and Suzanne always being off together or stuck together and things like that . Stranded is one of my very all-time favorite episodes . Anything with Meshach was just brilliant because he was so talented and such a genuinely wonderful man . I miss him so much . We were traveling together once promoting the show and they stuck us in a suite together . We had two different rooms , you know , but it was the same suite . I had a long-line brassiere I was trying to get myself into and I was having trouble doing it , and Meshach had to help me . So there was a little Anthony/Suzanne going on in our relationship off-camera . Part V : The Romance As any diehard Designing Women fan knows , Hal Holbrook was already married to Carter when he first appeared as widowed Julia s new love , attorney Reese Watson , in Season 1 . When Richard Gilliland began his recurring stint as Mary Jo s new boyfriend , Atlanta Braves scout J.D. Shackleford , that season , he fell in love with Smart . They married at Carter and Holbrook s home in 1987 . Richard actually had met all three of the other gals and he had worked with Delta a couple of times , Smart says . I said , â€˜ Do you know if he has a girlfriend ? Is he married ? She said , â€˜ I do n t know , and apparently , she walked right up to him and said , â€˜ She wants to know if you re single ! in Delta fashion , or Suzanne fashion , I do n t know which . It was mortifying , but I was kind of glad that she did it because we were never apart after that day . [ Later ] I found out that Richard had dated Delta . She did n t include that little detail . Burke made her own love connection in Season 2 , when Gerald McRaney guest-starred as Suzanne s favorite ex-husband . They wed in 1989 . Bloodworth-Thomason : I would absolutely say that there s never been a comedy on television where there was so much love and sexual chemistry going on . You might have tension , like on Cheers between Diane and Sam , but you did n t have romance sexy romance , like when Reese and Julia would dance together . He would start talking about her legs , and you d just go , Oh , you do n t see this on comedies . Again , I credit the women with that . They just exuded it . You were commanded to write to it . Burke : Fran Bascom , the casting director , said , We re thinking of John Ritter or Gerald McRaney to play your first ex-husband . I had met Mac a couple of months before at a Publicists Guild Awards thing , and I thought he was pretty good stuff and how was I ever going to hook up with him . So I said , Oh , get that Gerald McRaney . I think we ll have good chemistry . From the day he came on the set , we ve sort of been together . We had a kissing scene in the show , and he said , Can we have lunch together ? And I was on one of my diets , as usual , and I said , No , but you can join me in my trailer . So he came into my trailer and I remember saying to him , You know , it s so awkward to do that kiss on the stage in front of everybody . Why do n t we just get that out of the way right now . So we got to do our first kiss in the trailer , and it was pretty good . I thought , Well , now , if he kisses that good , then he s pretty damn good . [ When we did the kiss on set ] , I could n t remember my lines and we had to stop for a moment . Burke : [ There was also ] the infamous picnic , except we did n t bring a basket with food . We thought we d just go off to the backlot . I never ever saw anybody back there before , but all of a sudden this little tour cart comes through with a bunch of people on it . It was a little embarrassing . I was sort of a little trampy with him . I said , You know , could you lay on top of me just for one moment ? And he did . There was chemistry there , I have to say . Potts : I do remember after Mac and Delta started dating , she had had a lot of not-good relationships , so I asked him out for a drink and I did tell him if he hurt her that I would f *** ing kill him . I do remember that . Three episodes after Dash Goff , the Writer , Charlene finally met the man of her dreams , Col. Bill Stillfield ( Douglas Barr ) , in I ll Be Seeing You . Shortly after Charlene tells her friends she d like a soldier right out of World War II for her upcoming birthday , the handsome Air Force pilot walks into Sugarbaker & Associates with a job for them only Charlene thinks he s an early present , an actor hired to ask her out . After sparks fly on their first date , Charlene has a dream that transports all the women , Reese , and Anthony to World War II . Smart : [ The dream sequence ] was fun , and doing a little bit of the jitterbug with Anthony . My mom and dad were both in the service in the war , and my mother sang in the officers club with the band when she was in the Navy . She used to sing I ll Be Seeing You and stuff like that around the house , and I loved all that music . Bloodworth-Thomason : Gosh , I do n t think I even knew that . Smart : It was a nice coincidence because Charlene s the kind of person who would romanticize World War II . I mean the whole country did . Unfortunately , of course , the reality of it was n t all that romantic , but it was a time in this country that was unlike any other that came before or since . For better or for worse , the country came together like one big neighborhood block party . There was nothing more important than your neighbor and your country , and it was perfect for Charlene s character . She was a romantic . She might have had a lot of boyfriends that did n t mean she was sleeping with them . She was just like me . She was very old-fashioned about that kind of stuff . Bloodworth-Thomason : I liked that friction : She was very sensual , but she was a very good girl , which I think made her sexier . She never tried to sell it through her wardrobe or through any overt action . Douglas Barr always reminds me of the quintessential World War II guy that s well educated , and handsome , and so decent , just the best a man can be . I thought , Jean s got to have that guy , because Charlene deserves that guy . When she married Bill , you just knew Bill s a lucky man . You knew she was giving it all to him . Smart : The night that Charlene got married [ in Season 3 s Come On and Marry Me , Bill ] , I was sitting in my dressing room . I was , I confess , smoking a cigarette and wearing this incredibly tight wedding dress and looking in the mirror . I had a little suspicion for a week or so , but I looked at myself and I said , You are pregnant . Put that cigarette out . I put out that cigarette right at that moment . I never smoked again , except for a couple times in movies but it did n t make me want to smoke at all . I found out a couple days later officially that I was pregnant and I thought , Man , they got me married off right in time ! Charlene , too , became pregnant and gave birth to her daughter , Olivia , in the 60-minute Season 4 classic The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century . Dolly Parton guest-starred as Charlene s guardian movie star in another memorable dream sequence in which she told Charlene that she was about to meet the person who d be holding her hand when it was her time to go . Bloodworth-Thomason : I just love Dolly . As everyone else knows , along with Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson , she s one of the most authentic performers in American music history . Of course I knew that she acted , and I just thought she fit with Charlene . She has a lot of the same qualities , especially her sexuality that s never exploited in a bad way . I thought they would be perfect together . I ve had more people talk to me about that episode because they loved the connection that Dolly brought between Charlene and her little girl , who was about to be born . I ve had men come up to me and tell me they cried watching that episode because it just meant a lot to them . It stirred a lot of people . I think Jean and Dolly were so flawless in it . Smart : I ve always found if the words are good , it s real easy for me to go there [ emotionally ] , and also , I had just had my son . For about a month or so after I delivered , the character was still pregnant and they were still padding me to make me look immensely pregnant . It was just a fun , meaningful episode . I have a picture of Dolly on my bookshelf , of her holding my son in his little onesie . She s got these long , four-inch fuchsia fingernails and that big , gorgeous smile and my son s going , Oh ! Where are those fingernails going ? Her bare hand was like right in his bum . It was very cute . Very cute . Bloodworth-Thomason s all-time favorite episode of the series is the Season 2 finale , Reservations for Eight . Charlene and Bill , Julia and Reese , Mary Jo and J.D. , and Suzanne and Dash intend to spend the weekend skiing together but get snowed in at their cabin instead . When the women suggest the sleeping arrangements not be co-ed , a verbal battle of the sexes erupts between everyone but canoodling Charlene and Bill , who , in the end , take the dance floor and lead the others to make up . Bloodworth-Thomason : I probably loved Reservations for Eight more than any episode because it really highlighted the male/female thing that we were trying to do . The show was known for its feminism . That episode in particular highlighted that we were men-loving feminists . I wanted to make that so clear . I think that s one thing that millennial women had to learn to sort through today . I think that they had the impression that all feminists in the past were man-hating : We burned our bras , we hated men , we did n t even marry men . It was a very rude depiction of feminist and feminism . I wanted Designing Women to stand in the cultural ether as a show that represented feminism in the best way . Southern women , of course we love men . We do n t love all men we re going to have to show you the errors of your ways but we love men . I thought that episode really depicted it . We had a lot of romance on the show . That s another thing I m proud of , because again , I think that s missing in a lot of comedy today . A lot of couples in comedies are asexual , especially on network . If they re on cable , they re so screwed up you can hardly recognize them as anybody you would ever know . Bloodworth-Thomason : There s a definite symbiosis between what is going on now and what we were talking about [ in Julia s speech , about men having only themselves to blame if they re not happy with the world , since they ve been running it ] . We ve been fighting this battle forever . Women had to get up earlier . They had to work twice as hard . No , we re not whiny crybabies we ve done everything while smiling , and having all the children , and making the most money . We ve been good sports , but damn it , enough is enough . Hillary [ Clinton ] is still the Rorschach test for Oh my gosh , am I talking too loud ? Did I laugh too hard ? I mean , my God , the small lane that women are supposed to stay in as they try to progress is astonishing . VI : The Drama It s no secret that there came a time when Designing Women was not only ripping stories from the headlines , it was making headlines . Tabloids followed Burke s weight gain like a sport , taking odds on whether it would affect her new marriage and her job on the show . Despite the show â€˜ s earning three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series ( for Seasons 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and Burke nabbing two Emmy nominations herself ( the first for Season 4 s They Shoot Fat Women , Do n t They ? , which addressed Suzanne s weight ) , the set became strained to the point that Burke s contract was n t renewed for Season 6 . People magazine ran a 2,000-word feature in July 1991 asking , Was Delta Burke a disruptive egomaniac ? Or a troubled victim of a vindictive set ? The piece ended with Harry Thomason saying , I do n t know what happened or what we did . We wish her well . We hope she has every success in the book . Twenty-five years later , there is a better understanding of what went wrong : None of those 2,000 words were depression and panic attacks . Burke : Everything that I had ever wanted was coming true . I was starring in a TV show , I had a wonderful part , I m making great money , I ve met the man of my dreams . But something was going on the pressure of something was too much . I began to have those horrible panic attacks . Nobody had heard of them back then . Nobody talked about depression , No. 1 , and they did n t talk about panic attacks . They were totally unaware of them . They would hit me out of nowhere , like you know the cartoon where the 10-ton weight smacks the coyote . Out of the blue , this thing would hit me over the head , and I would just freeze where I was on the stage , and I wanted to say I m so sorry , but I could n t speak . I would just try to stagger off the set , and by that time , I would start making screaming sounds and shaking and Meshach would catch me and take me back to my dressing room . I did n t know what I was doing . I was just having a complete meltdown panic attack . Then , apparently , the girls were all thinking , Who s going to go in and talk to her ? They would send Dixie in , of course . And Dixie would go in there and just pet me and love me and tell me everything was all right and I was going to be OK and calm me down . At first they began to treat me with medication : Whenever I would have an attack , I would take this pill . Then they began to teach me that when you feel this attack coming which I never felt it coming , but I paid attention and did notice that yeah , my body did feel kind of strange take your pill then , and you wo n t have the attack . I thought , What if this happens while I m shooting ? I d be so embarrassed and mortified because it was so humiliating . I remember shooting one day , and I said to the second AD , I ve got to go to my dressing room . He said , No , we ve got to shoot something . I said , I ve got to take a pill . He said , Go . Go . Go to your room . Because they knew what would happen if I did n t take that pill . Finally I learned how to not have the attacks without having to take medicine . I was dealing with a psychiatrist , like four or five days a week at that point , because I was in a high-pressure situation and I had to function somehow . Bloodworth-Thomason : I did n t realize that s what was wrong with her . I just could n t figure it out . We were all in a big misunderstanding . That sounds like a cop-out , but we really were . Nobody had the right information . Everybody was acting on wrong information . We were thinking , My God , what s wrong with you ? This is the greatest thing that s ever happened to all of us . You re making a bundle of money , you ve got the role of a lifetime , and really , you ca n t be happy and you re mad at us ? We just kept saying , Why are you mad at us ? Nobody wants you to lose weight . Stop saying this . She had a different thing going on in her head , and we did not know , or understand , about the panic attacks . It really affected me deeply when I found that out , because had I known that , I would have had a completely different perspective on how we talked to her . Burke s all-time favorite episode of the show is Season 4 s Rowdy Girls . Fans will remember it for Charlene s convincing her cousin Mavis ( Kim Zimmer ) to leave her abusive husband and for the talent show in which Suzanne , in blackface , lip-synced Mickey & Sylvia s Love is Strange with Anthony and the Supremes Ai n t No Mountain High Enough with Julia , Mary Jo , and Charlene . Burke : The day before [ filming it ] there had been something really awful in the tabloids , and I really could n t cope with it . I had driven up into the hills and parked my car and I was extremely depressed . That was when I had the gun with me . [ Her voice breaks ] It s hard to talk about , but I was very depressed and I kept taking Valium to help the pain go away . Apparently I ended up back home and everything , but I guess I had taken too much Valium . The doctor came to see me and I was fine , but I should n t have gone to work the next day . I do n t know how I drove to work . I do n t remember it . Apparently , throughout that day , I do n t remember this happening , but they would have to walk me around the soundstage to keep me moving and going . They were thinking , There s no way she can do the show . She s in really bad condition . [ But ] when the show happened , I clicked and I was safe . I was on safe ground . I could go out there and do the show like nothing had happened . I do n t why that was , or how that was , I was just very thankful for it . So I was able to do the show , and it was the show I loved so much with Anthony . In blackface . Bloodworth-Thomason : That was one of my favorite episodes too . I just love them performing together . When I think of the women as a group , one of the main images that I have is of them in those outfits . The way that Delta was performing and the way Dixie kept looking at her like , Just get out of here , get out of my sight . I m not very self-analytical when I write . I think just organically . I probably thought , Gee , this [ spousal abuse ] is really so devastatingly depressing , we need something really outrageously funny . I do n t think a regular network would allow that today a cable network would . I wanted to do that because I wanted to poke a hole in political correctness . Again , Delta was so innocent when she did that . The fact that it was so horrible allowed Dixie to just go miles and miles and miles down the road of righteous indignation , like , What the hell is wrong with you ? And then Delta grinning at her she was not understanding what she s done . Burke : The audience just laughed and screamed . They thought it was a hoot that Suzanne would do that . They loved it . The audience laughed , cried , and applauded five weeks later when they watched the taping of Season 4 s They Shoot Fat Women , Do n t They ? As Suzanne asked for opinions on dresses to wear for her 15-year high school reunion weekend , Julia and Mary tried to prepare her for her former classmates reaction to her weight gain , which turned out to be even crueler . After a heart-to-heart with Julia , Suzanne decided to go to the second night s festivities after all . When she won the award for Most Changed , she delivered an Emmy nomination-worthy acceptance speech that explained how she had changed : The old Suzanne would n t have forgive them . Burke : I just remember thinking that we ve got to deal with this . It s the elephant in the room . I went to Linda and I said , All I m asking is , please do n t make the butt of the jokes let the jokes come from Suzanne and give Suzanne the power . And that s what she did . Then it was no problem for me to talk about the weight because I was the one that was taking control of [ the conversation ] . When we were reading the script for the network on Monday , there were a few gasps because , you know , Linda s got me saying things like , You all act like I should be ordering fabric over at Georgia Tent and Awning or I ll just be going now , if you think the streets of Atlanta can stand the strain of both me and my Mercedes . They thought , What is Delta thinking to be saying these lines ? Is it going to upset her ? But I thought they were hysterical . Then they realized I was OK with it , so everybody kind of calmed down . When we were shooting [ Suzanne s acceptance speech ] , the audience got very involved and very emotional and did do this wonderful ovation . It meant a great deal . I also had these women coming up to me saying , It s so nice to be represented , to have â€˜ one of us be on TV . At first I thought , What ? I was kind of confused . Then I realized what they were talking about and I was getting all of this support . Through all of the times with the weight , and all the issues and all the bad press about it , they sent me wonderful letters . It was so moving . I would carry those letters while I was filming . I would stick them in my bra or in my shoe or in my purse . Those letters helped to give me strength to do what I had to do . I certainly did n t feel like God s gift to women , but Suzanne did and so somehow I had to play that . That episode helped me personally as well as the character . Bloodworth-Thomason : She tore your heart out . She just was so good . She was better than the writing in that . I never cared what Delta weighed . That s what I was so frustrated about . I could n t even go get my haircut without somebody coming up and saying to me , How dare you tell Delta Burke to lose weight . Which is just so maddening and crazy . I actually thought it made the character more interesting if a former beauty queen gained weight . It was like a gift to me as a writer . I did n t want her to be unhealthy , but I could not have cared less . That was a misconstrued thing in the public that I really wanted to do that show that straightened it out . I wanted us to all be friends again , which we are . Delta and Mac and Harry and I always say , Yeah , it s like Southern family : They fight , they come back . They kiss and they love . Part VII : The Ending Both Burke and Jean Smart , who wanted to pursue other roles and spend more time with her young family , parted ways with the show after Season 5 . Viewers learned in the Season 6 premiere that Suzanne had already headed to Japan to be closer to her mother off-screen , while Charlene appeared to say goodbye before relocating to England for Bill s work . The series continued for two more years : first with Julia Duffy as cousin Allison Sugarbaker and Jan Hooks as sister Carlene Frazier Dobber , then with Hooks and Judith Ivey as wealthy client turned partner B.J. Poteet . Burke reunited with Bloodworth-Thomason in 1995 , however , for the short-lived series Women of the House in which Suzanne took over her late husband No. 5 s congressional seat . Burke : I do n t know what happened to Suzanne after that . [ Linda ] would always say that Suzanne and Anthony were going to end up married . I think that would ve been something . I wonder how people would have reacted to that one . Bloodworth-Thomason : I think that she would have ended up in a biracial nursing home with Anthony . I do n t think it would have been conjugal I think he would still be rolling his eyes , and she d still be ordering him around . I do n t think she ever would have found a man who really met her requirements the way Dash did . I think they would have always been â€¦ I do n t know if you call it friends with benefits , but I do n t think they ever would have stopped seeing each other . I think he would be the great love of her life . Smart : I m sure Charlene would have been charmed by the English culture , high tea and all that kind of stuff , you know , but I think she would have also enjoyed teaching them something that she would have learned at home in the Ozarks , like rendering hog fat into candles or something . I would think that she eventually would want to come home and raise her children at home . Bloodworth-Thomason : I think Charlene would have been married to Bill forever , probably have a ton of grandchildren , just would have constantly celebrated family . She d probably be on the Cooking Channel today , like Trisha Yearwood , and have her own show as Southern cooking . I think Mary Jo would probably have had another marriage that did n t work out . That s just her character . She s always just doing things for everybody else , and the grandchildren , and all that . I think she would have stayed in the design business , and I think to the end she would have been a good soul . Potts : I guess Mary Jo probably took over for Julia and is mentoring some young , awesome women coming up the ladder . Bloodworth-Thomason : I think Julia would have had to evolve into some sort of Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey . I think Julia had that kind of grandness . I think she would have been the primo female in Atlanta society , the one that people go to for a famous quip . She always has the dart ready if there s a well-deserved target , sort of the Dorothy Parker of Atlanta . I think she would have carried that on until her death . Dixie s funeral , I never cried so hard at a funeral for a nonfamily member of mine . I loved her so deeply , so personally , but I also mourned the loss of Julia Sugarbaker . There s nobody on this show was loved more than Dixie . Of all of them , she was my soulmate . I ll just never stop wanting to see her again . If I could call a number right now and hear her talk , I would probably call it once a week , just to hear her . Smart : I said this to Hal one time after she passed , and he said it meant a lot to him . I said , The two of you were like teenage boyfriend and girlfriend you were n t like husband and wife . Even though she was the oldest of the four of us , she was , in every respect except chronologically , the youngest of the four of us . She was just like a giddy schoolgirl . She was the cutest , most bubbly person . I admired her relationship with her daughters . I did n t have kids yet when I met her , and I thought , Oh , my God , If I ever have kids , I hope they look at me the way they look at her . They just idolized her . One time she was having a garden party at her house , and she had a big old hat and she d had a couple glasses of champagne , and she s sitting out there doing God knows what , and her daughters are just looking at her like she is a goddess that just dropped from heaven . She was the most glamorous thing that had ever happened . Bloodworth-Thomason : Oh , my God , you d go to her house , and you d have to stay all evening because it takes her forever to come downstairs . You re there forever having drinks and hors d oeuvres . She s always got somebody in the kitchen who s inept . I do n t know where she hires people . She had the staff that you ca n t believe . She s got her dad s Tennessee Sheriffs Association Cadillac parked outside . It s an old Cadillac , at this old house , in Hancock Park . Dixie comes out about 9:30 , leaning over the banister from upstairs going , Oh , is there a party ? She goes on and on , and then she comes downstairs . Then she goes , I do n t know what s wrong with that cook . Everybody s getting so hungry . You go in and you hear a lot of clamber and pots and pans rattling . Then she comes back out , It s going to be just a little bit . Then after dinner , she s lying across the piano with a martini . She singing now , I ve Got a Crush on You . This whole night has been so worth it . Even though you were really hungry and you thought , Please , can I just go home , when you do , you think , Oh , my God , I m so glad I went to that . In addition to priceless memories like those , each of the women left Designing Women with at least one memento . Smart : I wish I had that big wicker chair [ Charlene sat in ] . My husband says I need a 12-step program for wicker collecting . I do love me some wicker . What I do have , and I m not sure where it is , is one of Charlene s business cards from her desk . I tell my children , Save this , and when I m dead and gone , sell it on eBay . Burke : I wish I had kept that little-bitty pin that Suzanne would stick in her hair like a crown , but unfortunately I did not . I do have a negligee and one outfit , I think . â€¦ I wish I had kept that pin . Potts : I have the name that was on my door . For the premiere , Linda made us all needlepoint pillows that had a quote from each of our characters from the pilot , which is very sweet . Mine was a line in regard to how when you re married to a gynecologist it s a little tough , because what can you do that he has n t seen a hundred of that day . The line was : Because you can only do so much with what you ve got , if you know what I mean . I still have that . It s one of my treasures . Bloodworth-Thomason : I have Bernice s Christmas skirt , you know , where she took the Christmas tree skirt and wore it . Every year somebody in my hometown in Missouri tries to buy it . There s a big scholarship foundation back in my hometown called the Designing Women Foundation . The money Designing Women has made has put over 157 women through college . I love the idea that the legacy lives on , that these loudmouth Southern women were able to actually make a lot of money , then we put our money where our mouth was . I did it in memory of my mother , whose name was Claudia . We sent little girls from the Ozarks all over the world , trying to enrich them culturally . They go to Broadway and they come out here [ to California ] . They ve been to Europe . We still have a lot of programs . It s been a wonderfully rewarding privilege to be able to transfer the money from television to real-life progress for women . Part VIII : The Hope Asked what they hope fans remember when thinking about the show 30 years later , it should be no surprise that Bloodworth-Thomason has a thorough answer . Smart : Just that it was , I hope , a lot of fun to watch , and it did n t ever talk down to the audience . That it was clever and funny and was n t cruel and was n t crude . That it was sort of classy and silly . Burke : Mainly it s the intensity of the friendships between the women . That they were there for each other no matter what . That s what speaks loudest to me . I love that they are Southern and they are intelligent and that they re showing that to the world . Potts : I hope they remember all the scenes that were in it about the empowerment of women , how women can be beautiful and smart and funny and incisive . I think that we did lay some groundwork for that , and I hope that we played our little part in perhaps making it OK for the next president to be a woman . Bloodworth-Thomason : I think Designing Women has played a small role , even in Hillary s journey . So has Mary Tyler Moore , Bea Arthur on Maude , the Golden Girls , Candice Bergen on Murphy Brown . All the women on television who have given women confidence to be who they are and to defy stereotypes through the years , especially a lot of the Norman Lear women , have done more to change the trajectory of women than anything else . I think the deepest and most lasting way to change things is to do it through art . Legislation does not change hearts and minds art does . And the best art form to do it in is still comedy . It makes the medicine taste sweet . We ca n t lose that sort of charge , that urgency . I know you never really reach the goal line if you do , you do n t know you re there , because there will always be a new challenge . But we re so far from being where we should and could be . TV is still the most powerful tool in the world . I think there s a lot of squandering of opportunity , especially on network [ television ] of female comedy . Just talking about nothing , just talking about your boyfriend , and your hair , and trends . It s just vapid . It does n t help we re in the face of the Kardashian culture . Mary Tyler Moore , Maude , Murphy Brown , Designing Women you just saw the feminism . It was roaringly funny . I just want to see more and more women doing that . I think the millennials have said , Hey , we know we re equals so we do n t have to talk about it . That really is n t the case . We re not equal . I wo n t get on my soapbox , but we re still coming up short in almost everything that you can measure in terms of salary , and child care , and just carrying the bigger load . Just the way we re oversexualized still , and the huge number of us who are slaughtered every year . You re killed because you have a vagina , just the way elephants are killed because they have ivory . I still say rape is a hate crime all over the world . I do n t think enough people make this connection . I think it s our duty to lead and inspire the millennial women , and the men , too , who want to come along . Just because the world seems a certain way , just because you have found it this way , does not mean that we re not still on a journey . We are . I think Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and women like that absolutely carry the gene . There so many new brilliant comedians on cable , like Tig Notaro , who does [ Amazon s ] One Mississippi . I love Full Frontal With Samantha Bee . I do think they re in the spirit of Designing Women . I love that Lena Dunham , Amy Schumer , all these women openly brag about , Hell , yes , I m a feminist on the covers of magazines . There was a long period where nobody would go on a talk show and say they were a feminist . It was like , for them , saying , I m a sexless , neutered man-hater . I m a big , strident , unattractive bully . That changed . Now I think that 60 percent of millennial woman identify feminist . That s made me so happy . Even though I think a lot of them have n t seen Designing Women if they did see it , I think they d love it . Dixie , Delta , Jean , and Annie can be so proud , even if they never did another thing , that they ve played a huge role in a very historic journey . Designing Women is currently not streaming online or in reruns , but all seven seasons are available on DVD .",

		"paragraph": "FX has released the first full trailer for its new ten-episode drama , \" Fargo \" ( debuting April 15 ) , based on the Coen brothers ' 1996 indie-film masterpiece . And as one of the characters might say , it looks like a real doozy . It tells a different story with different characters than the original film ( we have n't seen any sign of a wood-chipper yet ) , but the pitch-black comedic tone and the Minnesota-nice accents are here in full effect .

		"paragraph": "On Keeping Up With the Kardashians , Kendall Jenner was angry with her mother Kris , who did not want to invite her ex-husband , Caitlyn Jenner , to their family s annual Christmas party . It all started when Kim , Khlo and Kris teamed up against Kourtney , shaming her for not wanting to invite her ex , Scott Disick , to the party . Kris argued that Scott has been a part of their family for 10 years , so Kourtney had to invite him , which caused Kendall to ask , What about my dad ? An awkward silence fell over Kris , who was clearly caught in her own hypocrisy . Kim then stated , Scott has never done anything mean or said anything negative , so that s different , to which Kendall asked , Is that actually a joke ? Kendall then pointed out that both Caitlyn and Scott have done f*cked up things in different ways . Kris chimed in saying , But nobody that s coming would even know how to respond to her because of all the things Kendall cut her off there , snapping back , So the f*ck what ? Why are we worried about anyone else ? It s the night even if she does n t come , it s nice to have While it s no secret that there was a falling out between Caitlyn and the Kardashians , Kendall was just shocked that her mother could not see the comparison between inviting Caitlyn and inviting Scott . Kris told Kendall that the difference was that she has a relationship with Scott , but Kendall immediately called her out , saying , Oh , you did n t have a relationship with my dad for 25 years ? So far this season , Kourtney has been distancing herself from the rest of her family because she has not been getting along with Kim and Khlo and , following the drama between Kendall and her mom , it seems like maybe Kourtney will finally have one of her family members on her side . This is exactly why my sisters and I have n t been getting along , said Kourtney . They just do n t have my back , and they do n t take my feelings into consideration . And now I feel like the same thing is happening with Kendall . If it s not exactly what they think , there s always , you know , criticism and judgment , and I m not here to be criticized every day .

		"paragraph": "By Ryan Woo and David Lawder BEIJING/WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $ 16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment , the Chinese commerce ministry said , as the world 's largest economies escalated their trade dispute . The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23 , the ministry said , the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $ 16 billion of Chinese goods . The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday . China 's final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June , which included crude oil . The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft , although the total value is unchanged . The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions , after Washington imposed tariffs on $ 34 billion in goods last month . China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action . \" This is a very unreasonable practice , \" the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China 's counter-tariffs . To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil , China added fish meal , wood waste , paper and paper waste , metal scraps , and various types of bicycles and cars , among other products . Last week , China proposed additional tariffs on another $ 60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent . So far , China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $ 110 billion of U.S. goods , representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products . Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft . A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative 's office could not immediately be reached for comment on China 's retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump 's next round of threatened tariffs on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods . USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs , which could reach 25 percent , due to end Sept. 5 . It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties . Gary Hufbauer , a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions . \" My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $ 250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections . That 's soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument , but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019 . Of course , China will retaliate , probably dollar for dollar , \" Hufbauer said . China , however , would run out of U.S. imports to levy , as it bought only $ 130 billion worth of American goods last year . It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference .

		"paragraph": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has handed over a report on its brief investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh , President Donald Trump s latest pick for the Supreme Court . As far as the White House is concerned , the report should end the firestorm around Kavanaugh s confirmation , which is set to go to a procedural Senate vote Friday a so-called cloture vote designed to limit debate . However , the woman at the center of the allegations suggested that the investigation was deliberately meaningless . The FBI did not interview Kavanaugh s primary accuser , Christine Blasey Ford , nor did it interview anyone who could have backed up her version of events in the early 1980s , when she claims Kavanaugh assaulted her . The White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation s supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh , and it is being transmitted to the Senate , said White House spokesman Raj Shah on Twitter in the early hours of Thursday morning . With Leader McConnell s cloture filing , senators have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation , Shah continued . With this additional information , the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court . In fact , senators had no opportunity to see the FBI report at the time of Shah s tweets . They and only the senators , not their staff can see the report from 8 a.m. Thursday morning . There is only one copy , in paper format . It can only be read in a secure facility or after being brought to a senator by a designated staffer , and 100 senators need to read it before the Friday vote . The FBI did not include any conclusions as to whether Ford or Kavanaugh was telling the truth . The report is not supposed to be leaked or even publicly described by those who read it . Bloomberg reported that the agency lacked White House approval to speak to Kavanaugh or Ford . An FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses who corroborate her testimony can not be called an investigation , Ford s lawyers said in a statement . We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward , those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth . The FBI did interview Deborah Ramirez , another woman who accuses Kavanaugh of sexual assault . However , Ramirez s lawyer , John Clune , expressed skepticism that the agency would follow up by contacting witnesses that she identified . Though we appreciated the agents who responded on Sunday , we have great concern that the FBI is not conducting or not being permitted to conduct a serious investigation , Clune said Tuesday . This FBI investigation probably would n t have taken place but for the last-minute interventions of Republican Senators Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski swing votes on Kavanaugh s confirmation who demanded it following last week s testimonies by Ford and Kavanaugh . Since then , the president mocked Ford at a public rally , impersonating her and exaggerating the gaps in her memory regarding the 36-year-old alleged assault . Flake and Susan Collins , another Republican whose vote is undecided , expressed outrage at Trump s comments . The White House subsequently claimed that Trump was not mocking Ford .",

		"paragraph": "There have been scores of TV movies tracing the rise ( and usually fall ) of pop groups , most of them trite , a few of them exciting . While I know the return on investment in watching any one of these is low , I m still a sucker for showbiz sagas like this . ( My all-time fave : Dead Man s Curve , made in 1978 about the beach-music duo Jan and Dean , played by Bruce Davison and a pre-Battlestar Galactica Richard Hatch . ) So when it came to The New Edition Story , a three-night event movie on BET starting Tuesday , I came to the project with high hopes and low expectations . My devotion to the genre was rewarded : The New Edition Story is an exceptionally well-made , fast-paced , warts-and-all biopic . It follows the usual narrative path hardscrabble kids hustling to make it big , achieving stardom only to have the group riven with infighting and ego . But that narrative is a strong backbone , one that supports first-rate performances , and the cast does a notably fine job of re-creating the music of these young men , who gave us such prime pop-R & B as Candy Girl , Popcorn Love , and Mr. Telephone Man . Related : The New Edition Story EP on Why the Group Wanted to Share Its History , Warts and All As written by Abdul Williams and directed by Chris Robinson , The New Edition Story picks up the story at its roots , in the Roxbury section of Boston , where Bobby Brown , Michael Bivens , and Ricky Bell form a vocal group that expands into a quintet in the wake of the Jackson 5 s massive success . Taken in by a manager played by Wood Harris ( who would n t want The Wire s Avon Barksdale as their manager ? ) and guided to stardom by producer Maurice Starr ( a wonderfully world-weary Faizon Love ) , each member is played by at least two actors as they grow from kids to adult every one of them is excellent , which is no small feat . The details are frequently quite witty , such as the re-creation of a late - 70s show at Manhattan s Roseland theater , in which New Edition was top-billed over Madonna and Kurtis Blow . Proto-rapper Blow , auteur of The Breaks and played by Melvin Jackson Jr. , takes one look at the young-teen New Edition in their uniform suits and bow ties and says dismissively , What are y all ? Nation of Islam ? We know how the story ends : Bobby Brown leaves/is kicked out ( the movie manages to give equal weight to both theories ) , three members leave to form Bell Biv DeVoe ( remember the new jack swing of Poison ? ) , and there are various episodes of bad behavior and worse . But The New Edition Story remains vibrant and clever . It takes a group that is arguably underrated and gives it a glowing showcase . The New Edition Story airs Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday at 9 p.m. on BET .",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the Vote Early , Vote Often episode of Survivor : Game Changers contains spoilers . The Survivor flag is flying at half-staff today . Survivor fans across the country are wearing their buffs around their arms in commemoration . Why ? The queen is dead . That s right the unthinkable happened . Sandra Diaz-Twine , Survivor â€˜ s only two-time winner , finally had her torch snuffed . My childhood was already stomped into dust this past Sunday night at Wrestlemania when Roman Reigns retired The Undertaker , so why not just completely bury my soul in the dirt . Now my all-time favorite Survivor player is voted out for the very first time , bringing an end to one of the greatest reigns in not only Survivor history but game show history as a whole . Ninety-four days . That s how many days Sandra has played this game ( not in a row , this is n t Australian Survivor ) . She went 93 of those days without ever being eliminated . That s 2,232 hours of gameplay over three seasons where she attended a total of 28 tribal councils and only ever received one vote against her that counted . She outwitted , outplayed , and outlasted icons of the game such as Rupert Boneham , Jonny Fairplay , Russell Hantz , Parvati Shallow , Boston Rob , and Tony Vlachos . She competed in the old school era ( when idols were just a glimmer in Probst s eye ) , the middle years , and now the new school BIG MOVEZ era . And , most importantly , she was awarded the $ 1 million check twice ! There is a reason she receives an ovation from her tribe upon leaving this episode . Another Shake-Up It all starts with Jeff Probst , a phrase becoming all too familiar when it relates to terrible , terrible twists . He tells the three tribes to drop their buffs . The second tribe swap of the season sees the 15 remaining players shuffled into two new tribes well , everyone but Debbie , who does n t draw a buff . Probst informs the balancing specialist that she ll be heading to Exile Island and will join the losing tribe after the next tribal council . The new tribes are as follows : Mana : Aubry , Brad , Cirie , Hali , Michaela , Sierra , and Troyzan . Nuku : Andrea , Jeff , Ozzy , Sandra , Sarah , Tai , and Zeke . Crazy Island Debbie . Things instantly look sketchy for Jeff and Sandra , having gone from the top to the bottom in a New York minute as Jeff phrases it . Aubry and Troyzan , however , are given new life . While outcasts on their previous tribes , this shake-up gives them the opportunity to build new relationships , and we see that right away as Brad reaches out to Troyzan on the basis that we re both men . A high chance this is going to be the worst alliance ever . On the new-new-Nuku ( blame the constant swaps ) , all eyes are on the queen . Zeke states that Sandra is the most dangerous player in the game and they need to take her out before the merge , otherwise she ll end up winning again . The plan is to feed Sandra and Jeff a story , pretending that the tribe really wants to vote out Tai , a ruse which Jeff seems to buy even though he knows he should n t fully trust it . Sandra is n t so confident but assures us that once she gets her feet wet , she ll be running things on this tribe , too . An Exile Surprise Meanwhile , Debbie makes her way to Exile . She says she can handle it because she spent a lot of time alone as a kid with just her and her pony . That s animal cruelty making that poor pony spend time alone with Debbie . But wait â€¦ there s another twist ! It turns out Exile is n t a desolate island where Debbie must fend for herself , it s a luxury yacht with a full spread of food . But wait â€¦ there s another twist ! As Debbie is filling up on shrimp cocktails , a boat pulls up carrying Survivor : Caramoan winner John Cochran . No , he s not there to plug his new CBS sitcom but to act as a sounding board for Debbie . I believe at this point in my notes I wrote , WHAT IS THIS S T ?! Cochran had more confessionals in this one segment than Andrea has had all season . It was just weird like some sort of Survivor Aftershow where Cochran interviewed Debbie about her game so far , except it was stuck in the middle of the actual show . This is not acceptable in Sandra s send-off episode ! But wait â€¦ there s another twist ! After trying to convince Debbie that calling Brad a wanker is probably not her smartest move , Cochran presents her with a secret game advantage . She can choose between a fake idol making kit , an extra vote , or a tribal immunity challenge advantage . Debbie picks the extra vote because who came to Survivor to sew ? Plus , screw those other people , right ? I d have probably picked the same , although the extra vote has a cursed history in this game , and I m not sure Debbie s going to be the one to utilize it to full effect . I despised this whole segment . I do n t mind Cochran , but I did n t understand the point of him here . It ate up way too much time and served no real purpose other than Probst getting his buddy on TV again . The advantage could have just been waiting for Debbie on the boat sans Cochran . But in a season of Game Changers , I guess the twists will just keep on coming . It s getting to the point where next week I expect Probst to bring out a giant Wheel of Fortune-style wheel for the contestants to spin . Maybe someone will win Tai Chi lessons with Coach ? Or perhaps an Idol Finding 101 course with Russell Hantz ? Tai Freak Out After a shut-out in the immunity challenge , the Nuku tribe has a tribal council looming . Jeff is confident that everyone wants Tai out , but Sandra senses something is n t quite right and sets about working her magic on the tribe . Sandra has always had a scary ability to read a room ( or campsite ) . She knows when someone is n t forthcoming with the whole truth . And while the vote ultimately goes against her here , she was able to pick up on the bad juju . She makes a pitch to Andrea , Ozzy , and Sarah about targeting the remaining Kaoh Rong players . But it s her magic which makes her so threatening , because as Ozzy and Sarah soon admit , they almost began to fall for Sandra s words . Sarah says that Sandra sucks you in because she speaks so calmly and in a matter of fact way . Yes , we ve seen Sandra argue with the best of them , but she never freaks out when it comes to the game . She gives off confidence and charm , and it s that which draws people in . Tai , on the other hand , is the opposite of Sandra . Even though he s been playing a fairly impressive game so far , he is easily paranoid and prone to freak-outs . Not that his worries are completely unwarranted : his tribe has set him up as the decoy boot . Tai recognizes his own paranoia , which is partly brought on by discovering not one , but two hidden idols in the same episode ( a Survivor first ? ) ! Earlier in the episode , he poured water on the wooden boards of the water well at both his old and new camp , revealing tribe symbols which allowed him to locate the idols . For some , having all that power would make them feel untouchable , but for Tai , it s a burden . When he sees his tribemates sneaking off for private discussions without him , it only makes him more nervous . He approaches Ozzy and Jeff to make sure everyone is still voting Sandra , inadvertently revealing the real plan to Jeff , who informs Sandra . Sandra tells Jeff that she ll act like she is going home and then call out Tai at tribal council . The Reign Is Over At tribal , once again , things break down into all out chaos . Sandra plays up that she s going home , but Tai is n t so sure . Sarah says that she s heard multiple names thrown out at camp , which pushes Tai into ultimate freak-out mode , because the only name he heard all day was Sandra . Tai whispers a new plan to Sandra and Jeff before eventually calling his target out loud Ozzy . Again , WHAT IS THIS S T ?! Now the whole tribe is whispering and wondering if they should change plans . Zeke questions Tai s loyalty . Sandra and Jeff tell Andrea and Ozzy they ll vote with them . It s a mess . But for a brief moment , it seems like Sandra has managed to work her way out of another sticky situation . Is Tai about to be voted out while holding TWO idols , James Clement style ? Or is he going to end up playing an idol and Ozzy will be blindsided ? Unfortunately , neither of those things happens . Instead , all but two votes land on Sandra , sentencing her to her first-ever torch snuffing . Sandra , for the first time in 94 days , the tribe has spoken , Probst says as her tribemates serenade her with a round of applause . A mark of respect for a Survivor legend . Now we re one episode away from the merge , and this season is looking bleak . Those All-Stars fears I had back in the premiere are becoming more of a reality by the week . Just look at who we ve lost so far Ciera , Tony , Malcolm , JT , Sandra . Those are some of the biggest names in Survivor history easily some of the most iconic players in this cast . Only Cirie and Ozzy remain who fit into that legendary bracket . The merge could be a hard slog . A Final Ode To Sandra Putting aside all Sandra s game accomplishments , the best thing about the queen is her personality . She is n t the archetypal Survivor winner . She s not physically imposing or this mega challenge beast . She is n t the Harvard-educated nerd who studied game theory . Nor is she the flirtatious bikini babe . She s this lippy , fish-destroying , hat-burning , Russell-hating , no-nonsense Hispanic momma who trips over her own feet and ca n t win a challenge to save her life . Even in her first season , Pearl Islands , when she was only 28 , she still seemed like the mom of the tribe albeit the cool mom that cursed and let you bum cigarettes . Sandra was n t plucked from central casting she is a real salt of the earth , hardworking woman who CAN GET LOUD TOO , WTF ?! Yet it was her bluntness that allowed her to succeed within the game . She was deceptively honest or should that be honestly deceptive ? She used her reputation as a straight-shooter to craft lies ( and they were good lies ! ) that spared her on multiple occasions . Sandra did n t care who went home and when yes she had preferred targets , but she was always able to read a situation and move with the flow of the game . Her motto as long as it ai n t me became a blueprint for how to win the game for herself and many future players . But last night , it was her . I think I did good for 16 days , considering I m a two-time winner , Sandra said in her heartfelt exit confessional . I know why I live the life that I live , and it s because of Survivor . There will never be another two-time winner except the queen . Adios , Queen Sandra . Players of the Week Zeke : I m still confused over what exactly went down at that tribal council .

		"paragraph": "At New York Comic-Con last week , Pacific Rim : Uprising announced itself as a giant-sized 2018 blockbuster after premiering an all-new trailer that brought the crowd to its feet by spotlighting plenty of Jaeger vs. Kaiju action . Chatting with Yahoo Entertainment backstage after the NYCC panel , Uprising star and producer John Boyega revealed that several drafts of the trailer were required before arriving at the one that got the audience so pumped . We had so many versions , he explains . It was always about deciding , â€˜ What is the appeal ? â€˜ What do the fans want to see ? It was a long way to get to what we ended up doing . It s worth noting that Boyega s producer credit on Pacific Rim : Uprising which is set 10 years after the original 2013 film , directed by Guillermo del Toro is no mere vanity label . The British actor is playing an active role in every step of the creative process , up to and including the sequel s marketing roll-out . Fortunately , he s had plenty of schooling in that department thanks to his role in the relaunched Star Wars franchise . From The Force Awakens to Rogue One to The Last Jedi , the current keepers of George Lucas s space saga including Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams have proven remarkably adept at selling fresh episodes to the public . It s no accident , for example , that the new trailer for The Last Jedi has topped 120 million views and inspired countless dissections since premiering Oct. 9 . Boyega confirms without hesitation that he consciously used Star Wars as a reference point in building the best possible trailer for Pacific Rim . Oh , 100 percent . The strategy in marking has always been important for me , because I find that in the age of social media where people can respond and react [ immediately ] , you have to make sure you describe as much of the experience as possible in the trailer . That s why people pay for a ticket . With that goal in mind , Boyega and the Universal marketing team cut a variety of trailers that chased a variety of tones . The actor says that some of those earlier versions were more character-centric , with one them emphasizing the role of Mako Mori ( Rinko Kikuchi ) , the breakout fan favorite of the first film who serves as the generational bridge to this one . Ultimately , the decision was made to keep that character in reserve for subsequent teasers , which explains why she s only glimpsed in two shots of the finished trailer . We wanted to keep her involvement secret , says Boyega . But we knew she had to come back . We felt we owed it to the fans to explain what is to come , emphasize that this movie is fun , and give them details how the two movies connect . It took an early screening of film to set the trailer on the path to becoming the one shown at NYCC . Uprising helmer Steve S. DeKnight remembers showing his unfinished director s cut to the Universal marketing team , trying to keep his nerves under control as they watched the action play out without completed effects . They came out of that screening with a lightbulb moment , he says , breathing a sigh of relief . Three or four weeks later , they showed me a new pass that for all intents and purposes was this trailer . It really reflects what the movie is , which is fun and exciting . I remember going , â€˜ Yes , I think that will do quite well ! â€˜ Yahoo Entertainment was present for the trailer s NYCC premiere , and can confirm that it did indeed go over quite well . One moment that proved particularly popular was a shot of Boyega s character , Jake Pentecost the son of Idris Elba s apocalypse-canceling General Pentecost from the previous film busting out his Jaeger s signature weapon : a plasma sword . Asked which energy-based blade is more fun to yield , a plasma sword or a lightsaber , the actor lets loose a hearty laugh . I ca n t believe that I ve done both ! The plasma sword is big when you swing that , it s not just your strength coming out , it s also the robot s . And if you ve seen the trailer , you ll notice we ve got two of those babies . When I saw the first film , I was like , â€˜ Why do n t they put in another one ? ' Behold the power that comes with being a producer .

READ MORE : Guardiola must tackle City s alarming complacency READ MORE : Guardiola helpless as Lyon shock Man City It involved a cartoon of Toure , mocked up as an African witchdoctor , poking a voodoo doll of Guardiola . At best it could be described as bitter , at worse racially insensitive . The tweet did not go down well with fans on Twitter who accused Seluk of being petulant and childish . You are proper odd mate , said one response while others pleased with him to respect the club and leave Yaya out of it . Seluk and Toure both believe Guardiola forced the player out after his arrival in 2016 , with the midfielder since claiming the Spaniard had an agenda against African players . And I m sure that many African shamans in the future will not allow Guardiola to win the Champions League , Seluk said in June , per the Mirror . He turned all Africa against himself , many African fans turned away from Manchester City . This will be for Guardiola an African curse . Life will show whether I am right or not . Toure , 35 and now back at Olympiakos , won the FA Cup and the Premier League twice during his time at City , as well as countless individual awards , including African Player of the Year and two inclusions in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year . Guardiola , who was watching from the stands at the Etihad as he was serving a touchline ban , watched his side go two goals down to Lyon before Bernardo Silva pulled back a consolation .

President Donald Trump was widely criticized for his response , in which he condemned bigotry on many sides . Oliver was quick to say , â€˜ On many sides ? This was a white nationalist rally . You have to call that out by name . There are n t many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think , â€˜ That guy really should have mentioned the Nazis , but this is emphatically one of them . Although Trump may not have mentioned white nationalists in his statement , they were more than happy to applaud their chosen leader at the rally . Nazi sympathizer David Duke said , We re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump . That s what we believed in . That s why we voted for Donald Trump . He said he is going to take our country back , and that s what we got ta do . Oliver quipped , Hey , David Duke and the Nazis really seem to like Donald Trump , which is weird because Nazis are a lot like cats : If they like you , it s probably because you re feeding them . Oliver went on to say there was no point waiting for leadership from President Trump because it was clearly not coming . When Trump was asked by a reporter if he wanted white nationalist support , he simply walked out of the room . His silence spoke volumes . Oliver pointed out the problem with that : A non-answer in a moment like this is an answer .

During the Crimson Tide s spring game Saturday , Saban was picked up by a hot mic criticizing Hurts decision-making after a play . Saban was upset after Hurts left the pocket to run instead of throwing a pass . The play picked up 26 yards , but that did n t stop Saban from venting his frustrations . Unfortunately for him , he may have voiced his displeasure a little too close to one of the broadcast microphones . The third team QB Saban references is Mac Jones , who put up better numbers than Hurts during the game . Hurts finished the day 10 for 37 , with 195 yards . He failed to throw a touchdown and was picked off once . Jones wound up sharing MVP honors , throwing for 289 yards , with two touchdowns to one interception during the game . For what it s worth , Saban told reporters he was n t disappointed in Hurts play after the game . Hurts is n t competing with Jones for Alabama s starting job . He s competing with Tua Tagovailoa , who led the team s comeback in the national championship game . Tagovailoa did not play in the spring game due to an injured finger .

It s the latter vein in which he ll be working with this weekend s The Equalizer 2 , the first sequel of his long and illustrious career , which will find him revisiting the character of Robert McCall for another tale of urban vigilante justice . And as he tells Jamie Foxx in the latest episode of Off Script ( presented on Yahoo Entertainment by Grey Goose ) , that s really him on-screen pulling off those hand-to-hand combat moves . I do a lot of them , Washington informs Foxx during their amusing sit-down ahead of Friday s release of The Equalizer 2 . While Washington lets it be known that he s not going so far as to jump off buildings , the actor is nonetheless confident that the follow-up which features a finale set in a hurricane is going to please fans , if early word he s heard is any indication . Everybody that s seen it says that it s better than the first . While McCall is a role that seems tailor-made for Washington s charismatic and imposing presence , he tells Foxx that he has let a few choice parts pass him including one that especially bugged him at the time . I turned down Seven , he says with a grimace on his face . Offered the young-cop character that was eventually played by Brad Pitt , he confesses , I thought the script was too demonic ! Then I saw the movie , and I was like , â€˜ Ah , I blew it .

		"paragraph": " It s a part of me , but I want to be known as an actor first , says 15-year-old Coby Bird . It , in this case , is autism . April is Autism Awareness Month , and Coby is telling Yahoo Entertainment about being an actor , an actor who just so happens to have autism . Coby , who has appeared on the TV shows Speechless and The Good Doctor , explains that he was much less verbal when he was younger . I only had three-word sentences , he says , offering examples : Red car , blue car . I want this , I want that . Again , again . He d also often wear headphones wherever he went so that unfamiliar sounds would n t overwhelm him . At school , these differences resulted in bullying from classmates . They would always pick on me and diss me , he says . They would try and find these flaws I had and try to make fun of them . Coby was eventually homeschooled by his mom and became involved with the Miracle Project , an organization that describes itself as a fully inclusive theatre , film , and expressive arts program for children , teens , and adults with autism and all abilities . There he dove headlong into acting , an interest that was first piqued by the 1985 classic The Goonies ( his favorite characters are Mouth and Chunk ) . As he grew more at ease on the stage and , in turn , offstage Coby picked up an agent and started booking roles . First , a bit part in an episode of ABC s Speechless . Then , last year , a much juicier role on The Good Doctor , the ABC show starring Freddie Highmore as the brilliant autistic doctor Shaun Murphy . In the episode , Coby plays a patient named Liam who arrives at the hospital with a mysterious injury . Further complicating things is the fact that Liam speaks only a few words at a time and is frequently overwhelmed by unfamiliar stimuli . Sound familiar ? Coby explains how he mined his own traumatic past to play an autistic character , saying , I used everything from as a child and made that the persona of Liam . He continues , Most people who do n t have autism and get roles for characters who do have autism have to look up research and everything . But I do n t have to because that s my entire life . Which brings up an interesting question : Why are non-autistic actors getting parts playing people who are autistic ? I think there should be more roles for people with autism , says Coby . While praising Highmore s performance and accuracy on The Good Doctor , Coby outlines the main problem with these kinds of castings . They do n t understand [ autism ] because they never had it , he says . Even though they go through research â€¦ they never went through it . As for Coby , his dream role might surprise you . It is n t something out of Shakespeare or the latest buzzy Star Wars character , he simply wants to play a non-autistic character . It would be important , he says . [ It would show ] I can go beyond the boundary , he says . I love playing characters with autism , because I m sharing a message , but being a character who does n t [ have autism ] would show kids with autism they can do it too . I want to show people that we can also do this . And to any doubters , or casting agents for that matter , Coby is ready for his next big part whatever that may be . I can do this , he said . Put my autism aside and see what my skills are , see what I can do . Watch the Oscar-winning writer of Rain Man explain why he gave away the prized statuette :",

We thought someone showing up uninvited to a carefully planned dinner party is a host s worst nightmare . But that social snafu is next level when that unexpected guest is the man you think tried to poison you a few days earlier , as it was for Claire and Jamie in the latest episode of Outlander . Their newly acquired adversary Le Comte St. Germain arrived at their first foray into French society with their old frenemy the Duke of Sandringham . As it turns out , their feast , which was an elaborate ruse to get Prince Charles to act a fool by exposing his affair with Louise de Rohan and her surprise pregnancy , was foiled by a whole different drama unfolding in the foyer . But it looks like the Comte might find a way to use the abrupt and controversial end of the festivities to his unscrupulous advantage . Yahoo TV picked the brain of the man behind the wig , Stanley Weber , about the new bad guy in the Sassenach s life ( and how he was inspired by the old one , Black Jack ) , what might be next in his plan to make our heroes pay a price for costing him his boat in the Season 2 premiere , and his thoughts on theories that he might also be from the very future the Frasers are trying to save .

Rumor has it you first auditioned for another part , but producers asked you back for St. Germain . What part did you first try for , and why do you think Germain was ultimately the better choice for you?For Louis XV , the king . I do n t know why they thought of me for this part more than the other one , but I am glad they called me back . I take every part that has been given to me as gifts , as jewels . I think the Comte St. Germain has a little more to do and a little more contact with the two leads . Not that the king does n t , but he is so above the other characters . He is playing in another zone . St. Germain is very interesting because he is a real enemy for Claire and Jamie . How would you describe the character to someone who has not seen the show or read the books?He is a business man , a wine merchant . He is ready and capable of anything to achieve his goals . And if the job requires him to be really nasty , then he s got ta do it . He is smart and elegant and desires success . Do you see him as a villain as the fans do?Everyone asks me how it is to play such a villain , such a baddie , but as far as I am concerned in my head and in my skin when I play him , I do not feel like a baddie . He is just a human being who was wronged . The most important thing to do as an actor is to find the humanity in every single character you play , no matter how horrendously bad he is going to behave , so that the audience can find him believable . But as Stanley , I know he is a villain . He s so bad . When you read the book or the scripts and when you watch the TV show , you see him as the enemy of the heroes Claire and Jamie and you acknowledge that he is doing outrageously bad things . But on the other hand , he is attractive : I really admire the freedom of bad guys . They have no limits , no boundaries . They do whatever they need to do to achieve their goals , and that is admirable in a way . Everyone has a dark side . He just embraces his . Tobias Menzies says the same thing : He likes playing Frank , but he loves the challenge of going to the dark side as Black Jack . It is so much fun to be bad . It brings me so much joy to play someone with the absolute freedom of nastiness . When you see Tobias work , you can only be inspired . After watching Season 1 , I was amazed by the amount of humanity he brought to Jack Randall . I was impressed by how attached and attracted he made the audience to such a bad guy . That proves he is doing his job well , and that s what keeps the audience interested . If you are only bad , the audience wo n t care if they get rid of you . Tobias adds so much depth to him . I am trying to find those things to make people feel for the Comte , or at least be interested in learning more about him . Related : ' Outlander Costume Designer Terry Dresbach Talks Claire s Red Dress Moment Sometimes fans take the villain thing too seriously and start treating the actor who brings that character to life poorly . How has your fan experience been ? Any weird encounters , mail or social media posts?Not yet . I am not looking forward to that really . That could be interesting as an experience , but so far the experience has been so great . The fans are invested and so keen and kind . I am feeling once again very grateful for all the warm and welcoming words I have received over the last few months . Were you nervous to join an established show with a tight-knit group of actors ? To be the new guy?Now that the show is on , all I remember is the fun I had on set and how all the people I got to work with were so passionate and nice . But I was very anxious and nervous when I got the job . I hate the first day on set . They re the worst . You do n t know what to expect or what you are doing . But Sam [ Heughan ] and Cait [ Caitriona Balfe ] were the first people I had a scene with and they are the most adorable people and really passionate and really skilled actors . I met with Cait first thing in the morning , and she gave me a hug . I was hypnotized by her beauty , but that was an adorable thing she did to make me feel confident and welcome . Everyone on the crew and the cast made me feel like I d made the right decision to join this family . There is nothing easier than doing the job in those conditions . You uncover and explore a lot of emotional areas doing this job , so it is important to feel safe and comfortable to try things . Acting is best when it is done as a unit , and from day one that is the feeling I got working at Outlander . We got along so well . I miss those two , that lad and lassie . On the run from one enemy , Claire basically makes a new one in the Comte when she diagnoses your sailors with smallpox , which leads to the ship being set ablaze and costing you a pretty penny , or should we say , franc . You vowed that both Claire and Jamie will pay a price . Then we see you in the apothecary s shop and you throw shade . Next thing we know , someone attempts to poison Claire and then attacks her in an alley . Is he out to get them as he promised , or just a too obvious scapegoat?That would be a bit of a shame to let you know if he is guilty right now . That is up to you really . The Comte is too clever to be discovered right away , but it would make absolute sense to think it was him who poisoned Claire . He has every good reason to have his revenge on her . It is really extreme to poison someone , but it is also really extreme to burn someone s boat . It is her fault . She cost him a lot of money and his boat . The Comte St. Germain does n t care about his crew . He cares about his merchandise . It is the most heartbreaking thing to watch your boat full of very expensive wine on fire because of this one woman who opened her mouth about smallpox . I was about to make a deal with the harbormaster , but she arrived and she ruined everything . So in his head , he has every good reason to be vengeful . Given that he is not their fan , why do you think he agreed to attend the Fraser dinner party ? Psychological warfare?There is probably a little bit of that , but let me remind you that there is someone around the table who is very important and powerful the prince Charlie . Speaking of getting in someone s head , let s talk about that glorious wig of yours . I have had wigs before , and this one is one of the most comfortable . Massive thanks to the team who worked on them and would set them up on my head . It is a costume on its own . It says so much about the character . It tells everyone that he is elegant and noble and wealthy so I do n t even have to play that . Just putting it on does a big part of my job . Related : ' Outlander Postmortem : Sam Heughan Talks Toilet Humor Can you tease what s coming up for Le Comte ? We do see him leave with the prince . Is he working an angle?The prince is a very important person and the Comte is very attracted to power . He is striving to have a very wealthy business , and he sees getting close to the prince as a way to expand his business and gain more power for himself . You can definitely expect interactions between those four . Jamie is n t going to let it go that someone tried to poison his wife and then attacked her and her friends . He is going to keep trying to prove that I planned those things , and he may have to deal with me if I become close to his prince . Some folks speculate that he knows more than he is letting on about Claire , perhaps even that he may be similar to Geilis or Claire . Care to comment on that ? Do you hope that he is a time traveler ? Look , I have heard about this theory as well , but I chose to keep it in my head as a mystery . I think it is important for the audience to figure it out on their own and for the truth to come out in its own time . I think there is definitely a connection going on internally when I am looking at Master Raymond or at Claire . But who knows what it is . Do I hope he is a traveler ? Yes , if that means I get to come back and do some more Outlander . I personally do n t know if he is , but I think it is a very exciting prospect . Outlander airs Saturdays at 9 p.m. on Starz .",

		"paragraph": "SPOILER ALERT : There are none . Sure , give us and our fellow Walking Dead devoted another week to Zapruder the heck out of the newly-released Season 7 trailer , and there will be plenty of theories floating around about who s on the receiving end of Negan and Lucille . But at first glance , the trailer , released by AMC for The Walking Dead cast panel at San Diego Comic-Con , is maddeningly devoid of major or minor , for that matter hints as to which beloved character will die at the hand of Negan and his barbed wire-covered baseball bat . Clocking in at a generous 3:06 , the trailer s first half is devoted to some blasts from the past , as we relive snippets of meaningful moments with Rick Grimes and his crew . Related : Norman Reedus on His New Restaurant and â€˜ The Walking Dead Season 7 Premiere There s Rick and Cor-al ( aka Carl ) , exchanging I love yous â€¦ Maggie telling Glenn he ll never need a photo to remember her ( and smooching him ) â€¦ Daryl giving Carol the Cherokee rose and holding Lil Asskicker â€¦ Abe and Sasha bonding â€¦ Michonne pledging her allegiance to Rick s group ( and smooching him ) â€¦ Eugene and Abe bro-hugging â€¦ all recalled in between scenes of those characters with Lucille right in their faces , as Negan carried out his vicious game of Eenie , Meenie , Miney , Moe from the Season 6 finale . The second half of the clip for Season 7 which will premiere on Oct. 23 at 9 p.m. features none of the characters from the first half of the clip , i.e. none of the potential victims . So , unless Negan wiped out half the cast we kid , we kid ! the first half of the clip is an unhappy reminder of that which we have seen , while the second half of the trailer focuses on that which we have yet to see â€¦ and those who we have yet to meet . Like Ezekiel and Shiva , who TWD comic book fans know as the dreadlocked leader of The Kingdom community , and his pet tiger . Ezekiel , who will be played by General Hospital , Teen Titans , and Transformers : Robots in Disguise star Khary Payton , hates Negan and the Saviors as much as Rick and his friends are about to , which might make for some much-needed new allies for the Alexandria community . Also in the comics , Ezekiel , who likes to be called King Ezekiel , is a pal of Jesus and the Hilltop community , making a Rick/Ezekiel pact all but a certainty , as long as the egos of the King and the Ricktatorship do n t butt heads . Elsewhere in part two of the Season 7 trailer : * Ezekiel may insist on being called King , but it s Negan we see people literally bowing to in the trailer . * In addition to The Kingdom , we also get glimpses of the Saviors hangout . * Morgan and Carol might already be laying the groundwork for a We Hate Negan club , as Morgan is seen pushing the injured Carol around The Kingdom in a wheelchair . * Dwight , that old so-and-so who s already caused so much trouble for Daryl ( and Denise , R.I.P. ) , promises Everything s his , or will be , in reference to Negan , while a new female character ( or wait , is that Daryl s other nemesis , Honey ? ) issues considering what we know he already did a truly frightening warning when she says , Whatever he s done to you , there s always more . * Spencer tells someone , We should have made a deal with them when we could have . Presumably , he s talking about Negan and the Saviors , and presumably , this is going to make more than a few of his fellow citizens of Alexandria want to kick his apocalyptic ass for a ) suggesting they should have negotiated with Negan , and b ) second-guessing the Ricktatorship . * Enid is out and about , so she clearly found a way out of that closet Carl locked her in . * Tara and Heath s supply run may have taken a bad turn , as we briefly see him , and separately , her , hiding in a ditch with her knife ready to stab . Since Heath portrayer Corey Hawkins will be starring in 24 : Legacy on Fox , that might be a hint that the supply run continues to go badly . * Negan is seen pouring a nice glass of lemonade while a terrified Olivia looks on , and he later tells someone , You should know , there is no door number four â€¦ this is the only way . This might come after we see him knocking on the Alexandria gates with Lucille . We see a pair of pigs who appear to be chomping on a dead body . Let s hope they do n t hear about what Rick did to their brethren at the prison in Season 4 . * A giddy-seeming Carol ( think : Carol in cookie-baking mode at Alexandria ) appears to be sitting in an auditorium when she tells someone , I do n t know what the hell s going on , in the most wonderful way . Has Carol finally cracked , or has she resumed her Cardigan Carol role during her time in The Kingdom ? Also on The Walking Dead Comic-Con Day , AMC announced a pair of specials that will air before the Season 7 premiere : The Walking Dead Season 7 Preview Special , hosted by Chris Hardwick , will premiere Aug. 14 at 10 p.m. , while the two-hour The Walking Dead Recap Special a reminder of all that has happened in the series first six seasons will also be hosted by Hardwick and will debut on Oct. 16 at 9 p.m. , a week before we finally find out whose blood is dripping from Negan s bat in the trailer .

		"paragraph": "The New York Times managed to take the media s eye off Bob Woodward s bombshell book about Donald Trump s White House this afternoon which is saying a lot when it published an op-ed penned by an anonymous Trump staffer . I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration , the op-ed is headlined . The senior staffer writes that some in the White House and the administration are working to thwart POTUS s worst impulses . This mirrors the leitmotif of Woodward s book Fear : Trump in the White House that senior administration officials are trying to protect the United States from Donald Trump . The dilemma which he does not fully grasp is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations , the anonymous staffer wrote . We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous , the official continues . But we believe our first duty is to this country , and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic . That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump s more misguided impulses until he is out of office , The root of the problem , the staffer said , is the president s amorality . Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making . President Trump s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic , the author held , including his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the â€˜ enemy of the people , the staffer wrote . Do n t get me wrong . There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture , the op-ed writer claims , citing effective deregulation , historic tax reform , a more robust military and more . But these successes have come despite not because of the president s leadership style , which is impetuous , adversarial , petty and ineffective . Meetings with Trump veer off topic and off the rails , the author says , adding that Trump engages in repetitive rants , and his impulsiveness results in half-baked , ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back . There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next , the op-ed writer claimed , citing another anonymous top official . With his preference for autocrats and dictators , and little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied , like-minded nations , the writer confirmed Trump was reluctant to expel so many of Putin s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Great Britain , and frustrated the country continued to impose sanctions on Russia for its behavior . But his national security team knew these actions had to be taken to hold Moscow accountable . This is n t the work of the so-called deep state . It s the work of the steady state , the op-ed states . The Trump staffer acknowledged the instability many witnessed in Trump and revealed there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment , which would start a complex process for removing the president . But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis . So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or another it s over .

The report notes that personal wealth in India would grow to $ 5 trillion from the current $ 3 trillion by 2022 . Here are the details . Personal wealth : India 's personal financial wealth is growing , and it 's growing fast The report observes that India 's personal financial wealth has grown at a compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 12 % since 2012 , and the growth rate is expected to be 13 % between 2018 and 2022 . Notably , this makes India the only nation in the world after China to have a double digit CAGR for personal financial wealth . Fact : The BCG report 's predictions about US and China The US will still retain the top position , with its personal wealth growing to $ 100 trillion by 2022 from the current $ 80 trillion . China 's personal wealth , on the other hand , is expected to double touch $ 43 trillion from the current $ 21 trillion by 2022 . Individuals : India has an increasing number of wealthy individuals Delving into details , the report notes that India has an increasing number of increasingly wealthy individuals . It points out that India currently has over 320,000 people with wealth up to $ 1mn , 87,000 high net worth individuals ( HNWI ) with wealth in the range of $ 1mn and $ 20mn , and around 4,000 ultra high net worth individuals ( UHNWI ) with personal fortunes valued above $ 20mn . Re-investment : Vast opportunities await wealth managers The report also noted that this vast increase in personal wealth would provide massive opportunities for wealth managers . According to BCG , nearly 70 % of India 's personal financial wealth would be available for re-investment by wealth managers and wealth management firms by 2022 , up from 67 % last year . The re-investable wealth would be in the for of listed equity , bonds , investment funds , currency , deposits , etc . Opportunity : Indian banks are n't doing enough to capitalize on the opportunity Yet , despite this opportunity , BCG notes that Indian banks are n't doing enough to capitalize on it . According to Anna Zakrzewski , partner and director , BCG Zurich , Indian banks have access to a ton of data in terms of behaviour , investments , life cycles , and more , but currently , they only use \" just 25 % -30 % \" of this data . If this data can be leveraged , a lot can be gained .",

		"paragraph": "Scott Frost s Nebraska team has done something that has n t been done in a long , long time in Lincoln . No , that thing is not good . Nebraska lost Saturday to Troy 24-19 to fall to 0-2 . It s the first time a Nebraska team has started the season 0-2 since 1957 . That team went 1-9 in William Jennings first season as Nebraska coach . When you combine the 0-2 start with four-straight losses to end the 2017 season , it s also the first time Nebraska has lost six-straight games since , you guessed it , 1957 . There are a few caveats to Nebraska s 2018 futility . The team s first game of the season against Akron was canceled because of thunderstorms . That probably would have been a win . And dynamic quarterback Adrian Martinez suffered a knee injury late in a Week 2 loss to Colorado . He missed Saturday s game , meaning walk-on backup Andrew Bunch was forced to start the game . But let s be real . Nebraska should n t be losing to Troy . Just like it should n t have lost to Northern Illinois at home in Week 3 in 2017 . That loss dropping the Huskers to 1-2 led to the firing of athletic director Shawn Eichorst later that week . Coach Mike Riley was fired after the season . There wo n t be firings in Lincoln after Saturday . Nor should there be . But the first two weeks of Nebraska s season are a wakeup call to Husker fans that Frost and his staff are going to need some time to get the program going . Troy got inside the Nebraska 5 with less than eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter on a run by quarterback Kaleb Barker . But it was called back for a hold and Troy was forced into a 1st and 15 at the Nebraska 26 . That was absolutely no problem . Barker handed the ball off to B.J. Smith who ran through a crater-sized hole in the middle of the Nebraska defense untouched for his second touchdown of the day . The Troy TD put the Trojans in front 24-13 . Nebraska got a touchdown with less than three minutes to go but Bunch overthrew his receiver on the two-point conversion . Troy went three-and-out after Nebraska s touchdown , but Nebraska s final drive lasted two plays . Bunch was intercepted off a tipped pass . Troy simply ran out the clock the rest of the way . Bunch finished the game 19-27 passing for 177 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions . With Tristan Gebbia s transfer , he ll be the guy until Martinez is healthy enough to play . The win is a big bounceback for Troy , one of the top teams in the Sun Belt . The Trojans were beaten soundly by Boise State at home in Week 1 Nick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "Three top Chinese financial regulators spoke in support of local markets on Friday , just ahead of the morning 's disappointing gross domestic product report and amid an ongoing stock sell-off . All three statements were transcripts of interviews with media , according to postings on each government organization 's website . \" The recent stock market volatility is primarily the result of investor expectations and emotions , \" said the Chairman of the People 's Bank of China , Yi Gang , according to a CNBC translation . China 's economic fundamentals are good , in contrast to the historically low valuations in the stock market , Yi added . The central bank \" actively encourages \" some local governments ' policies to support the liquidity of businesses based there , and is promoting plans to support equity and bond financing of private enterprises , he said . The Shanghai composite is trading near four-year lows , hit by worries about economic slowdown , increasing trade tensions with the U.S. China 's largest trading partner and a global market sell-off in the last few weeks . The index ended Friday 's morning session little changed after China reported third-quarter gross domestic product of 6.5 percent , its weakest since 2009 and missing expectations of 6.6 percent from a Reuters poll of analysts . The country remains on pace to meet its official growth target of roughly 6.5 percent . Chinese President Xi Jinping 's top economic advisor Liu He said in an interview Friday published by state news agency Xinhua that the stock market slump is due partly to the U.S-China trade tensions and other external factors . Liu also attributed the decline to China 's economic transition and economic uncertainty , but that the sell-off could be good for the stock market 's healthy long-term development . China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Liu Shiyu said in a separate statement that the commission has maintained a baseline of financial market reform , opening up innovation as it seeks to stabilize and boost market confidence . \" [ We will ] encourage local government-managed funds , qualified private equity investment funds , broker-managed products or newly organized funds , to help relieve the stock pledge difficulties of public companies with good prospects but are temporarily facing operational difficulties , so they can develop healthily , \" Liu said . China 's retail investor-dominated stock market tends to be less correlated to economic growth . But the private companies that are listed have been finding it difficult to get funding , since banks prefer to lend to state-owned enterprises and Beijing has been cracking down on off-balance sheet loans . As a result , many companies have been turning to \" share pledge financing , \" in which equity is used to obtain loans . If the share price falls drastically below a certain agreed-upon level , the lender will sell the stocks to obtain funds . Nomura estimates the ratio of outstanding pledged shares in the mainland Chinese A-share market is about 8.9 percent in the third quarter , down from a peak of 10.4 percent in the first quarter of 2016 . Guo Shuqing , chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission , said insurance funds can establish special-purpose products to alleviate the liquidity risk of listed companies ' stock pledges . The commission also released a draft of new regulations on Friday that could allow bank 's wealth management subsidiaries to directly invest in stocks . \" Recently , due to various factors , China 's financial market has experienced a large number of abnormal fluctuations , which is seriously out of touch with the fundamentals of China 's economic development and inconsistent with the overall soundness of China 's financial system , \" Guo said . The Shanghai composite rose more than a quarter of a percent when markets reopened for afternoon trading , with information technology leading advancers , up about 2 percent . The index is down more than 4 percent for the week , and more than 24 percent so far this year .",

However , in a suit filed this week in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas , Tornetta claims that he was beaten , falsely arrested , and the victim of intense media criticism . As a result , he alleges that he has suffered physical pain , discomfort , trauma , humiliation , embarrassment , emotional distress , sleeplessness , anxiety , inability to perform simple activities of daily living , depression characterized by feelings of despair , hopelessness , and despondency . He is seeking damages of more than $ 50,000 . Tornetta claims that he was simply pregaming with hundreds of other fans when suddenly , without warning or notice , police on horseback swept into the group and grabbed him , tearing his shirt . He charged that he was struck with a baton and forced to lay facedown on the ground , bleeding , while he was handcuffed . Is there video . It s 2018 , what do you think ? Here s video of the , uh , festivities before the game , with rowdy fans , police , and police horses all involved . Please be aware there is salty language in this clip this is Philly , after all , where there s salty language in baby shower videos . Anyway , check this lunacy out : Well , the Eagles won the Super Bowl . They re named in the suit because they allegedly failed to supervise the police . As for Tornetta , his charges of resisting arrest , disorderly conduct , and failure to disperse were withdrawn after he finished community service and paid $ 222 worth of court fees , according to the Philly Inquirer . Great question . But get this : this was the second time in a week that an Eagles fan allegedly punched a horse . A 22-year-old fan apparently punched a horse prior to the Eagles division-round win over the Falcons . What s going on there , Philly ? Jay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank were feeling the love on their royal wedding day ! In a newly-released black-and-white photo taken after their romantic carriage ride through the streets of Windsor , the newlyweds share a sweet kiss in the back of the Scottish State Coach . The longtime couple exchanged vows in front of 800s guests in St. George s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Friday . After they said their I dos , they had their first kiss as husband and wife on the steps of the chapel in front of gathered fans . Their wedding photographer , Alex Bramall , snapped their second candid kiss upon the couple s return to Windsor Castle following their carriage procession . Three other stunning portraits were also released on Saturday . Due to the blustery weather on Friday , the couple decided against an open-top State Landau carriage like the one Prince Harry and Meghan Markle used for their royal wedding , and instead left in a carriage with a roof . Eugenie , 28 , and Jack , 32 , shared several romantic moments on their wedding day . As Eugenie entered the chapel alongside her father , Jack made sure he had his glasses on so that he could see his bride perfectly as she made her way down the aisle . Once she reached him at the end of the altar , he removed the tortoise shell frames and handed them over to his best man , his brother Thomas , and kept them off for the remainder of the ceremony . During their luncheon reception hosted by the Queen in Windsor Castle , Jack gave a heartwarming speech , thanking guests for coming . He even shared a sweet hug with his new father-in-law , Prince Andrew . And as the newlyweds made their way to their private evening reception at Royal Lodge , he gave his bride a true Hollywood moment when he surprised her with their getaway car : an Aston Martin DB10 made to film the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre , starring Daniel Craig . Eugenie saw it and immediately said , Wow ! ",

		"paragraph": "Jennifer Lopez can do almost anything . She can dance she can sing she can assess the vocal talents of Denver teens she can exude more star quality than a luminous sphere of hot plasma careening through an expanding universe . What Jennifer Lopez can NOT do is portray a character that is not Jennifer Lopez . Just look at her acting resume : What began with immersive character work in things like Out of Sight and Selena and especially In Living Color suddenly became a laundry list of hilarious miscastings where Jennifer Lopez tried and failed to portray ordinary folks . Jennifer Lopez as an FBI agent in The Cell ? Nope . Jennifer Lopez as a hotel worker in Maid in Manhattan ? Absolutely not . Jennifer Lopez as an ordinary suburban mom in The Boy Next Door ? Still LOL-ing . The sad truth is , Jennifer Lopez has n t seemed real since I m Real , and while it s not exactly an insult Jennifer Lopez is AMAZING as herself her star quality is VERY distracting when it comes to her new NBC cop show , Shades of Blue . Related : â€˜ Shades of Blue Review : JLo Gets Low-Down I m definitely not saying that glamorous , gorgeous women ca n t be Brooklyn cops . I m merely saying that Jennifer Lopez ca n t be a Brooklyn cop . Her Detective Harlee Santos is meant to be a gritty , headstrong , corrupt cop who gets swept up in an FBI operation to root out the even more corrupt cops in her midst ( including Ray Liotta ) , but really she s just Jennifer Lopez with a frizzy cotton candy hairdo and a cowboy walk . Directed by one of the creators of Homicide : Life on the Street and feeling very much like a brighter-lit network version of The Shield , Shades of Blue desperately wants to be edgy and compelling . On the upside ? Story-wise , it kind of is ! As long as you are willing to believe that a Brooklyn everywoman cop looks like this : 1 ) Like , sure , Jennifer Lopez . That badge on your belt definitely makes us forget that you re Jennifer Lopez . 2 ) In what was supposed to be the pilot episode s first big shocking scene Jennifer Lopez s young partner accidentally shot an unarmed man , so Jennifer Lopez had to arrange the crime scene to get internal affairs off their backs all of the edginess was undone by Jennifer Lopez s flawless skin and bone structure ! It s just kind of hard to be outraged by police corruption when it looks this fabulous . 3 ) Here was Jennifer Lopez having an impromptu chat with her teenage daughter . Because YUP , Shades of Blue ALSO wanted us to believe that Jennifer Lopez could be the mother of a teenage girl . NICE TRY . 4 ) For a minute it appeared as though Jennifer Lopez might actually be serious about her boxing regimen , but her Frederick s of Hollywood unmentionables did not seem very gym appropriate ! Oh , J.Lo . 5 ) Even when Jennifer Lopez was getting grilled by Internal Affairs she was giving such defiant cheekbone action that you could almost hear a four-four dance beat starting to kick in . 6 ) I mean , look at this posture . Jennifer Lopez s biggest acting choice in bringing this cop character to life was putting her hands in her pockets a lot . This might have helped her intimidate local bookies into cutting her in on their profits , but it was not going to convince us that this was n t Jennifer Lopez just striking a pose again . 7 ) Even when after she d been nabbed in an undercover sting and forced to turn evidence against her inner circle of corrupt cop friends , Jennifer Lopez still looked dewy and fierce . Like , come on . 8 ) But cop Jennifer Lopez was n t ONLY about striking power poses and looking slightly mussed in a glam way , she also occasionally stumbled into soft lighting so that she could look proud of her daughter for playing a flute solo or whatever . See , that is the look of a woman who has a lot going on in her life , but those things are mostly to do with sexin on younger backup dancers and maybe trying to decide which private jet to take to Barbados . 9 ) Just as an aside , during this pilot episode I used about 30 percent of my brainpower to follow the storyline and the remaining 70 percent wondering whether Jennifer Lopez was wearing a wig or not . Because if so , it was QUITE a wig ! But if not , wow , credit where credit s due : Jennifer Lopez was getting BRAVE in the Hair and Makeup trailer . 10 ) At one point Jennifer Lopez had to cover up a lie she d told about her daughter getting in a car accident by going out and crashing her daughter s car herself ! And as you can see from the above GIF , Jennifer Lopez shed some tears about what her life had come to . But I think we can agree that she was either thinking about Marc Anthony or just the residual trauma of having to hang out with Steven Tyler for two years . 11 ) You know ? Obviously not a hairdo Jennifer Lopez would have in real life , but that just made it all the more hilarious to see her wearing it . I realize this sounds like I m making fun of Jennifer Lopez or I m saying that she should n t attempt to play blue collar characters . She should ! She s fun to watch in any context . Mariah Carey may have impressively committed to her role in Precious , but I d rather watch her play herself in Glitter any day . Shades of Blue is no Glitter â€¦ It s just a very solid , if poorly timed cop drama ( not sure I want to see good guy cops being openly corrupt for the greater good these days ) which happens to star a woman with an all-consuming star-shine that renders everything around her bleached out and irrelevant . That s more than most other shows have to offer ! I just wish Shades of Blue would get real and rename her character to Jennifer Lopez and recast her partner with Ja Rule . Now THAT would be real . Shades of Blue airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. on NBC .",

Before the game , an image of Arthur standing beside a Christmas tree , being featured on the back of Green s sneakers foreshadowed Golden State s strategy against LeBron James . It was a shoe commissioned by Green weeks in advance of the Christmas Day matchup because what else would he do before a Christmas Day showdown against James besides blow metaphorical spitballs at the back of his neck ? The Arthur fist meme was recently revived by James on Instagram following a Boston Celtics victory and has proliferated within NBA social circles . However , Green is the first opponent to flip it and actively troll James . Green arrived to Oracle Arena with a mission . He had James all over his brain and his feet followed . Green earned a triple-double , but he was the key component of a defensive penumbra that formed over James . Over the course of the evening , Green was superglued to James . He swooped in and swatted a James lay-in underneath the basket in the second quarter . When Green was n t smothering James , he created fast-break opportunities through his shot-blocking prowess . Green was n t alone . Containing James was a group effort . Rookie Jordan Bell also took turns defending James . It went markedly better than this summer s L.A. open gym , in which he discussed getting schooled by James . In the fourth quarter , Durant locked in and frustrated James even further . Overall James finished 7-of-18 from the field , made 2-of-7 treys , dished six assists and committed seven turnovers . On the Cavs penultimate possession , Durant swatted another James lay-up that wound up ricocheting off the four-time MVP s hand . It was the fifth block for Durant , who also scored 25 points on 8-of-19 shooting . That did n t even include Andre Iguodala , who cultivated a career out of causing perimeter scorers to malfunction . Watching James get his drawers strung up a flagpole down the stretch was jarring to witness . Minus Stephen Curry , the Warriors defensive fortitude and their bully-ball lineup was the difference between them and Cleveland s 27th ranked defense . DJ Dunson is a writer for Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "You can forgive Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz for seeming a little fatigued answering the predictable questions about his knee on Monday morning . For about nine minutes , the media covering the Eagles focused on the only theme anyone wants to know about with Wentz right now : How is his knee , and will he start in Week 1 ? Wentz has been answering the same questions since he tore his ACL late last season . And very politely , Wentz gave some version of the same answer for roughly nine minutes . He does n t know . Wentz was cleared for 11-on-11 practice action last week , and that s a great step in his comeback from ACL surgery . But he wo n t play until he is cleared for contact , and Wentz said he did n t know when that will be . The Eagles doctors will make that call . The final hurdle , which will not be my decision , will be being cleared for contact , Wentz said . I feel good . I mean , I think you guys kind of see me out there . I have no hesitation in the pocket when guys are around me , those things . I feel really good . But it s going to come down if they feel confident in contact , and when that is I ca n t say yet . As Wentz was saying it , there were 17 days remaining until the Eagles start the season against the Atlanta Falcons on Sept. 6 . The Eagles get the Thursday night opener as defending champs , and while that s a fantastic position to be in , it also means there is a little less time for Wentz to get ready . It s going to be close , Wentz said about being cleared for Week 1 . The Eagles coaches have maintained they wo n t rush Wentz . It had to be a little scary when Nick Foles suffered a shoulder injury in last week s preseason game , but it does n t appear the injury is n t serious . If Foles is fine , it reduces the pressure to get Wentz back in the lineup for the regular-season opener . The good news is Wentz says he feels good with what he has been able to do in practice . His injury came in December , which meant he had to be on a very tight timetable to even consider a Week 1 return . Everything has been going well , all throughout rehab , just been constant progression . I feel really good where I m at , Wentz said . Given that Wentz was the NFL s breakout star last season and the Eagles are defending Super Bowl champions for the first time , Wentz s return is perhaps the biggest ongoing story in the league right now . As much as everyone wants to know when he ll make his 2018 debut , Wentz remains in wait-and-see mode . Frank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "BERLIN ( Reuters ) - The foreign minister of Canada , which is embroiled in a diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia , called for German support on Monday in Ottawa 's campaign to promote human rights around the world . The German government , trying to repair its own strained relationship with Riyadh , has been silent on the spat between Canada and Saudi Arabia , drawing criticism from some politicians and rights groups . Chrystia Freeland , speaking at an annual gathering of German ambassadors in Berlin , did not specifically mention Saudi Arabia in her address . However , she touched indirectly on the row which was triggered by her tweet demanding the release of jailed human rights activists in the kingdom . In response , Riyadh has frozen new trade with Canada , expelled the Canadian ambassador and ended state-backed educational and medical programs in Canada . Freeland said Canada would always stand up for human rights \" even when we are told to mind our own business ... and even when speaking up brings consequences \" . She added : \" We count on and hope for Germany 's support . \" Ties between Berlin and Riyadh have been strained since former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel denounced \" adventurism \" in the Middle East in November of last year , comments that were seen as criticism of Riyadh 's actions in the region . Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Berlin and , since early 2018 , has excluded German healthcare companies from public tenders . Riyadh is at loggerheads with many European countries which have criticized its intervention in Yemen 's civil war and support dialogue with its arch-enemy Iran . German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stressed at the conference Europe and Canada 's shared interest in preserving a \" rules-based international order \" in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump 's unilateralism . \" It hits Europe and Germany when the United States , suddenly and without consulting , introduces random sanctions against Russia , China , Turkey and in the future perhaps more of our important trading partners , \" he said . Europe needed to become more autonomous in order to defend its commercial and trade interests , Maas said . \" It wo n't be easy , \" he added .

		"paragraph": "From Esquire \" Yet somewhere under starlight or the sun , My father stands.Aged , worn out with warsOn foot on horseback or in battle-cars . I only ask what way my journey lies , For He who made you bitter made you wise . \" -- Cuchulain 's Fight With The Sea , W.B. Yeats WASHINGTON - In the magnificent , lordly church-house , there were speeches and prayers . There were songs and hymns . There were bands and pipers and choirs and soloists . John McCain was given a national send-off in a National Cathedral and there was a great gathering of emotion that was almost frightening in its intensity because you knew that it was aimed at a solitary , angry , unbalanced man left back at the White House , at someone who nonetheless is the president * of the United States , with all the powers inherent to his office , a man who has created a situation in which he is an object of dislike and disrespect , because that is all that he 's given to the world in return . It was said almost immediately after the conclusion of the funeral ceremonies on Saturday that , for a few hours anyway , we were back in a familiar country with familiar customs and manners and norms , a country with institutions built to last . That may well be true . I felt it , too . But in back of that is the realization that all of us , including the deceased , had taken those customs , manners , norms , and institutions terribly for granted . We thought they could withstand anything , even a renegade president * in the pocket of a distant authoritarian goon . We let the customs , manners , norms and institutions weaken through neglect and now we are in open conflict with an elected president and , make no mistake about it , John McCain 's funeral was a counsel of war , and it was a counsel of war because that 's what John McCain meant it to be . He deliberately made known to people that the president * was not welcome at any of the services . He deliberately chose the previous two presidents to deliver the formal eulogies . He deliberately created that scene in the Capitol rotunda at which Mitch McConnell , Paul Ryan , and Mike Pence , an unholy trio of Trumpist quislings , had to choke down their own cowardice and say how much they loved him and his irascibility . He deliberately created a mirror in which , if they still have an ounce of self-awareness , they could see the rot that has set in on their souls . Even at the end , John McCain knew what he was doing and he was a fearsome opponent . He wanted a pageant of everything this administration * has trashed and put up for sale , and that 's what he got Saturday-a morality play shot through with Shakespearian portent and foreshadowing , a pageant of democracy 's vengeance . This is not to minimize the genuine affection and love that was on display . John McCain was a beloved figure to many of the people who came to bid him farewell . But there was so much subtext under the proceedings that the mantle shattered , and subtext became text , plain as the rain that fell and passed while the service continued . This was a funeral with more than one purpose-to celebrate the passing of John McCain and to summon a rebirth of politics that did not so much reek of grift and vodka . Thus said Meghan McCain : And here the transcript reads : ( Applause ) . Thus said George W. Bush , who I believe has a new writer who deserves a raise : And thus said Barack Obama , who confessed to being initially surprised at being asked to speak : Make no mistake . Those are not patriotic banalities any more . The current president * has made them dead serious again . They are no longer frothy paeans to the greatness of America . They are compass points on a battlefield . They are no longer heard with half an ear and then forgotten . They are fighting words now . The president * knew it . That 's why he spent the morning rage-tweeting and the afternoon playing golf . In dying , and in carefully planning his funeral in the way he did , John McCain has opened a second front . In 1998 , when I was traveling with McCain for a profile that ran in this magazine , I asked him if there was anyone involved with the Vietnam War that he could n't bring himself to forgive . By then , he had made his peace with the antiwar movement he delivered the eulogy for an antiwar activist whose speeches from Hanoi had been piped into his cell . He-along with John Kerry-had succeeded in normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam . He had taken Walter Cronkite on a tour of his old prison . He 'd even forgiven the guards who 'd beaten and tortured him . A couple of years earlier , former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , one of the architects of that bloody misadventure , had written a memoir in which he confessed that he 'd known the war was unwindable as early as 1967 , but that he had kept his mouth shut while the country slid more swiftly toward disaster . As it happens , October 26 , 1967 was the day that John McCain 's fighter jet had taken an anti-aircraft missile over Hanoi . So I asked him if there was someone he could n't forgive , or at least talk to , about that awful time . He got all quiet and took a long time to answer . \" McNamara , \" he finally said . \" That 's the worst to me-to know you 've made a mistake and to do nothing to correct it while , year after year , people are dying and to do nothing to stop it , to know what your public duty is and to ignore it . I do n't think any conversation we could have would be helpful now . \" One image will stay with me as this weekend comes to an end and we all walk back into politics as they are now . It was Friday afternoon and various important people were paying their respects in the rotunda , their ranks formed by what they did for a living . Senators with senators . House members with House members . The members of the executive filed in by department . As the members of the Department of Justice paid their respects , Rod Rosenstein , the embattled deputy attorney general who is overseeing Robert Mueller 's investigation , walked by the assembled members of the House of Representatives , and he winked at someone among them . Something inexorable began this weekend , and that 's what John McCain had in mind all along . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

		"paragraph": "8 times Trump slammed ' chain migration ' before it apparently helped wife 's parents become citizens originally appeared on abcnews.go.com President Donald Trump has often slammed the so-called \" chain migration \" process by which Americans help foreign-born relatives gain citizenship . Now it appears his wife Melania Trump helped her parents gain U.S. citizenship through this very process . Sources tell ABC News that the first lady sponsored her parents ' green card application , a step in the process toward their becoming citizens . Melania Trump was born in Slovenia and moved to the United States , eventually gaining citizenship , and on Thursday her Slovenian parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs were granted citizenship as well . Neither the first lady 's office nor the White House has commented on the couple 's becoming citizens . The U.S. allows citizens and permanent legal residents to sponsor certain immediate family members for residency , a process Trump regularly derides as \" chain migration , \" a term that many , including immigration rights advocates and Democrats , view as an anti-immigration slur . ( MORE : Conflicting feelings about ' chain migration ' on display at State of the Union ) The Knavses were eligible for sponsorship by their daughter because she is a U.S. citizen . Citizens may sponsor other types of immediate family members for immigration , such as brothers and sisters , although except for spouses , parents and young children , the numbers they can sponsor are limited . Green card holders , in contrast , may petition only on behalf of spouses and unmarried children . Trump has often called for an end to \" chain migration , \" sometimes blasting it as a security threat . He has repeatedly tied \" chain migration \" to terrorism by citing the case of Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov the suspect charged with killing eight people on Oct. 31 , 2017 , after ramming a truck down the bike path along the West Side Highway in New York City . But Saipov , from Uzbekistan , entered the United States in 2010 through a different process , the diversity visa lottery program , which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States , according to PolitiFact . The fact-checking news outlet also cited multiple news sites ' reporting that Saipov got married in the U.S. in 2013 to a woman who already lived here , also an Uzbek national . Here are eight times Trump has slammed \" chain migration . \" 1 . On Twitter , Sept. 15 , 2017 \" CHAIN MIGRATION can not be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration ! \" he wrote . 2 . During an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News , Oct. 11 , 2017 \" Chain migration is one of the disasters . You allow one person and in that one person brings in 10 or 12 people , \" Trump said to Hannity . 3 . During a Cabinet meeting , and then on Twitter , Nov. 1 , 2017 Trump talked at the Nov. 1 Cabinet meeting about the truck attack in New York by Saipov . \" We do not want chain migration where somebody like him ultimately will be allowed to bring in many , many members of his family . \" PolitiFact rated Trump 's repeated claims that Saipov had sponsored 20 or more people for immigration into the U.S. as false . Green card holders , such as Saipov , are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children . Saipov had three children in the U.S. who are all citizens . And , there are no reports of Saipov , then 29 years old , fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the U.S. , PolitiFact said . Trump 's comments about \" chain migration \" were featured on a video posted on his Twitter account the day after the Cabinet meeting , with the caption : \" Congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is SECURITY BASED ! We need to make AMERICA SAFE ! #USA . \" 4 . During the State of the Union , Jan. 30 , 2018 : \" The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration . Under the current broken system , a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives . Under our plan , we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children . This vital reform is necessary , not just for our economy , but for our security , and for the future of America . In recent weeks , two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration . In the age of terrorism , these programs present risks we can just no longer afford . It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules , and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century , \" he said . 5 . During a weekly address , Feb. 10 , 2018 : \" My administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe , modern , and lawful immigration system : fully securing the border , ending chain migration , and canceling the visa lottery . Chain migration is a disaster , and very unfair to our country . The visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place . People enter a lottery to come into our country . What kind of a system is that ? It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans . \" 6 . During a tax reform roundtable in West Virginia , April 5 , 2018 \" And chain migration -- think of that . So you come in , and now you can bring your family , and then you can bring your mother and your father . You can bring your grandmother . You can bring your this you can bring -- we had somebody on the West Side Highway , which I know very well -- in Manhattan -- he ran over -- I think he killed about eight people , \" he said . 7 . During an interview with Rush Limbaugh , Aug. 1 , 2018 \" We have the worst laws ! How about chain migration ? One person comes in and you end up with 32 people . The person that ran down 18 people on the West Side Highway , he 's allowed to have -- and I think eight died . He has 22 members of his family in the United States because of chain migration . So we have to change this stuff , Rush , \" he said . 8 . During a campaign rally in Ohio , Aug. 4 , 2018 \" How about chain migration ? How about that ? Somebody comes in , he brings his mother , and his father , and his aunt and uncle , 15 times removed . He brings them all , \" Trump said .",

Lady Edith is n t the only one starting a romance in the final season of Downton Abbey . In Sunday s episode , Lady Mary and Henry Talbot got caught in the rain and ducked for cover and a beautifully-framed kiss . Related : â€˜ Downton Abbey Recap : Open House In fact , it was such a gorgeous shot that we wish the kiss would ve lasted longer so we could ve appreciated it more . I always feels like I ve succeeded when people say that , director Michael Engler tells Yahoo TV , because you always leave them wanting more , rather than leaving them wanting less . That said , it was a very satisfying moment , and it was a beautiful location . We made rain in the middle of London , at night , so it was pretty spectacular . Who s more beautiful than Michelle Dockery and Matthew Goode ? So to watch them kissing in the rain , in London , in a beautifully-lit moment like that was pretty wonderful . The location was Middle Temple , in the heart of London s legal quarter . I ve been going to London for years , and it s the first time I ever went in there , says Engler , a two-time Emmy nominee who was just up for a Directors Guild of America award for helming the Downton series finale . That s a pretty magical spot . It s been used on a lot of other shows because it really does look like a perfect London street . A lot of it is closed off to traffic , and it s very isolated . It s a gorgeous and completely unspoiled part of London where you really do n t have to change a thing , except for the occasional electrical outlet or sign that is modern . Engler wanted the moment to feel different than those Mary had shared with her late husband , Matthew . Matthew was such a regular guy , and he brought Mary down to a very regular place , which was what was so beautiful about it . They had such a friendship by the time they ended up together , and they were such real people , Engler says . This is a little bit more of a romantic , surprise moment , of that frisson between two people who are very attracted to each other but do n t yet know where it should go , but they take the plunge and have a kiss . I wanted it to feel a little bit more heightened in that way , and so , yeah , I think we succeeded in that .

		"paragraph": "Venmo , the popular peer-to-peer payment app favored by millennials to pay each other for rent , split a bill , or settle other expenses , is rolling out to 2 million merchants , finally allowing people to use the app to pay more than just friends and family . From the very beginning of Venmo we ve tried to make it so you can use Venmo to really buy or pay for anything , Ben Mills , Venmo s head of product , told Yahoo Finance . The service , owned by PayPal ( PYPL ) , is leveraging its parent s existing network to roll out the functionality making Venmo another option for paying online . We re going to get lots of interesting things as a result of that , said Mills , citing PayPal s purchase protection program , which will be available for Venmo purchases . For millennials or others who may favor Venmo , the rollout means many retailers will have another means to facilitate transactions more quickly and smoothly . A simple touch of the screen is simpler than inputting credit card info , and with smooth transactions from retailers like Amazon ( AMZN ) becoming the norm , merchants are constantly looking to flatten speedbumps . Retailers looking to take advantage of Venmo-fluent users will be able to do so without paying any extra , Mills said . The Venmo capabilities will be included with the standard fees merchants pay to allow customers to pay with PayPal . In addition to expanding Venmo to businesses , the company also announced an almost-instant transfer feature so users can transfer money without waiting the standard few days for the payment to clear and settle , like a check . Venmo will be charging $ 0.25 for the expedited transfer in lieu of taking a percent commission . Most p2p companies are charging a 1 % fee , said Mills . For small amounts , that might not be much , but Mills noted that millennials frequently pay each other rent . So , for $ 1,000 a flat rate is much more favorable . Venmo is shrewdly adopting this function as Zelle , the big banks overdue alternative to Venmo , has emerged , and marketing the new feature as an advantage . Mills told Yahoo Finance that this is just one step to the path to use Venmo in all situations . Though you ca n t yet pay via Venmo at the store in-person , Mills hinted that this is the app s future . Similarly , at this time , you ca n t accept a payment from an individual other than friends and family like you can on PayPal for a 3 % commission . If and when ( probably if ) these steps are completed , Venmo will look like a full-service modern digital wallet . Digital wallets like Apple Pay have n t hitherto been popular or widely used , but Venmo may be able to succeed where Apple has n t , given that millions and millions use the service .

But end it shall , with a sixth and final season kicking off January 3 , and the show s cast and producers joined reporters at PBS s Television Critics Association summer press tour Saturday to bid a fond farewell to the Crawleys . The panel kicked off with a tantalizing glimpse of what s in store for the final season . The year is 1925 : The kids are growing up , Edith is looking to spread her wings ( I d like a life ) , and even though they re engaged , Mr. Carson still refuses to call Mrs. Hughes by her first name . ( It s Elsie , for the record . ) Plus , we ll get to see the Dowager Countess and Isobel locked in another verbal sparring match , with the Countess hissing , May the best man win .

Hugh Bonneville ( Lord Grantham ) remembers the cast gathering for a team photo in the Granthams dining room , and Michelle Dockery ( Lady Mary ) and Laura Carmichael ( Lady Edith ) said they shared a moment together on the famous bench outside the castle : We had a good cry . But dry your eyes , Downton fans : Even though the show is definitely ending , executive producer Gareth Neame confirms that a follow-up movie is still a possibility . We might â€¦ it s something we ve talked about , he says , adding that there is plenty of rich territory left , dramatically speaking . But , he s quick to say , there are no firm plans at all for a movie yet . More highlights from today s Downton Abbey panel : * Penelope Wilton ( Isobel ) talked about her scenes with Emmy winner Maggie Smith , and their characters fractious and affectionate relationship . But she admits she s always at a disadvantage because of how much creator Julian Fellowes delights in writing dialogue for Smith : I think in another life , Julian would be Lady Grantham . * Neame got a bit sheepish when the subject of the show s Christmas episodes came up the Season 3 finale , which aired in the U.K. on Christmas Day , infamously ended with family heir Matthew Crawley dying in a car accident . 15 million households felt they lost a member of their family , he remembers . That was a bit awkward . * Bonneville says that a big theme of Fellowes s writing on Downton is that human nature tries to do good even villainous characters like Thomas have good intentions on some level . But he adds that the one thing he did learn from his years on Downton was : The only people who smoke cigarettes are up to no good . * Downton s eternally put-upon butler Mr. Molesley , played by Kevin Doyle , got a nice shout-out from Neame , who said that Molesley was only meant to be a minor character , but Doyle was so impressive in his initial scenes â€¦ instantly , we knew we wanted to keep him as a regular character . Alright , Molesley ! * It did n t take long for Elizabeth McGovern ( Cora ) to see the potential in Downton Abbey . She remembers that their very first table read together as a cast was magical : On that day , I knew it was going to be something special . * Sisters Mary and Edith were nasty to each other throughout the series , but Dockery and Carmichael loved that in fact , Dockery says they were disappointed when Fellowes wrote scenes where the two were actually nice to each other . Carmichael added that sisters have a special capacity to hurt each other : You know your sister more than you know anyone else â€¦ and you know where to stick the knife in . * When asked what they ll miss most about Downton , Dockery said she ll miss the clothes she got to wear as Lady Mary .

The bill includes $ 675 billion to fund the Defense Department for the full year ending on Sept. 30 , 2019 , as well as additional funds for the wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere , and $ 180 billion for the Labor , Health and Human Services and Education Departments .

		"paragraph": "OAKLAND , Calif. ( AP ) -- As much as the Oakland Raiders felt like they might have let a couple of winnable games slip away to start this season , they might have stolen one away from the Cleveland Browns to spoil Baker Mayfield 's first career start . Derek Carr led a game-tying drive in the final seconds of regulation after a replay review took away a Cleveland first down and the Raiders got their first win since Jon Gruden 's return to the sideline by beating the Browns 45-42 on Matt McCrane 's 29-yard field goal in overtime Sunday . The Raiders ( 1-3 ) blew second-half leads in each of the first three games and did n't trail any of them for a single second in the first three quarters before erasing deficits of 14 points and eight points to beat the Browns ( 1-2-1 ) and give Gruden his first win since 2008 . '' We have n't fixed anything yet , '' Gruden said . '' We have a lot of things we have to get better at . I think it is pretty obvious . We played some good football for stints . '' The Raiders rode a roller-coaster in this game , falling behind 28-14 in the third quarter before rallying for a 34-28 lead in the fourth , thanks in part to two fumbles by Mayfield . But the Browns answered with two more TDs and the Raiders appeared done when Carr threw two straight incompletions from the 9 to turn the ball over on downs with less than two minutes to play . Carlos Hyde ran three times and appeared to have a first down that would have run out the clock only to have it overturned when officials ruled his elbow touched the ground short of the marker . '' I definitely thought that we had the first down , '' Hyde said . '' But they changed the call . We got to get it right there . If we 're going to win the game , we got to get that one . '' The Raiders took over at their 47 with 1:28 to go and Carr led a game-tying drive reminiscent of 2016 , when he had seven fourth-quarter comebacks . After failing to deliver late in the first three games this season , Carr threw a 7-yard TD to Jared Cook with 30 seconds left and then added the game-tying 2-point conversion to Jordy Nelson . Carr finished with 437 yards passing and four TDs . '' The start of this year and half of this game has been some of the hardest stuff I 've ever had to deal with , because it 's frustrating things , '' Carr said . '' I feel the best - physically , mentally , all of those things that I ever have . But then I screw something up somewhere along the way . I 'll tell you this though , one thing I just said and looked to our guys and said fight . '' Here are some other takeaways : BAKER 'S DAY Mayfield threw for 295 yards and two TDs in his first career start but also had two interceptions and lost two fumbles . Those turnovers helped prevent him from becoming the third Browns QB out of 30 to win his first start with the team since the franchise returned in 1999 . '' He 's going to learn , '' coach Hue Jackson said . '' He 's got football intelligence . Today , as he goes through it , he 'll understand , and we 've talked about it a little bit , just how important those things are . You got to be team-protecting in certain situations , but you do n't want to rein him in , because I like the things he 's doing . '' BEAST MODE As the Raiders struggled to move the ball early in the game , Marshawn Lynch let his teammates know it on the sideline . He then responded with his biggest game in years , running for 130 yards in his most productive game since 2014 and inspiring his teammates by running through several tackles . '' He was saying basically that we 're putting the game on our backs , '' left tackle Kolton Miller said . '' They 're running behind us , it starts with us , he gave us really encouraging words . He said ' I 'm going to run with y' all ' and that really boosted us . '' CHUBBS RUNS Browns rookie Nick Chubb scored on runs of 63 and 41 yards , while carrying only three times all day . His 63-yard TD run was the longest by a Browns rookie since Lee Suggs had a 78-yard score on Dec. 28 , 2003 , and the third-longest run in the NFL this season . Chubb is also the first Browns rookie RB to surpass the 100-yard mark since Terrence West on Sept. 7 , 2014 . MCCRANE 'S DAY The Raiders were forced to turn to their third kicker this week when Mike Nugent was placed on IR with a hip injury after taking over for the previously injured Eddy Pineiro . They turned to rookie McCrane , who was initially signed this spring by Arizona as an undrafted free agent after setting the Kansas State record for career FGs . McCrane missed his first field goal from 47 yards and then a 50-yarder on the opening possession of OT before connecting on the game-winner . --- More AP NFL : https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP-NFL",

However , when Caceras brought the child home , she noticed something about him had \" changed , \" which caused her to worry about his condition . \" He continued to cry when we got home and would hold on to my leg and would not let me go , \" Caceras wrote in her testimony . \" When I took off his clothes , he was full of dirt and lice . It seems liked they had not bathed him the 85 days he was away from us . \" The 1,000-page lawsuit against the policy is backed by 17 states and the District of Columbia , and includes multiple heartwrenching personal testimonies like Caceras ' . Although President Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 20 to end family separations at the border , about 3,000 children still remain in federal custody , according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . The Trump administration is currently performing DNA tests on detained immigrant parents and children in a rush effort to reunite families that remain separated . A federal judge ordered the government to reunite children younger than five with their families no later than July 10 and children ages five to 17 by July 26 . Azar warned that some procedures the agency usually follows in cases like these might have to be foregone in order to meet these \" extreme \" deadlines .",

Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a Buy rating on AMD and raised the price target for the stock from $ 30 to $ 36 . A day after Stifel raised its price target for AMD by 80 percent , Lipacis echoed the argument that AMD has a major window of opportunity in the near-term thanks to missteps by rival Intel Corporation ( NASDAQ : INTC ) . ( See the analyst 's track record here . ) A new report from Fubon Research suggests Intel will not be able to fully supply the high-end PC MPU market through at least the second quarter of 2019 , and Lipacis said Intel s loss is AMD s gain . Beyond the market share opportunity , the analyst said Intel s struggles also help AMD s fundamentals as well . The best scenario for AMD is when Intel is capacity-constrained not only does AMD benefit from share gains , but also from benign pricing which leads to higher margins . \" In the longer-term , Lipacis said it s encouraging that Intel seems to be gaining a foothold in the high-end commercial desktop and server markets , a sign that its strategy to focus more on performance than price is paying off .

		"paragraph": "KANSAS CITY , Mo. ( AP ) -- For entirely different reasons , young quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs ' defense had shared most of the public 's attention through the first four weeks of the season . Mahomes had been nearly perfect . The defense had been nearly inept . Yet in their biggest test so far , against a Jacksonville team that reached the AFC title game a season ago , Kansas City responded with its most complete performance . Mahomes was still humming against the Jaguars ' top-ranked defense Sunday , while the KC defense piled up five sacks , forced five turnovers and returned one of Blake Bortles ' four interceptions for a touchdown in a 30-14 rout . '' The sky is the limit if we play all phases of the game like that , '' said Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , who had six catches for 100 yards . '' It 's a special thing when you get a whole group of guys to come together for one goal . It 's special and it 's sure as fun as hell . '' The Chiefs ( 5-0 ) certainly appear to be special right now . They 've already scored 175 points to set the franchise record for the five-game mark , while Mahomes threw for 313 yards against Jacksonville to give him a franchise-best 1,513 yards through Week 5 . Mahomes has four straight 300-yard passing games , becoming the first QB in NFL history with four in his first six career games . He will try to set the franchise record with five consecutive games when the Chiefs head to New England for a Sunday night showdown this week . '' When you play a defense like that , '' Mahomes said , '' you 're not going to score a ton . The defense stepped up , made a lot of great plays and got us into great field position . I just went out there to maximize the game plan and score when I could . '' Indeed , it sure seemed as if the Kansas City defense played with a chip on its shoulder after hearing all season how bad it has been , and hearing all week how good the Jaguars would be . The Chiefs held on fourth down inside their 5-yard line early in the second quarter . They held again on fourth down late in the game . They strip-sacked Bortles , picked him off four times and returned one for a touchdown , all despite losing a handful of players to injuries and ejections . Chris Jones , who had the pick-6 , was ejected after dropping an elbow on a Jacksonville lineman . Pass rusher Dee Ford followed him to the locker room a few minutes later after getting a second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty . Outside linebackers Justin Houston ( hamstring ) and Tanoh Kpassagnon ( ankle ) joined Eric Murray ( lower leg ) and fellow safety Armani Watts ( groin ) in getting banged-up . Yet a bunch of unheralded fill-ins responded quite well . Rookie pass rusher Breeland Speaks brought some pressure late in the game . Kpassagnon played well until he went down . And young safety Jordan Lucas , who was traded from Miami just before the start of the season , picked off his first pass after spending most of the season playing special teams . '' It 's a team . We do n't point fingers , any of that , '' Chiefs coach Andy Reid said . '' We know that every week we expect every phase - offense , defense and special teams - to pick it up if the other phase is down . We 've been able to do that so far . '' The result has been another 5-0 start , the Chiefs ' third under Reid and second in a row . But while last year 's team followed with six losses in a seven-game stretch , there are reasons to believe this year 's team will follow a different path through the middle portion of the schedule . '' We learned a lot from what happened after our 5-0 start last year , '' Chiefs wide receiver Chris Conley said . '' We know that we ca n't be excited about being 5-0 . We have to be looking forward to the next game . We have to know that it 's a long season and you have to build if you want to win . '' It helps that this year the Chiefs appear to be a more complete team . '' Last year we had a great team and we won a lot of games , '' Mahomes said . '' This year we 're just trying to learn from last year , the little drought we had , and just try to make it a procession . '' NFL seasons are long , '' he said , '' and there 's going to be ups and downs . But you kind of just grind out every single day and try to get better , and you hope you can limit the downs and maximize the ups .

I feel very sad , \" said the 30-year-old world number four who is walking with his leg in a splint after doctors confirmed he had fractured the patella bone in his right knee . \" It 's a hard blow which leaves me without any strength . It 's very difficult for me to think about recovery again . I did not expect this to happen . \" Del Potro , the US Open runner-up to Novak Djokovic this year , hobbled out of the Shanghai Masters last 16 against Borna Coric on Thursday after hurting his right knee in an awkward fall after losing his footing . He had been set to complete his year at the elite eight-man ATP World Tour Finals in London from November 11 after qualifying for the season-ending showpiece for the first time since 2013 . Del Potro has been plagued by injuries since winning his only Grand Slam title at the 2009 US Open at the age of 20 . A series of wrist injuries required four surgeries . By the end of 2015 , his ranking was at 581 , he was deeply depressed and on the verge of quitting after having to sit out 10 Grand Slam events . However , he had been rejuvenated in 2018 , reaching a career-high world number three in August . He defeated Roger Federer in this year 's Indian Wells Masters final and was a key figure when Argentina won a first Davis Cup in 2016 .

Lahren has steadily become more popular as an incendiary voice on TheBlaze , Glenn Beck s conservative media platform . Lahren who has routinely criticized San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s protest of the national anthem , called protesters of President-elect Donald Trump misfit babies , and compared Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan stepped into , as she described it , the lion s den that is The Daily Show With Trevor Noah and found herself confronted by the host over her comments . Why are you so angry ? asked Noah . I m actually not that angry , Lahren responded . It s just there are things that need to be said , Trevor , and a lot of people are afraid to say them . In an angry way , Noah disagreed . You ca n t say [ you are not ] angry and this is what you are known for . It is a strange thing to say , I m not angry , but that is the one thing â€¦ It s like Ellen saying , â€˜ I do n t like dancing . It s like , yeah , you do , Ellen , you do . You are angry about everything , it seems . Lahren has been viewed as expressing racist thoughts . She explained to Noah that she does not view herself as racist . I ve never used racial slurs to address people . I ve never looked down on people because of their skin color , Lahren explained . To me , true diversity is diversity of thought , not diversity of color . I do n t see color . I go after Hillary Clinton , and she is as white as they come . You do n t see color ? So what do you do at a traffic light ? quipped Noah in response . Both Lahren and Noah remained composed throughout their conversation , but one could feel the frustration as Noah took issue with Lahren s comparison of Black Lives Matter with the KKK . You realize Black Lives Matter can not be the new KKK , Noah said . The KKK is still around . They have not vacated their premises , and , most importantly , to say Black Lives Matter is the new KKK is to really , really minimize what the KKK did and what they stand for . That is not the same thing . Surely you understand the incendiary â€¦ feeling of your comments . You know that , surely . The conversation turned to Kaepernick , and after Lahren explained that the American flag is important to her , she took issue with people s getting upset for her expressing her views . To disrespect our flag and anthem in that way and that be your outlet to get out whatever aggression you have , whether it be passive or active aggression , I disagree with it , Lahren said . And so he has every right to do it . That is his First Amendment right , and I agree with his First Amendment right to do it . Now , so because I do n t agree with what he did , now I should shut up ? Because I m white I should shut up ?

		"paragraph": "As someone who forces myself to workout four times a week ( and only wears leggings to do so ) , I 'm somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to what shoes to wear with leggings . While I applaud those who experiment with how to style the wardrobe staple , when I 'm getting ready for a 7:00 a.m. workout , I prefer to stick to the shoes that I know will look good with every type of leggings . ( As a side note , these are n't necessarily the shoes I workout in . Most of the classes I take are done barefoot or with spin shoes or athletic sneakers . ) The three shoe styles I swear by all have a few things in common : They 're flat , comfortable , easy to get on and off , and look polished enough for post-workout errands . While some of these may seem a bit obvious , there are specific reasons why I swear by them , and specific styles that I prefer within each category . Keep reading for all of my legging-shoe insight and to shop the three styles that are perfect with leggings ( and shop leggings that would look cool with all of them ) . When the weather is warm enough , I relish in getting to wear slide sandals with my leggings . Any casual , flat style will do , but I 'm most partial to pool slides , as they 're especially comfortable and lend a sporty feel to my legging outfits . Next up , check out the controversial legging-and-Birkenstock outfit Sienna Miller wore . Loafers are probably the most versatile shoe style that I own . They look just as cool with a mini dress as they do leggings . The key is to steer clear of loafers that do n't have \" fancy \" characteristics like embellishment or metallic leather . Classic , simple loafers look best with leggings . Of course sneakers and leggings go together , but there are certain types of sneakers that I prefer to wear with leggings . If a workout requires athletic sneakers , I usually stick to Nike Free RN or Roshe Ones . When I 'm not working out , I love the convenience of slip-on sneakers , polished styles like the ones that Veja and Common Projects make , and \" It \" styles by the classic brands ( i.e. Nike , Adidas , and Reebok ) .",

		"paragraph": "Wall Street dealt with continued volatility on Monday , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average working its way lower even as other parts of the market saw gains . With earnings season hitting a crescendo this week , investors are looking closely at the specific prospects for certain corners of the market , and that 's contributing to disparities among the various major benchmarks followed most often by investors . Amid the crosscurrents , marijuana stocks took particularly hard hits , and New Age Beverages ( NASDAQ : NBEV ) , Tilray ( NASDAQ : TLRY ) , and Canopy Growth ( NYSE : CGC ) were among the worst performers on the day . Here 's why they did so poorly . All three of these stocks have given back some of their gains following the long-awaited legalization of recreational cannabis in the Canadian market last week . In the month leading up to the Oct. 17 start date for legal cannabis sales , New Age Beverages tripled in value , while Tilray had more than doubled since the end of August , and Canopy Growth had seen more modest gains of between 10 % and 20 % . Image source : Getty Images . But since then , the reality of the Canadian cannabis market appears to have put pressure on the stocks . Supply constraints have highlighted the need for further development of production facilities and retail infrastructure before consumers will be able to get all the marijuana products they want , but capacity expansion also raises fears of price declines in the long run . Threading that needle could prove problematic for the industry in general , and that explains the downbeat mood over the past few days . In addition to overall industry trends having turned negative in the short run , there are also some problems that are specific to these individual companies : Investors should expect marijuana stocks to remain volatile , with moves in both directions likely . Despite the potential of cannabis to become a much larger consumer market than it has been in the past , that 's no guarantee that those who invest in the space right now will eventually enjoy big gains from these three top marijuana stocks .

		"paragraph": "In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct scandal , there have been a dizzying number of insiders claiming that they knew nothing about the disgraced producer s predatory reputation with women in the film industry . Simone Sheffield is n t one of them . Sheffield was the talent manager for Aishwarya Rai one of India s best-known actresses , who held the Miss World title and was once dubbed the the most beautiful woman in the world . And a day after the second New York Times piece came out , with Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie also claiming that they had been sexually harassed by Weinstein , and the brutal New Yorker expos , Sheffield posted about her experience with the big bully pig in the comments section of a Variety story about Cara Delevingne coming forward as an accuser . In an industry where a lot of people feared Weinstein , Sheffield clearly did n t , as her kiss-my-you-know-what retort makes clear . Here s what she wrote , in part : I use to manage Indian actress Aishwarya Rai . While dealing with Harvey I found it comical how hard he tried to get Aishwarya alone . But he was a pig â€¦ looked and acted like a â€˜ big bully pig â€¦ . He asked me to leave the meeting numerous times and I politely declined . When we were leaving his office he cornered me and said , â€˜ What do I have to do to get her alone ? I told him to â€˜ kiss my black ass . When Ash and I returned to our hotel , I sent Harvey a steel pig trough filled with DIET COKE as a thank you gift for the meeting . Yes , we did do business and yes , he eventually threatened me . Told me I d never work in this business , blah blah blah â€¦ . what I said to him I ca n t print . But you can be sure , I never gave him the opportunity to even breathe on my client . In verifying that she was the one who posted the comment on Variety , Yahoo Lifestyle spoke with Sheffield , the president of Canyon Entertainment , who was reeling over the newer developments in the saga , including the numerous sexual assault allegations from Rose McGowan and others . If I had known rape was involved , that would change the whole story , Sheffield says . No one [ I worked with ] would have even met Harvey . Creeps are creeps . Creeps never fazed me . They are everywhere . But to sit with one ? Rape [ allegations ] changed the whole thing for me . With so many people pleading ignorance when it came to Weinstein s reputation , we were curious how she had his number early on . I think most folks in town heard stories , Sheffield tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Most folks who ever dealt with him had a story . Men were verbally abused . Women got it worse . But his money , power , excellent choice in marvelous material kept folks coming back . I ca n t be the only manager in town that either accompanied their client , or at least informed their client about his reported history . â€¦ I wish someone let these women know not to go to his hotel room . Make his fat ass go down to the lobby . Because she was clued in , she was present during any interaction Rai had with Weinstein and the meeting she referenced took place in his New York office , not a hotel room . She would have been a sitting duck , Sheffield says of Rai , who s a movie megastar in her homeland and who appeared in 2004 s Bride & Prejudice , a Bollywood-style adaptation of Jane Austen s novel Pride and Prejudice , which was distributed by Weinstein s Miramax . I was on him like white on rice . Not on my watch . While Sheffield got the last laugh with her special delivery the Diet Coke in a trough to not-so-subtly call out Weinstein for his pig - like behavior she says that , amazingly , Weinstein missed the implication . I actually got a thank-you call from his office saying he loved the Diet Coke , she says with a laugh . They did n t get it . As for what Sheffield says that Weinstein later threatened her over during another unpleasant exchange , well , it turns out it was a Marchesa dress . Aishwarya did not wear his [ then future wife Georgina Chapman s ] dress in Cannes , she recalls . After we received the gown in our room and it was not used , I called him to let him know . He went ballistic . First begging . Then threatening . Told me he ll destroy me . â€˜ I ll get you fired . â€¦ You ll never work in this business again . Their call ended with Sheffield giving it right back . I cussed him out and called him a name that stopped him in his tracks , and he hung up , Sheffield says . So what did she say that actually silenced the unsilenceable Weinstein ? The two words â€¦ [ that ] are simply too offensive for print . Worse than any locker-room chatter . Words Harvey Weinstein will never forget , trust that . I found him funny . A character from one of his own films . His threats did n t bother me at all . But , again , we all have a Harvey story . She later clarified , When I say â€˜ funny , I do n t mean funny as entertaining , but funny as in desperate to get his way . The more he tried , the more I shook my head and laughed . Sheffield says that while there are a handful of photos of Rai with Weinstein , they do n t show the full picture which was that Sheffield was always just out of the shot . I m never more than a foot away , and his arm never even went around her waist . He stood stiff as a board . She added , That went for all men who approached her unless she had a friendship with them . In subsequent photos of them together , you ll find Ash s husband , Abhishek Bachchan , with her and Harvey s poor wife and I can guarantee that no one will cross the line with Abhishek present . Sheffield who no longer manages talent ( save for her longtime client Lee Daniels , the director ) and focuses now on her career as a musical coordinator ( for Empire ) and film producer ( including Lee Daniels The Butler ) hopes that the blowing up of this scandal helps bring an end to such stories . Girls , if you see something , say something . Keep records , she says . We have to protect one another . Rai s current reps did not respond to Yahoo Lifestyle s request for comment on this story . Weinstein has apologized for the way I ve behaved with colleagues in the past , which has caused a lot of pain , but denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex . There are now more than 40 accusers . Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle : Follow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed , every day . ",

There s a lot going on for them and I know that it can be confusing . It makes me upset , especially because we sat in front of a therapist , we said what we thought was best for the kids . We felt like a lot of changes have been made lately and that this was n t the best time . When they sat down to talk after their first therapy session post-Richie drama , both parties remained frustrated , with Kourtney telling Disick to be appreciative of what you have . And you do n t think I am extremely appreciative ? he said . Not when you just do whatever you want , she responded . What s whatever I want ? Live my life the exact same way you re living it ? he fired back . It s called giving someone a heads up and having a respectful conversation giving someone the respect , she said . I make sacrifices all the time and you re not following through with the things you say you re going to do . Then you just go and do whatever you want , and I m not okay with it . Do you think you re difficult , or no ? Do you think you re overly controlling ? he asked . Do you think there s any chance you could ever be in denial about anything ? â€¦ I think you expect a lot from a lot of people . But not always can your expectations always be met , even though people are trying their hardest to please you . I will bet you one billion dollars there s not a human being that you know that wo n t go with what exactly I just said , he continued . Your own family , anybody there s not one person . So you re in denial . You want to tell your therapist this , be my guest . RELATED VIDEO : Kourtney Kardashian Says She s â€˜ Ashamed of Her â€˜ Disgusting Family : â€˜ It s Just Gross Warning him not to turn this around on me , Kourtney maintained that they need to respect the parameters they set in place . We have rules , she said . Kids need rules . It s not hard , it s not complicated . It s not , you re right , he said . But you re out of your mind if you think I m wrong . Later , she acknowledged that her longtime ex knows just how to push her buttons . Scott knows that it gets to me when he calls me controlling because he knows that s how I had to be in our relationship , she said . But me being controlling or not being controlling , it has nothing to do with what s going on here . He just tries to get everyone on his side and play the victim . Once again , Disick sat down with the family matriarch for some guidance . Months ago , when her boyfriend met the kids , she never told me upfront , he revealed . It was unexpected , it was an accident , and instead of getting angry , I knew it was part of life . Then the kids met [ Richie ] without her knowing and this and that , and then she fires off these missiles at me . I was like , â€˜ Listen , I m trying to do the best I can . I think she is trying to cope , said Jenner . When Kourtney gets upset , she often responds the same way I do , which is n t pretty . I think when it comes to one s kids and you re the mom and they live primarily with her , you have a great deal of control . I remember when my kids used to go their dad s it s the hardest thing in the world to surrender . Being a mom is the biggest job of your life , she continued . It s the hardest thing you ll ever do and it s the most important thing you ll ever do . So her response and her reaction , although it was not what you would have loved , you just have to remember that it s hard on everybody . It takes a minute , she added . It took me five years after I got divorced to get to a place where everybody was really settled and cool . I think it s like you said it s just a transition and it takes some time , Disick acknowledged . I feel like there are going to be little bumps in the road , but we re getting there . Later , the father of three admitted he could have handled the situation better . After talking to Kris , I realized that she s been there and she gets it more than anybody . My biggest mistake was not being as clear as possible , he said . I should have told Kourtney exactly what was happening , and I do realize this is something that can be hard for somebody . But by no means was I looking to make this any harder . I truly do not want Kourtney to hurt about anything , he added . After giving it some thought , he circled back to Kourtney and apologized , smoothing things over considerably . I did see his side a little bit , admitted Kourtney . Because I said , â€˜ I feel like you re doing things selfishly . And he said , â€˜ I m doing things for myself , but also because it makes me happy and I m putting that onto the kids . I do n t want to lie to them and I do n t want them to think that I m not being truthful about certain things . I m not trying to control the situation that s just me being an involved mother , she added . Ultimately , we re going to have disagreements , but I think we do a really amazing job of getting along and working together and trying to do our best to really just put the kids first .

		"paragraph": "R&B superstar Kelly Rowland is sitting with Yahoo Entertainment at a Boys & Girls Club in Long Beach , Calif. , where she is partnering with the organization and Lowe s for Renovation Across the Nation , an initiative that awards grants to renovate a club in each of the 50 states . But only a few days earlier , she witnessed firsthand a physical altercation between rappers Cardi B and Nicki Minaj at Harper s Bazaar s ICONS by Carine Roitfeld party , and that same weekend , Serena Williams was also in the news , due to a U.S. Open final argument with chair umpire Carlos Ramos ( who many thought had treated Williams unfairly ) . Since her Destiny s Child days , Rowland has been a role model for young people , particularly young girls . So , in light of both these events , she is in an especially thoughtful mood this afternoon . I love both these ladies [ Cardi and Nicki ] , and I admire and respect what they ve done in music thus far . And as women we ve come such a long way , and you have to really ask , â€˜ What are we fighting for ? That was just really my take on it , Rowland , who attended the Harper s Bazaar NYFW soiree and was actually separately photographed with both Nicki and Cardi that night , says of the rappers infamous skirmish . Rowland seems much more supportive the fight that her friend Williams is now leading , in light of the tennis star s allegedly sexist treatment by Ramos since she feels that instead of women battling each other , they should join forces to fight for more important causes . I ve just finished hearing Serena talk about women s equality , how things are just so different in sports , and how , when you show passion , for a woman , it s turned into something else . I even heard [ famously cantankerous male tennis player John ] McEnroe speak on it he said , â€˜ I ve said way worse things . And I m just like , â€˜ OK , there ca n t be a double standard , says Rowland . And it continues to be , and I was so proud of Serena that she spoke out about it , that she said that she s going to be a part of changing that . I pray that other women will get on board and be a part of that with her . I know I am . Rowland does n t get into specifics , but she confesses that as a strong woman , she has experienced that double standard in her own career . I think that if you stick up for yourself , you re either called names , or you should stay in a â€˜ woman s place , she muses , once again drumming home the message of female solidarity . What does that mean ? There s several hats that women wear , and we wear them oh so well . Because in years , we ve seen women go from being CEOs of Fortune 500 companies , entrepreneurs . We re running this . We re shaping the world , and we have to sow into each other . And if we have a disagreement about anything , I know that it s space for us to talk about it . So I think that we re in a different time right now , but we have to have each other s backs , and be secure with what we bring to the table . And I think that when we do that , and we re able to acknowledge others , it s a more peaceful place . On that note , Rowland is proud that Destiny s Child songs like Independent Women , Pt. 1 and Survivor have become worldwide feminist anthems . When you think about what we were saying at that time , we were so young , marvels Rowland , who started performing with the group when she was in her tweens . But I m so happy that we took a stance with records like that . Because even when you travel the world , and you saw how different parts of the world were , and you saw women singing that song with a different type of conviction , and you wonder what everyone s story behind it is . So it s just a huge amount of respect that I have for independent women and survivors . I m so happy that we stood for something : lyrics quoted on different signs , being held at marches , women s marches . â€¦ [ I m ] really , really proud , and grateful to be part of a historical record . Rowland is a longtime Boys & Girls Club supporter and an honorary alum . Of her time spent working and speaking with children at Boys & Girls Clubs throughout America , she says she often experiences a moment of seeing myself in one of the young ladies , and she always tries to get her message across . I remember we did an event in Vegas , and there was a young lady who just kept her head down . And I could n t figure out why , and she lifted her head up , and she was just going through growing up as a young lady , and she had a little breakout , Rowland recalls . She was like , â€˜ They keep picking on me . I said , â€˜ Look , people will call you what you answer to . You always remember who you are as a young woman . And do n t let name-calling get to you , because you eventually learn to have people respect you . And they ll put some respect on your name . And just , you do n t have to answer to that . That s ridiculous , you do n t ever have to answer to that . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : Follow Lyndsey on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google + , Amazon , Tumblr , Spotify",

		"paragraph": "After spending a couple of years signaling an impending shift in focus away from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies , Circle Financial seems to be executing a 180-degree shift in strategy , boosting its crypto-related offerings in a series of moves that some say are positioning it as a competitor to Coinbase . Founded in 2013 , its flagship offering Circle Pay was initially positioned as a bitcoin-only peer-to-peer payments solution , comparable in operation to non-crypto platforms like Venmo and Squarecash . With expansion however came an apparent shift in direction , culminating in co-founder Jeremy Allaire s famous 2016 declaration that Bitcoin would be obsolete within a decade in the manner of NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator . In line with this thinking , Circle Pay discontinued support for on-platform Bitcoin purchases in 2016 , in favour of next-gen blockchain tech while still making use of the Bitcoin blockchain for back-end functions . The idea then was that Bitcoin itself was a short-lived bubble , but blockchain technology would survive it and become the real winner from the cryptocurrency boom . In recent months however , Circle has silently ramped up its crypto investment service offerings , acquiring a Bitcoin exchange ( Poloniex ) and rolling out services that support retail crypto trading ( Circle Invest ) and institutional crypto trading ( Circle Trade ) . Circle Invest is of particular attention because it enables users to trade seven supported cryptocurrencies on the platform . A new feature on Circle Invest called â€˜ Buy The Market â€˜ even permits equal spread investment across all seven cryptos with as little as $ 1 . The pointed change in strategy has not gone unnoticed , with several analysts pointing out that Circle Invest and Circle s wider strategy is now looking very similar to that of Coinbase in terms of operation and target market . In their eyes , this is evidence that Circle may in fact be morphing into a traditional full-service crypto investment company . Co-founder Sean Neville does not , however , agree with this notion . He sees Circle Invest as merely a logical result of Circle s evolution which Bitcoin has always been central to , instead of a fundamental change in direction . In his words : Jeremy Allaire also avoids the comparisons with Coinbase , describing Circle as a competitor primarily to conventional financial service firms like TransferWise , Venmo and Square Cash .

		"paragraph": " We have a going rate , in the modern NBA , and that going rate is two second round picks . Teams have been just about completely unavailable to pry first round picks Chicago s nebulous and conditional take for Luol Deng included during this year s trade deadline season . The Philadelphia 76ers and Cleveland Cavaliers proved as much on Thursday morning , when the Sixers sent serviceable big man Spencer Hawes to the nobody-knows-what s - going-on-up-there Cavs . Philly will receive two second round picks , the disappointing Earl Clark , and the still-raw Henry Sims . Cleveland will receive a big man that can walk and chew gum at the same time . The move is n t a cap-clearer for Philadelphia , Hawes is set to become a free agent this summer and was almost certainly going to leave the rebuilding 76ers , but it does n t knock $ 1.5 million off the team s books this season . That would seem to be a potential trade helper for a squad looking to add assets to start over following the middling Doug Collins years , but newish general manager Sam Hinkie s team has been below the salary cap all season , and has n t been rumored to want to add hefty contracts and the stars that usually come with them . In fact , this move takes Philadelphia even farther away from the league s minimum salary cap , although the penalty for not reaching that ( the difference in money is divvied up between the remaining players ) is laughable and hardly prohibitive . No , for Philadelphia , this is all about a pair of 2014 second round picks to goof around with . Clark s contract is n t guaranteed for next year , and Sims is a free agent . They moved a center they did n t need for a minimal return , as is custom in the modern era . Luol Deng may still be on the market for Cleveland , but for now Hawes should help with the team s desperate push to make it to the playoffs for the first time since LeBron James left in 2010 . Hawes production and attitude may have taken a hit as Philly s tortuous 2013-14 moved along , but he still averaged 13 points , 8.5 boards , and 3.3 assists in 31 minutes a contest , starting all 53 of his games . Those stats may be inflated a bit by Philadelphia s league-fastest pace , but his shot chart is nothing to sniff at : The move also provides further buffering for the Cavaliers should they decide to deal Deng , who has made no bones about exploring the free agent market this summer , or possibly even move Anderson Varejao . Varejao was a favorite of former Cleveland GM Chris Grant , who kept hold of him despite his trade value and prime career presence on a rebuilding team , but with new GM David Griffin running things , Anderson possibly turns into a terrific asset a very good player whose contract is only guaranteed for $ 4 million next season . For now , though , Hawes ( and , hopefully , a re-invigorated attitude ) will help space the floor ( he s hit nearly 40 percent of his three-pointers this season ) and make defenders pay for sending extra attention Kyrie Irving s way . And , as a 2014 free agent , he s hardly a long-term risk . If Deng leaves and Varejao s contract is n t picked up , the Cavs could have ungodly amounts of cap space this summer . The same goes for Philadelphia , especially if they manage to dump Evan Turner ( a restricted free agent with a massive qualifying offer and cap hold this summer ) and Thaddeus Young ( due over $ 19 million next year and in 2015-16 ) to other teams before the end of Thursday s trade deadline . Both Turner and Young are pretty solid players . They could possibly even fetch a second round pick , or two . - - - - - - - Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "From ELLE Anyone who has even been to a close friend s wedding will know all too well the tribulations of choosing a gift suitable for ' the couple who has everything ' . A burnt orange Creuset pot ? They have two . Matching Away luggage ? They bought some last year . Money towards the honeymoon ? It s already paid for . But , spare a moment for guests of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle s royal wedding as it s just been revealed that the newlyweds have been forced to return some of their wedding gifts . The Express reports Kensington Palace has received gift boxes and parcels for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from companies and celebrities with a combined estimated value of 7 million , which must be returned . Official guidelines that prevent royals from being exploited for commercial purposes state : â€˜ Gifts offered by commercial enterprises in the UK should normally be declined , unless they are offered as a souvenir of an official visit to the enterprises ' premises , to mark a Royal marriage or other special personal occasion . When gifts are accepted , the consent of the Member of The Royal Family should be contingent upon the enterprise undertaking not to exploit the gift for commercial purposes . ' Gifts offered by private individuals living in the UK not personally known to the Member of The Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety or motives of the donor or the gift itself . ' It makes sense then that the newlyweds specifically requested well-wishers to donate to a list of chosen charities close to their hearts , rather than sending presents , before their nuptials . On the day of their wedding , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement on May 19 - the day of the wedding - the country will donate 29,000 ( $ 50,000 ) to a youth charity called Jumpstart dedicated to making play and sports more accessible to children from disadvantaged backgrounds . Meanwhile , New Zealand s Prime Minister Jacinda Arden told reporters that on behalf of the country , New Zealand was making a 2,500 ( $ 5,000 NZ ) donation to a charity the supports children and families of prisoners called Pillars . However , other global leaders took a more creative interpretation of the wish for donations . French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly gave the Royal couple a bespoke piece from ST Dupont s 007 collection , while the Taronga Zoo in New South Wales , Australia revealed they would name two koalas after the couple and donate 2,800 to â€˜ preserving koala habitats . Kensington Palace has not revealed how much money has been raised in donations . You Might Also Like",

		"paragraph": "Kim Kardashian West dished on all things KKW Beauty , the upcoming season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians and Kanye West 's major influence on her style at the BoF West Summit at Westfield Century City on Monday . The social media star was joined by her mom and manager extraordinaire , Kris Jenner , onstage as two of the keynote speakers at the industry event , where the future of fashion and beauty businesses was the topic of conversation . Kim was head-to-toe chic in a white Jacquemus shirt-and-skirt combo with long wavy tresses and glowing skin , while Kris made a statement in a graphic Akris pantsuit . The two sat down with BoF 's editor-in-chief , Imran Amed , to discuss Kim 's rise to the top as a savvy entrepreneur as well as her influence on the beauty industry and the creative freedom of running your own company on social media . \" I do n't really look at the traditional forms of what I 'm seeing in the magazines , \" Kim , 37 , said . \" I 'm just kind of doing what I want to do and I 've always been really confident in the image that I want to put out there . When you have your own business , you can 100 percent control it . You can choose the photographer and the images and the look and every last detail you want to do . I 've always done what has felt right and feels good and have not really worried about what I think the consumer wants , but instead guide them with what I want . I think if you have your own business and it 's run by social media , you can have the power to do that . \" Kim revealed one of her early beauty inspirations and how she was thrilled to find a woman who looked like her to emulate -- a role she embodies now for many women . \" When Salma Hayek came on the scene , I was so excited there was someone that I felt like , even though we are not the same nationality , I looked similar to and that was someone I would go to for beauty advice . I remember that time it was prom and I wanted to figure out what hairstyle I wanted , so I would look at her red carpet looks . \" As the mastermind behind the Kardashian-Jenner empire , Kris offered her advice on being proactive and creating a successful business . \" If someone says no , you re talking to the wrong person . So just never give up and if you have an idea and you feel passionate about doing that as a business , really make a commitment . Let s figure out how to do it and let s roll up our sleeves and find somebody that shares the same joy . It really gives me incredible joy to be able to find these different things the girls like to do and go out there and figure out a way to do it . \" Kim is undoubtedly a fashion darling , always decked out in the best designer wares , but it was n't easy for the mom of three to be taken seriously by the industry at first . But luckily , her husband stepped in and helped her find her way . \" I always thought I had really good style until I met my husband and he told me that I had the worst style , \" Kim admitted . \" He was really nice about it and cleaned out my whole closet . I probably had 250 pairs of shoes and when we were done cleaning it out , I had two pairs left and I cried . We went to the Laker game and my closet was filled back up with all new stuff . There were racks of clothes of designers I have never heard of before like Lanvin and Givenchy . I did n t know that then . I kept everything because it was really sentimental to me . He had all these fashion books and one by Carine Roitfeld and said , ' One day Carine will style you , ' and I was like , ' Yeah right , I do n t know who this is . ' Now , she s one of my good friends . I wanted to learn . I was n t offended when he said that . When he did that he wanted to teach me . \" Kim later made her way to Paris and began to connect with designers like Riccardo Tisci ( formally of Givenchy and currently at Burberry ) and Olivier Rousteing of Balmain , who now see her as their muse . \" I went to Paris and started meeting with these people and no one would dress me at the beginning . We would finally get a little in and Riccardo would dress me . He was the first person to really take a chance on me and he would teach me so much about the fits and cuts and how I should wear things . And then I became really close with Olivier . None of the samples would fit me , so they started to design things that were more curvy and that would fit someone who had more of my body type . \" Kim and Kris also spilled some secrets on what to expect from the upcoming season 15 of KUWTK , revealing there was a \" major blowout \" that is \" strung out over the first three episodes . \" Do they think the show will ever stop ? \" We 're going to be here forever ! \" Kris half-joked . \" North gets married ! I used to say that about Kylie when she was 10 . \" \" Season 17 , Kylie has a baby ! \" Kim added . \" And then we all looked at each other , like , that just happened . \" See how Kim and Kylie had a matching sister moment in Yeezy in the video below .

		"paragraph": "Success and stress do n't need to go hand in hand , as proven by Sundar Pichai 's calm , simple morning routine . Google 's chief executive oversees more than 85,000 employees across five continents , all while juggling company demands and creating long-term strategies for business growth . Though many top execs wake before dawn to tackle workouts and a flurry of emails , Pichai prefers a low-key start . It 's a habit worth making : studies find that people who start their mornings in a calm mood usually stay that way throughout the day , according to a Wharton Business School study . A relaxing morning might be especially important for millennials . People in this group feel the most stress of any generation and are the most likely to see themselves as \" work martyrs . \" Intense pressure to succeed can make every part of the day more challenging . According to a Family Work Institute study , overworked people are more likely to make mistakes on the job or feel anger and resentment toward their colleagues . They 're also less likely to be able to cope with everyday life events . A pressure to succeed in all aspects of life might even make home more stressful than the office . Here are five ways Google 's Sundar Pichai works calmer , not harder . While some business leaders like Kevin O'Leary and Tim Cook wake at 4:30 a.m. or earlier , Pichai has a different take . \" I 'm not a morning person , \" Pichai admits in an interview with Recode . This Google exec still gets a jump on the day , waking around 6:30 to 7 a.m every morning . If you 're not yet in the habit of waking early , some research might change your mind . In one study , a biologist found that early risers are better positioned for business success because they are more proactive and their routines sync with common corporate schedules . In another study , scientists found that people who get out of bed by 7 a.m. , on average , do better in the workplace and have a lower chance of being depressed , stressed and overweight . Reading does for the brain what exercise does for the body it makes you stronger . So if your modus operandi is to scroll through social media upon waking , try swapping that out for a book or newspaper . Research indicates that the act of reading can heighten overall brain function , enhance memory and improve mental flexibility . Reading can also reduce stress levels . As for Pichai , he says that he reads a \" physical paper every single morning . \" \" I 'm vegetarian so I need to get my protein , \" says Pichai . \" I always have an omelet in the morning with toast . \" As the first meal of the day , a high-quality breakfast plays a key role in supplying energy and nutrients that are critical for workday productivity . On the other hand , eating a poor breakfast or skipping it altogether can lead to a decline in attention , memory and overall cognitive function and work performance . Tapping his Indian roots , Pichai reveals that he enjoys a steaming mug of tea with his breakfast . While he does n't specify the type , tea is purported to have a number of health benefits and can be a great alternative for coffee-drinkers . According to MayoClinic , black tea has a fraction of the caffeine found in coffee , meaning you can still get the boost in mental clarity with fewer stress-inducing jitters . Pichai says he does n't consider the work Google does as a \" zero-sum game \" and thinks for the longer term . Focusing on the big picture can help all workers gain perspective , improving how they prioritize and how they react throughout the day . Like this story ? Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube !

Jones was ejected from the Game 1 of the Cleveland Cavaliers second-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors on Monday night after receiving two technical fouls for trash talking after a dunk in garbage time . The Cavs were up 116-102 with 18 seconds left , the win was sealed , and there was really no reason for Jones to run his mouth . But he did . The comments are going to cost him . ESPN s Brian Windhorst reported that he will have to pay $ 6,000 in fines for the two techs and the ejection . Jones made just $ 9,000 this year from the Cavaliers after they signed him for the veteran s minimum just before the end of the regular season . Reminder : James paid Jones fine last year when he was suspended for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals for hitting then-Raptors center Bismack Biyombo in the groin . The price was n t so steep then , though . James only had to shell out about $ 80 to cover that fine . After the Game 1 win , James said he d once again come in to save the day , and Jones wallet , but not without a little warning : I told him tonight , â€˜ Now listen , Dahntay . Enough is enough , ' James told reporters after the game , laughing . â€˜ You gon na stop getting kicked out against Toronto all the time , all right ? So I can stop paying your damn fines .

Why would you want to be with somebody that would hold a baby from you and not tell you where it is ? That s unsafe . God forbid something happened to her , you would n t know where the baby was . â€¦ You ca n t be with someone like that . You re better than that . In an interview , Pauly admits that he thinks Jen and Ronnie are toxic together . They need to separate and get some parenting rights , he says . While Ronnie s gone , Jen comes knocking with a friend in tow . She wants to know where Ronnie is and does n t believe the cast when they insist that they do n t know . She alleges that last night , he went on a f ing rampage , texting me every name in the book in over 300 messages . And she insists that someone has to know where Ronnie really is . Obviously someone s with him , a producer or â€¦ she says , looking around the room . So , a producer interrupts her , reminding her that they d told her he d be back at a specific time later and suggesting that she leaves and comes back . This seemingly blows up her ruse : She knew he was n t home when she traveled to the hotel . You guys are f ed up ! You guys are f ing liars ! she cries out as she leaves . That girl came to this room with an agenda , to tell her side of the story and paint this picture that Ronnie s this animal , Pauly says . Jen is gangster . She s trying to play everybody . She s not going to play me . Later , Ronnie returns , saying he feels better and got a lot of good information from the lawyer . The group goes out for dinner at an Italian restaurant as he stays behind , bracing himself for Jen . She explodes the moment she walks into the suite . Ron ! You re texting me I m a f ing wh , I m a liar , I m a f ing cheater ? she yells . Calm down , he asks . No . I m not gon na calm down . I do n t want to hear your whole f ing bull story . â€¦ You re calling me a f ing wh ? Motherf er ? Then , he loses it , too . You re driving me crazy ! he screams . All you do is use that kid as a f ing pawn ! You re a f ing psychopath . You re a f ing loser . You re a piece of s , she says and spits in his face .

Benjamin Choucroun , 13 , was at the White House to cover the president s fitness event as a TIME for Kids reporter on the South Lawn . He tells PEOPLE curiosity drew him into the West Wing press briefing room when he and his dad walked by just before Sanders briefing started . After fielding nearly 20 minutes of sometimes combative questions about the president s imperiled summit with North Korea , Trump s tweet on Roseanne Barr , and more Sanders called on the newcomer in the room . And the young colleague in the back ? Sanders said . The boy , who goes by Benje , explained to Sanders that his school had recently undergone a lockdown drill . One thing that affects mine and other students mental health is the worry about the fact that we or our friends could get shot at school , he said . Specifically , can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies ? Sanders , who has three children , choked back tears as she responded with , I think that as a kid , and certainly as a parent , there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe . So I m sorry that you feel that way . This administration takes it seriously , she continued . And the School Safety Commission that the President convened is meeting this week , again , an official meeting to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off . Choucroun spoke to PEOPLE after the briefing and said he was initially nervous about asking the question because I knew that these press conferences were a big deal and Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a big deal . RELATED VIDEO : Comedian Michelle Wolf Roasted Sarah Sanders at the White House Correspondents Dinner The teenager said he was surprised that she got emotional , but that he would n t have changed it because it made me feel like I was drawing attention to the issue . I m glad I did it because school shootings , as we saw in Santa Fe , are something that needs to be stopped , Choucroun said . And I m happy that I raised awareness to the issue . His question comes after a gunman killed 10 people at Santa Fe High School in Texas earlier this month . The attack was preceded by another mass shooting in Parkland , Florida , which took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . A total of 17 people were killed .",

		"paragraph": "Warning : Storyline and character spoilers ahead for \" The Comic Book Store Regeneration \" episode of The Big Bang Theory . Never again will we hear the shrill voice of Debbie Wolowitz bellow \" Hooow-ARD ! \" at the top of her lungs , for the funny but never fully seen onscreen lady who birthed the tight pants-wearing Howard Wolowitz is gone . In an episode that dealt with the real-life death of hilarious character actress Carol Ann Susi , Mrs. Wolowitz also passed away , failing to wake up from a nap while visiting her sister in Florida . The Big Bang Theory showrunner Steven Molaro talks to Yahoo TV about dealing with the heartbreaking loss of the cast 's beloved co-star and honoring her and her character . He also discusses how Mrs. W 's death will affect Howard and his friends , the special guest star who provided some welcome moments of levity in the episode , and what 's ahead for Shamy and roomies Sheldon and Leonard . Congratulations , Steve . Tone is so critical when dealing with a storyline like this one on a sitcom , and this felt like a fine tribute to Mrs. Wolowitz.Thank you . Carol Ann Susi was a lovely lady and a member of our family that we cared about very much . So it was important to us to come up with a way of honoring her that reflected how much we care about her . Viewers know Susi from her work on Seinfeld , The King of Queens , and most of all The Big Bang Theory , but what was she like on the set?She was just a truly funny , very sweet , very interesting lady . She reminded me of your favorite crazy aunt , who you loved getting to visit with . Is it true that she did n't drive , that she took a bus everywhere in Los Angeles , even to auditions ? [ Laughs . ] Yes , yes . She was very New York . She did n't have a car there , and she just stuck with it here . Was there any consideration of not writing her death into the show ? Having the character move away?We talked about all the possibilities . It was public information that Carol Ann had passed away , so having Mrs. Wolowitz move away felt , I think , potentially like a cheat . And the thought of having another actress do the voice just did n't seem like an option for us . I do n't think we could have brought ourselves to actually do it . That left dealing with the reality of it . We tried to find a way to do that which let the show still remain a comedy , but deal with this very difficult moment in these characters ' especially Wolowitz 's lives . How did you begin tackling it?I do n't know . I had never been involved in writing an episode like this before . There 's a lot of other things going on in this episode that have nothing to do with [ her death ] , and that , I think , helped a lot . When the moment comes , we just tried to handle it as honestly as we could , certainly not try to force jokes in where they did n't feel like they would belong . I think we managed to do it . And actually , now that I think about it , the morning that Carol Ann passed away , we were obviously stunned and shaken up . We were in production that week , and everybody gathered on the stage . Chuck [ Lorre ] had delivered the news to everyone , and it just naturally turned into a memorial to her . Everyone on the stage cried and shared their wonderful memories and stories of Carol Ann . And even in the tension and pain of that moment , people were able to still laugh about how wonderful she was . This was 15 minutes after hearing the news . I think it was in the spirit of that â€¦ at the end of the episode , I guess we were subconsciously trying to capture that mood of sad but sweet and celebratory . Look back some of our favorite Mrs. Wolowitz moments : The scene where they 're all toasting her is lovely . Howard 's initial reaction was very interesting . It feels like there is a whole lot more going on underneath it . I think he was stunned . I take it as just stunned . [ His mom ] was in Florida at the time , so there was n't a hospital he could rush to . There was nothing he could do except sit down and try to wrap his head around what just took place . It was a nice , unselfish moment by Sheldon , too , and a very Sheldon-appropriate way of letting Howard know his friends are there for him.Yeah , that 's a really sweet moment . We really took our time writing that and wanted to get that scene as good as we could . Howard 's relationship with his mother also was very complicated , even more so recently with the whole Stuart situation . He mentioned earlier in the episode that , now that Stuart is getting back on his feet with the reopening of his comic book store , he hoped his relationship with his mom could get back to normal . So he 's dealing with a lot of feelings about his mom when she dies.He is . And it seemed like everyone [ else ] in the episode is fighting with each other , and then this bomb drops . It levels the playing field out . Everything else becomes trivial . What does Mrs. Wolowitz 's death mean for poor Stuart , who had made this little family for himself with her ? I think it is a sad time for everybody . And they 're adjusting to life after her death . We 'll feel our way through that , but for now , nobody is kicking him out of her house . Right now â€¦ all the things you have to deal with after someone passes away are being dealt with . And there does n't really seem to be a need to kick him out . So , that 's where we are right now . Did you have specific plans in mind for Stuart and Mrs. Wolowitz ? There was a bit of a will-they-won ' t-they element in their relationship.I think we had intentionally wanted to keep it vague . Is it just friendly ? Is it more mother and son ? Is it really romantic ? To me , the fun was never quite knowing exactly what was going on . Obviously this death will always affect Howard and Bernadette . But in the more immediate sense , we know Howard and Bernadette have gone to Florida . Will they continue to deal with this in next week 's episode?Yeah . We will continue to deal with it throughout the rest of the season , on and off . We 've heard little things about Howard 's dad throughout the series . Is that something that might pop up again now , in a bigger way ? Might he go look for his MIA dad after losing his mom?Yeah , I think that is a very legitimate question you 're asking . We 've not delved into that yet . I think his dad is always a potential storyline at some point , though . Nothing that we 're poking at just yet . As you said , there 's a lot happening in this episode , with the comic book store reopening and looking cool , Sheldon and Amy secretly testing the intelligence of Leonard and Penny , and Raj and Leonard having a really fun run-in with guest star Nathan Fillion . How did that come about ? I had run into him at Comic-Con last year , and I 'm a fan of his . And one of the other writers , Steve Holland , was with me , and we just started talking to him and telling him we were from Big Bang and big fans of his . And he 's a fan of the show and was very supportive . We just started talking about him being on the show someday , and he was certainly open to it . So when this storyline popped up , it seemed like a great little way to use him . And it just all worked out . He was just great , and we had a lot of fun with him . That storyline , of pretending he is n't who he is to get a little alone time in public , is something you can imagine has really happened to guys like him and another TBBT guest star , Wil Wheaton . Was there any inspiration for that story?I think we just liked the idea . When I first talked to Nathan about it , I do n't think we quite knew the ending . At that point in time , he either was Nathan Fillion and just wanted to eat his lunch and not be bothered or he was a guy who just happened to look like Nathan Fillion . We thought those were both pretty fun ways to go , but we ultimately went with what seemed like the most satisfying and interesting ending . I thought it played very organically and real . I think he is known for being pretty great with his fans , so he managed to get away with it and just say , \" Yeah , it 's me , I was just trying to have my lunch , but let 's take a picture . \" I would love to have him back on again someday . Photos : What a Day in the Life of Mayim Bialik Looks Like What can you say about the rest of the season?The two things that are coming to mind are that Wolowitz and Bernadette will continue to deal with the fallout of his mother passing away . And I do think , overall , if there is any silver lining in all of this as far as the character goes , it 's an opportunity for Howard to continue to grow as a person . And , in the episode with Stephen Hawking , Leonard and Sheldon wrote that paper together , based on Leonard 's idea . And now they are sort of handcuffed to each other because they 've done that . That storyline continues to pop up as we move through to the end of the season . And Shamy ? Sheldon and Amy , even if it 's the tiniest thing , they are getting closer every episode.They are . They are absolutely . And they will continue to do so throughout this season . The Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on CBS .",

		"paragraph": "Reboots are a tricky business after all , this is n t the first time they ve tried to bring back MacGyver but this time , they almost made it look easy . Season 1 is ending as one of CBS s more watched shows and we talked with Lucas Till , as they put the finishing touches on the season finale , about what he s learned , what his hopes are for next season , and what it s like to sink in quicksand . It was a whirlwind experience , says Till when asked about the finale . There s gon na be a little more interaction with Murdoc again I wo n t spoil what it is but , a little bit . And , there s an old character coming back not an old character coming back from our show , but from the original called Dr. Zito , who s another one of MacGyver s nemesises , nemeses , nemesi ? Whatever the plural of those is . One of those guys . Zito is played by Mark Sheppard ( Supernatural ) who , Till points out , is the real life son of the original Dr. Zito , W. Morgan Sheppard . See Dr. Zito from the original MacGyver : Things are a bit easier now for Till than they were almost a year ago when they first started filming . It s a lot more fun now , he tells us . In the beginning , it was like threading a needle . You got ta be a hero but you got ta be humble , but you got ta have a little bit of snark or cockiness in there because you are a secret agent and you know what you re capable of . But you got ta be modest about it . You got ta be a nice guy ! He feels like there s a stiffness to the first half of the season because of all the notes he was getting , but eventually he figured out how to get more of his personality into the character . Now , you just show up and play yourself , so it s easy , Till jokes . Of course , it s never really easy . Not even after a season of figuring out the show s flow , learning tricks about how to shoot . He s done it enough now that he can offer advice to directors . I have to guide people how to do the MacGyver stuff now . It s its own thing . It s its own character . But he laughs now at the thought of how truly intense those early days were . Till and co-star George Eads would work through the night , not just rehearsing , but finding their characters and establishing the rhythms that make the show unique , all while settling into a new town ( MacGyver shoots in Atlanta ) . I do n t think either of us are ready for [ the pace of ] the beginning of the show , but we definitely kicked into high gear for the end . Sometimes , all the experience in the world ca n t help you and you just have to tough it out . The Colton episode [ episode 16 , Hook ] , we start off in quicksand . That was weird . It was a cauldron of goo , Till recalls , We had to move it to another day because the goo was 215 degrees in some parts and 60 degrees in other parts . It had to be stirred like a witches cauldron . We got into it in wetsuits . And the compression â€¦ let s just say your extremities can get a little bunched up . The pressure was insane ! They could n t move until all the shots were done , so sweat began burning his eyes . I started swatting at it , trying to get away . They actually inserted a fly , digitally , to explain his odd behavior . Finally , they finished and he went back to his trailer to shower , only to find that a leak had sprung in the water heater , so the refreshing shower smelled like sulfur . Till does n t mind , though . That pain , that weirdness , is where the fun and the better moments come from . This exclusive sneak peek clip features MacGyver doing some cutting-edge field medicine on Bozer ( Justin Hires ) , whose role has greatly expanded since the first episode . He was having a great time getting paid the same amount , but only working one day . Now , he s working a lot more in episodes . He s doing MacGyver moments , they ve got him doing stunts , they ve got him doing all kinds of stuff ! Till laughs and says he warned Hires : Do n t do too good of a job you wo n t be rewarded for it ! Till definitely has hopes for next season although , since he is n t a writer , he does n t have much say in it . More women would be good . The guy had a new girl every episode and it was definitely a talking point when my reps were talking to me about why I should do this . Till laments , Man ! I do n t have any time to go kiss girls on the weekend I need them to come to work ! In fact , the writers do have a just awesome plan for him , but it s too early to spill the beans on anything just yet . I think the show is just going to continue to be really , really fun . So , I m excited ! The first season finale of MacGyver airs Friday , April 14 at 8 p.m. on CBS .

		"paragraph": "HELENA , Mont. ( AP ) U.S. Sen. Jon Tester gave President Donald Trump a tongue-in-cheek welcome to Montana on Thursday by taking out a full-page ad in more than a dozen newspapers thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored . Trump was scheduled to hold a rally in the city of Great Falls to campaign for Tester 's Republican challenger , State Auditor Matt Rosendale . The president has made the Montana Senate race a priority after he blamed Tester for derailing the nomination of his Veterans Affairs nominee , White House physician Ronny Jackson . Tester 's ad , which ran in the Great Falls Tribune and in newspapers across rural northern and eastern Montana , sought to undermine the president 's efforts to boost Rosendale by pointing out that he and the president agree on several issues . \" Welcome to Montana , and thank you President Trump for supporting Jon 's legislation to help veterans and first responders , hold the VA accountable , and get rid of waste , fraud and abuse in the federal government , \" the ad read . The Tester campaign also planned a statewide radio ad campaign to run through the weekend touting his bills that Trump has signed . The National Republican Senatorial Committee in a statement called Tester 's ads a \" pitiful \" effort to paint himself as a Trump ally before the rally . Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election in states that Trump won in the 2016 election . Trump singled out Tester in April , saying the farmer from Big Sandy \" will have a big price to pay \" for releasing allegations against VA nominee Jackson that included drunkenness , overprescribing medication and fostering a hostile work environment . Jackson denied the claims but withdrew his nomination . Montana is the latest stop on Trump 's midterm campaign tour , designed to boost Republicans as well as tout his first 18 months in office . He recently made a similar trip to North Dakota and is expected to keep traveling throughout the summer . In Great Falls , Trump planned to promote his record on the economy and national security , said a person familiar with the president 's plans , adding that Trump would stress his recent moves on immigration and foreign policy as well as the low unemployment rate . The person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity . The president also was expected to paint Tester as an \" obstructionist \" and embrace Rosendale as a better fit for the state that he won by 20 points . The visit comes less than two weeks after his eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , campaigned for Rosendale in the city of Billings . Rosendale , who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation , said Trump has focused on the race because of Tester 's \" liberal obstruction . \" Montana , a purple state that elects both Republicans and Democrats to statewide offices , strongly supported Trump in the 2016 election , leading both candidates to compete for Trump supporters . Rosendale said he 'll back Trump 's agenda , while Tester said he 'll support the president when it 's in the state 's interests and oppose him when it 's not . Tester planned to spend Thursday listening to farmers ' and business owners ' concerns about Trump 's import tariffs and was expected to be driving back to his farm when the president spoke , spokeswoman Marnee Banks said . Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report . This story has been corrected to show that Jackson was not Trump 's first Veterans Affairs nominee .",

Citizens Bank Park has averaged 27,790 per game this season , which represents only a slight increase over the past three seasons . Yet , that figure has been growing steadily since June 25 . Over their first 37 games , the Phillies were averaging just 24,714 . In the last 19 , it 's jumped to 33,782 a difference of over 9,000 . And if people are talking about the Phillies on the radio and social media , even if only to complain nobody is talking about the team , well , then people are still talking about the team , are n't they ? It 's reasonable to project attendance will likely continue improving as long as the Phillies are in contention . This town loves a winner . The bandwagon is coming . As for why it 's taken a little longer for some folks to get on board , that part is easy . The Phillies do n't have a problem with being likable or relatable , as some have said . Quite simply , this team came from nowhere . Some people have a short memory or never went away . Others tuned out while the Phillies were stumbling to 63 , 71 and 66 wins over the past three seasons , with two last-place finishes and the worst record in baseball in 2015 . While there was hope the organization was on the rise , expectations were n't very high in April . The Phillies hired a first-time manager . Much of their young core was still at Lehigh Valley a year ago . Even after some savvy free-agent additions and deadline dealings , there are few stars on the roster , particularly on offense . This squad has drawn comparisons to the 2007 club , which saw the franchise return to the playoffs after a 13-year drought . There might be a similarly special feel surrounding this group , but the circumstances were n't remotely the same . When the Phillies were averaging 38,374 fans per game in ' 07 , they were coming off a competitive 85-win season and second-place finish in the NL East . They had stars like Ryan Howard , who hit 58 home runs and was named Most Valuable Player in 2006 , along with Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins . People love offense , and that team delivered . In ' 07 , the Phillies were even still benefitting slightly from Citizens Bank Park being relatively new . The building opened four years earlier and was still by itself a draw . Most of all , they were already established as a competitive team , with many picking the Phillies a trendy pick to make the playoffs , and a lineup that would mash dingers . So many dingers . The 2018 Phillies were projected to be a .500 team , coming off years of losing , and competing with playoff-bound Sixers and Flyers squads the first month-and-a-half of the season . Even now , the Phils are still fielding a below-league average offense . Which is not to say the '18 Phillies have n't been fun . It 's just that they were easier to dismiss in April and May , when people were being treated to low-scoring affairs , few star performances and a rookie manager 's unorthdox approach to the game all while watching nervously to see if the wheels would come off . But the wheels never did come off , and , finally , the fans are coming around . No matter how the Phillies wrap this season up , the red hats are n't going back into hiding anytime soon , either . The Phillies are winning again , which means they 're interesting again . With a host of developing young players and leadership getting a taste of success , and a front office that has money to spend in free agency , the fans are also beginning to understand this season is only the beginning .",

		"paragraph": "Last Action Hero is one of the most confounding movies of all time . On paper , it should work . A genre-bending , fourth-wall-breaking parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger films starring the man himself seemed like a sure-fire blockbuster , arriving at the height of the actor s popularity in the early 90s . Yet , when the film was released on June 18 , 1993 , it bombed at the box office and became an immediate punching bag for critics . The backlash was so intense that then-President Bill Clinton became apologist in chief , stating , I do n t understand why the critics were so hard on this movie . I liked it myself . In honor of the 25th anniversary of the flop turned cult classic , Yahoo Entertainment sat down with the two men who dreamed up the film in the first place , Adam Leff and Zak Penn . During our 90-minute conversation , the screenwriters did n t hold back on what frustrated them about making the movie , and the movie itself . In 1991 , Adam Leff and Zak Penn were freshly graduated from Wesleyan University . They moved to Los Angeles and began working on their script for Extremely Violent , the initial title for Last Action Hero . Before he was named Jack Slater , their action hero went by Arno Slater , a not-too-subtle play on the reigning movie king , Arnold Schwarzenegger . Zak Penn : I guess [ we were writing ] a hybrid of action and parody . I think we spent a lot of time debating genres and what genre everything was . I spent a good month figuring out what genre it was . We really took it seriously . â€¦ We rented a good 40 to 50 movies and watched them through and just really immersed ourselves in the genre . Adam Leff : We watched Die Hard and Lethal Weapon and all the classics , but you were inundated with action movies in those days , in a way you re really not now . So it was all around you . Penn : We made up these question-and-answer sheets that said , Who s the second-most evil bad guy , and does he die last scene ? and When does it become personal ? and What s his weapon of choice ? and whatever . One of the things I remember being very funny was we watched all the Steven Seagal movies , and in one of them we got to the end , we realized he was wrong , like the whole movie , he d been wrong about who he was accusing . So technically everyone he had killed and beaten up was innocent , and he was the villain in his own movie . Leff and Penn sent their scripts to a few different agencies , hoping to gain some notice . Chris Moore at InterTalent Agency read it , loved it , and sold it . Leff : It all happened in one week . We went from being script readers to selling our first script in the course of seven days . And I think that was pretty fast , even for back then . We got an agent , Chris Moore , and then he partnered with Tom Strickler , and then we met with them once and then the next thing we knew , you know , they were taking the script out and we had two studios bidding for it . When we got that phone call Penn : Getting the phone call about the bidding and just realizing , Holy crap . We have money . â€¦ I do n t have to take out this lady s garbage anymore or read any of these terrible scripts . Leff : I remember that phone call on that day very well too . I think we were literally jumping off the floor and hitting the ceiling . It was very exciting . The two studios bidding for Leff and Penn s script were Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures , both divisions of the Sony Pictures . Leff : The unfortunate part was it was all Sony . Bidding against themselves . Penn : We thought we had sold it for $ 350,000 , and it ended up being $ 100,000 . When Arnold signed on , they redid our deal . Right off the bat , highs and lows . You know , like , incredible high and then , OK , we sold it , but for a third of what we told you , and you re fired . By the way . Leff : That came a little later . Before Leff and Penn were fired , they say they had a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger , the brass of Columbia Pictures ( including chairman Mark Canton and head of production Michael Nathanson ) , and the first writer hired to replace them , Lethal Weapon scribe Shane Black . However , they felt the meeting was only done as a courtesy . Penn : We did n t even get in the [ Writers Guild of America ] on Last Action Hero because we were never paid for a rewrite . [ Columbia ] acquired the script and then never hired us for a rewrite . Leff : It was discussed that we would do a rewrite . We were at a meeting with Arnold , Shane Black , Mark Canton , and Michael Nathanson , and all the Columbia brass . â€¦ In this meeting with Arnold , where we meet him for the first time , they are discussing the script . So we think , OK , great we re here to break out , you know , some ideas , see where there s weak spots . And Arnold says , I liked the first 42 pages . Then it gets a little flat . And we re like , Yep . Totally agree . First 42 pages . Great . Penn : We were told that , Yes , Shane is going to come in . He s going to supervise you . And then we went to dinner with Shane . He said , This is always going to be your script . And then at some hazy point we were just fired . Leff : Our agents told us just shut up and agree [ at the meeting ] . Which was good advice , and we did , and we got fired anyway , somehow . It was never clear that we got fired . Penn : Subsequently , I realized there was never any intention to have us do a rewrite because it was n t in our deal . That s very strange to buy a spec script and not have a rewrite as part of it . I think because things were moving so quickly it was just , Get rid of these guys . Bring in Shane . He ll deal with it . Leff : It seems really hard to believe now in 2018 , but Arnold Schwarzenegger was the largest box-office star in the world right then . Here , they had him on a hook with a script , that he wanted to do by these two nobody kids , and they ve got Shane Black interested in doing the rewrite . You know , Just get rid of the kids , get Shane in a room , get him to do the rewrite , and let s get Arnold on a stage , you know ? So that was kind of what they were thinking . Which I get . Black and his friend David Arnott were hired to rework the script . Eventually they would receive the writing credit . The Writers Guild decided to give Leff and Penn a story by credit . Meanwhile , Die Hard and Predator director John McTiernan signed on to direct the film . Leff and Penn were excited but wondered if he was the right fit . Leff : We were like , Holy s *** , this guy is the best . I mean , we were n t sure that he was going to know how to do the comedy of it but kind of figured he would . We were in no way disappointed . The guy was definitely top of the list of best action directors we could think of . Penn : When we originally wrote it , we were thinking [ Steven ] Spielberg , [ Robert ] Zemeckis Amblin was the idea we were going for . But that said , McTiernan had directed a number of really good movies , and they re not all the same . Die Hard is a very different movie than Hunt for Red October . ... But we were just like , They re making our movie ! This is amazing ! We were n t sitting there saying , They did n t get a good enough director . â€¦ We were kind of in awe that it was actually happening . While Leff and Penn admired McTiernan s work , he did n t respond in kind . In comments given to the New York Times in May 1993 , he said their first draft was n t very good and that it did n t have a spark . Penn : I ve been doing this a long time . [ Penn s subsequent credits would include X-Men 2 , The Incredible Hulk , The Avengers , and this year s Ready Player One . ] There s no need to insult somebody s script . I mean , talk about punching down . You know , we were we were at the bottom â€¦ Leff : The bottom of the food chain . Penn : Right . I mean the easier thing to say would have been , Wow such a great idea and , you know , A lot of wonderful moments . Leff : And We re going to go another direction for the second act . Penn : Not there yet . These guys are just started and God bless them . Leff : Not that John McTiernan needs me to come to his defense , because he clearly does n t , but the second half of our script as we originally conceived it was pretty bloody and pretty violent and pretty dark because the whole premise as we originally saw it was pretty dark . While Leff mostly stayed away from the set , Penn asked for and received a part . McTiernan s lack of generosity to Penn as a writer extended to Penn as an actor . Penn : I ca n t even believe they agreed to give me a part in the movie . I mean , I would n t ask for that now in a deal . But I was like , I want to get my SAG card , and they said , OK , you can have a small part . I think my character s name was like Grimmett or something . â€¦ I went in every day . I d get there at 6 a.m. It s embarrassing . I got there at 6 a.m. , that was the call time , and I would sit there and get into costume and then sit at a desk . It was probably six days in that [ cast member Colleen Camp ] pointed out to me , The camera is pointed that way , you re not in the frame . â€¦ After I found that out . I stopped acting very hard . But I had fun . I mean I had fun on the set . I learned a lot . Black and Arnott s rewrite helped convince McTiernan to come aboard the movie , but he was dissatisfied with the third act . Schwarzenegger did n t like the ending either , and so Columbia decided to look elsewhere for help on the script . Penn , however , was n t immediately aware that Black had been fired , and he says that played a part in their falling out . Penn : First of all you have to keep in mind â€¦ we were a year and a half out of college , so we did n t really know how things worked . I think we both felt like , OK , we came up with this story , we created it people are to want to get our opinion . I mean now it seems so silly now to say that when you see how Hollywood works . You understand that people do n t care about anyone s opinion . It does n t matter who you are , you could be a great author , they do n t care about your opinion . [ Shane ] did try to keep us involved . To his credit . He did send us pages and stuff . We were fairly critical of some of them , although we liked some of them too . I think some of the worst stuff came later . I would call Shane . I did n t know who else to call . And I would call him asking , When are we starting shooting ? Like , Are you going to go the first day , whatever . I did n t realize Shane had already been fired himself at that point . So I think when I called Shane and said , When is â€¦ where are they shooting the first day ? He said something to the effect of , Why the eff do you want to go to set ? This is n t your movie anymore . I was like , What did you say ? I think I hung up on him or I said something nasty back to him . And you just have to keep in mind , from my point of view , I was like , I thought , Oh this guy is our friend and he s here to help us . Which he was n t , and he was n t even on the movie anymore . At that point . So , I m sure his attitude was leave me alone . Schwarzenegger reportedly told Columbia if they hired Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Princess Bride writer William Goldman to rework the script , he d be their star $ 1 million later , Goldman agreed to give it an uncredited polish . Penn : What I remember distinctly hearing was that he was working on Danny s character . This could be total hearsay , so do n t hold me to this , but I remember reading the draft and seeing that there was a new starred page when he operates the crane . It said , In this moment , as he operates the crane , Danny goes from being a boy to a man . [ Editor s note : Leff said that line in unison with Penn . ] Penn : I think I remember saying to Adam , We ve been doing this wrong . If that s all you have to do , we should have written , And now the movie kicks into a higher gear that makes it great . By page 50 , you re going to love this . I just remember thinking , I ca n t believe that counts as a rewrite . I also ca n t believe that the great moment for our kid is operating a crane . That was something that just seemed shocking to me that , Oh yeah , I ve always wanted to get into an action movie so I could operate a crane . Leff : I have [ had social interactions with Goldman ] since . Very nice fellow . We ve had some laughs about the movie and some of the things that went wrong . I think he also came away from it with some battle scars . Yet , even the award-winning talents of Goldman could n t satisfy the team in charge . What followed was a parade of highly respected script doctors and at least one beloved space princess . Leff : There were seven writers on the project , by the end . Penn : I think maybe even more . Leff : It was this giant commercial juggernaut with the biggest box-office star in the world , and they , you know , they were just throwing money at writers . The biggest , highest-paid writers of the time . Bill Goldman , [ Highlander writer ] Larry Ferguson â€¦ Penn : Carrie Fisher . Leff : Did Carrie Fisher do a pass ? Penn : Yes , Carrie Fisher did a pass . â€¦ I did have an exchange with her once , and she laughed . [ She said ] , I do n t know why they paid me or what I did , but I did it . So . But who knows if it even made it in . Who knows ? â€¦ By the way , I still have no idea who wrote what in the movie . Leff : They said Larry Ferguson did the third act . Penn : Possible . The final project was a Frankenstein s monster of a script , assembled from different parts from different scripts from different writers with different visions . Penn : I remember talking about Commando as being a model of the movie we were making fun of and that Arnold s character [ would be ] an idiot he s kind of naive and that s partly what made the dynamic work . The kid understood everything , and he did n t . And [ Shane Black ] , who is a wonderful writer , is famous for writing the opposite type of character . You know , someone who s world-weary and cynical and knows everything . And that s kind of what the characters shifted into , which is no longer parodic . Now his character was as real as the kid s character was in the real world , and that , I think , skewed things . Leff : I think the final product is kind of a mix , right ? He s a little bit two-dimensional , you know , an action cardboard figure , but he is also Shane s witty , world-weary detective . It s a weird mix . â€¦ It was [ intended to be ] about a 16 - , 15-year-old kid who s miserable in school and disillusioned , has a single mom , and he goes to the movies for escape and he goes to the movies to feel empowered . And Arnold is the guy who gives him that power . I mean Danny , for instance â€¦ in my mind he was always like Keith Gordon from Christine , maybe a slightly younger Keith Gordon , but that s what we were going for . Angry young man , alienated young kid , awkward . Penn : Edward Furlong in T2 . Leff : Yeah . Not quite as good-looking . A slightly more sci-fi oriented kind of kid with some anger issues . If you take that , you know , it s not really a Robert Prosky , golden ticket kind of movie . â€¦ There was the worldliness of a Shane Black action detective movie layered on top of this really cheesy Disney film , and the souffl collapsed . Penn and Leff each named their specific issues with the final product . For Penn , it was the opening sequence in which Ripper ( Tom Noonan ) throws Slater s kid off a roof . Penn : Our opening sequence was this crazy chase through the Beverly Center , with [ Slater ] saving a kid with one hand and shooting a guy with another and doing something really silly and unrealistic . But â€¦ Oh no , I have a better idea . A horrible , frightening-looking burn victim-serial killer from Manhunter ... throws axes at him and then hurls his son off the roof to his death . Which of those sounds like a more fun opening for this movie ? And clearly it s the serial killer . Leff : I think the thing that I gagged on and still gag on today was the magic ticket , that golden ticket , the magic ticket . That just still kills me . What we had done in the original script is â€¦ the kid is sort of getting sucked through the screen . Penn : Right , there was a tear in the screen . Leff : There is a tear in the screen , and he s going up to inspect the tear and he actually kind of gets sucked into the movie , and you never really know exactly what happens . I do n t know , maybe that was n t great either , but to me it was better than a magic ticket , which which just makes me sick to this day . Leff and Penn also objected to the movie s ending , in which Danny finds himself at the mercy of Ripper and must be saved by Slater . PENN : Imagine if E.T. was about a kid who just got pushed around and never did anything and did n t help E.T. at all . That would not be effective . When you re writing a wish-fulfillment story , someone s wish needs to be fulfilled . Leff : His character never goes anywhere in the final version . Where we took his character might not have been the right place , in retrospect , I realize that 25 years later . We went way dark , but they probably could have taken it somewhere . Penn : In this , you really felt like he s barely doing anything . I mean he s meeting a girl who s too old for him . I do n t know . I mean we could go on for a while . We had a lot of , there s a lot of head-scratchers . You know , the animated cat obviously being one of them . I remember sitting in that premiere and just thinking , What s â€¦ why ? What s going on ? I thought , Who s running this show ? How did this happen ? But the writers did n t hate everything . Leff : There was a pyramid of Rottweilers that was very funny . Shane , I think , put that in . That was really funny . I do n t mean to minimize the rest of the movie , but that comes to mind . Penn : Our Hamlet sequence made it in intact , so we were very happy with that . I thought some of the Charles Dance [ Mr. Benedict ] stuff was quite good . And I liked the idea a lot that [ Mr. Benedict ] goes and gets villains from other movies . It just â€¦ I thought it was going to be King Kong and Dracula . I did n t realize he was going to be Death from The Seventh Seal . But , that idea that the villain would try to escape that s a good idea , that the villain is trying to escape from the movie . I think it s weird , but I like the video store scene â€¦ I think there s a lot of good little moments and good jokes here and there . When Last Action Hero hit theaters on June 18 , critics responded to it as poorly as Leff and Penn did . Commercially , it was a disaster and unable to challenge Steven Spielberg s Jurassic Park , which was in its second week of box-office dominance . Leff : [ joking ] We thought we were going to kill them . No . It was obvious that that was poor timing . Penn : It was insane â€¦ I was like , 23 , calling up and getting the head of the studio on the phone to complain â€¦ When we were kids , every summer there d be Time and Newsweek with Steven Spielberg on the cover and whatever movie he was coming out with . You just knew . That s what was going to happen â€¦ it s going to be a big hit . It just seemed incredibly self-destructive , almost . That s the only movie they had to avoid that summer . Leff : I still remember the Variety critic s review a joyless , soulless machine . Penn : That was a good review . The writers did n t put the full blame of the film s failure on Arnold Schwarzenegger . Leff : I think he , as much as anyone , was caught up in what was a giant commercial venture . I do n t think you could really see the forest from the trees . You were inside this thing , and you were just trusting everyone . You were trusting McTiernan , who was trusting Shane , who was trusting his partner , David Arnott . â€¦ I do n t think you can ascribe blame to any one person , and definitely not Arnold , who I feel like was just wearing the whole movie on his shoulders . Penn : He does give a good performance in the movie , weirdly . There s a number of scenes which are actually really well-acted on his part . I think surprisingly well-acted . I think he s a great performer , but he does n t normally give a full actor s performance . But I think he did in this movie . You ca n t expect Arnold Schwarzenegger to make sure that the movie does n t go off the rails creatively . â€¦ I mean , that s the real thing about Last Action Hero I found it very hard to watch . There s lots of good moments , but it really does n t hold together . While Last Action Hero might have been a flop , it was still a wonderful moment for the careers of Zak Penn and Adam Leff . The attention they received helped sell another script , PCU . Their first movie would be taken away from them and , depending on whom you ask , ruined . Their partnership would n t last . But still , they look back on those days fondly . Leff : Two guys writing out of Zak s bedroom . Drinking Diet Cokes and writing in the morning , playing tennis in the afternoon . Writing a script for Arnold Schwarzenegger , and it gets made by Arnold Schwarzenegger . It was insane . And yeah you know , gave us careers and it s incredible luck . So obviously we re grateful for that . Despite all this carping . Penn : It was fun to write . Writing is not normally fun , either . I mean , it s usually a pain in the butt . And that was fun to write . Leff : [ joking ] Last Action Hero 2 is in the works . Penn : I did not know that . Leff : [ joking ] I think it s a sequel that we should think about . I think we should get the team back together . â€¦ Let s make some calls , get this going . This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity .

		"paragraph": "The first thing you notice about Louis C.K. as he takes the stage for his new Netflix stand-up comedy special , 2017 , is that he s wearing a suit and tie . Yes , the tie is yanked down , the better to relieve blood pressure to a face that grows increasingly flushed even beet-red as he proceeds to talk about topics ranging from rescue pets to elementary-school teachers . The suit is probably a concession to both age and star prominence : He was getting both a bit long in the tooth ( I m 49 , I have two kids , he reminds us ) and too distinguished a filmmaker ( Horace and Pete , anyone ? ) to pull off his old , black T-shirt-and-jeans , just-trying-out-some-new-material-here persona . Turns out the suit is even more appropriate than expected , since Louis C.K. gets down to business right from the get-go . He leads off 2017 with a chunk of material about abortion . Good comedians have to stake out decisive positions on whatever topic they address , so it s intriguing to hear the way Louis C.K. navigates this hottest of topics . I think you should not get an abortion , he announces , but it turns out he s just pausing before adding , unless you need one . Another beat . In which case , you better get one . Whichever Fox News talking-head finally hears about this bit , which continues in an exceedingly blunt way of saying that women should control their own bodies I m guessing it ll be Bill O Reilly will probably heap outrage upon the comedian . As it is , Louis C.K. s audience here is more than willing to cheer on his train of thought even as it doubles back on itself . As a performer , Louis C.K. is n t prone to the kind of eloquent ranting Chris Rock does , nor does he paint vivid scenes the way Dave Chappelle does . He s very good at making jokes that are carefully constructed and timed down to the syllable sound like ordinary conversation . He adds to his growing catalogue of acute observations about marriage and raising children , and articulates some differences between middle-aged Louis and his more youthful self : Your circle of concern tightens , he observes . For example , he s very leery about rescue animals as pets , which he categorizes as unknown quantities he s not sure he trusts to leave alone with his children . His most interesting material here may be his musings on sexuality . He expresses admiration and envy regarding transgender people , who he thinks have figured out what it is about their identities that needs to shift to achieve happiness . He contrasts this with his own sagging self , lamenting that he s never felt comfortable in his own skin . He s also very funny about his reaction to the film Magic Mike , which he s watched many times , always with stirrings of arousal he finds pleasantly surprising . Rather than trade on the usual gay-panic joking that lesser comedians indulge in , Louis C.K. demonstrates what lifts him above so many other performers : An honesty he can bend into jokes that provoke laughter while also , perhaps , tapping into ideas and feelings his listeners may recognize in themselves .

		"paragraph": "Baghdad ( AFP ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has cancelled a visit to Iran , his press office said Sunday , as the premier came under strong Iranian criticism over his stand on renewed US sanctions against Tehran . Abadi will still go ahead with a planned visit to Turkey on Tuesday but has scrapped the Iran leg of the trip \" because of his busy schedule \" , his office said . An Iraqi official had said Saturday that Abadi would visit both neighbouring Turkey and Iran to discuss economic issues . According to Iraqi political sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , Iran initially agreed to the visit but changed its mind because it was unhappy about Abadi 's remarks . The premier said last Tuesday that Iraq -- which relies on neighbouring Iran as a source of cheap imports -- would reluctantly comply with US sanctions against Tehran that took effect the same day . \" We do n't support the sanctions because they are a strategic error , but we will comply with them , \" said Abadi , whose country is an ally of both Tehran and Washington . \" In general , sanctions are unjust . \" On Sunday , Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 's representative in Baghdad lashed out at Abadi as the Tehran visit was called off . \" These irresponsible remarks have already been condemned by many people . It 's a disloyal attitude towards the honest position of Iran and the blood of the martyrs this country has spilt to defend the land of Iraq \" against jihadists , said Moujtaba al-Hussein . \" We are saddened by this position which shows he has been defeated psychologically in the face of the Americans , \" he said . The US sanctions were reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers . In Tehran , the foreign ministry was more guarded about a possible visit by Abadi . A ministry spokesman said he had \" so far not received any official news or information whatsoever about this trip \" , the semi-official ISNA news agency reported .",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This interview for the Hostiles and Calamities episode of The Walking Dead contains spoilers . Say it is n t so : Eugene Porter has gone over to the dark side ?! That appears to be the path Abraham s BFF has chosen as he finds himself stuck with Negan and the Saviors at the Sanctuary . Especially since they are not treating him like their other hostages . Eugene s getting perks and privileges , dates with Negan s wives , access to any supply or snack he wants all because Negan sees Eugene s potential to create bullets and solve problems for the Saviors , using his Dr. Smartypants brain . Eugene portrayer and The Walking Dead fan favorite Josh McDermitt talked to Yahoo TV about Eugene s big adventure the character s best episode ever including where his loyalties have really settled , what s motivating his behavior right now , and the one sentence that really opened his mind to the possibilities of life with Negan . And yes , he also talked about Eugene s love of canned pasta , stale potato chips , and a funky little stuffed doll named Grimblygunk . Related : â€˜ The Walking Dead Recap : Fully a Man Apart Congratulations , Dr. Smartypants . This is the best Eugene episode ever . I mean , I would have to agree with that . And that s my new favorite nickname . Laura the Savior , she s calling me Haircut , which I always think is funny . She s just kind of bullying me around and everything . Creatively , she s not really straying from that . It s a solid nickname , but â€¦ Dr. Smartypants , it s stupid and it s funny and it s really the epitome of being a bully . It s just such a great name . I love it . It really is the best Eugene episode ever , because it s you , clearly , kind of delightfully running amuck with your performance . It s everything we love about the character in this one episode . Oh , thank you . I think it was a lot of fun to shoot . At this point in the season , a lot of the crew starts to jump onto other shows to keep putting food on the table for their family and that sort of thing . All of a sudden , I m showing up to work where I do n t know half the crew . The main decision makers are there . But I do n t know half the crew , and I m working with actors I ve never worked with before . I worked with Austin Amelio a little bit when I bit his crotch . Even then , we did n t know each other . It was like the first day I met him , Hey , nice to meet you , so this is where I m biting you . It was pretty quick . Jeffrey Dean Morgan , who I ve gotten to know a little bit outside of work , but had n t had a chance to work with him , it just felt very weird in a great way . It kind of threw me off my game in a wonderful way that I feel comes through in the performance a little bit , because Eugene was thrown off too . It s funny that you say we got to see him kind of run amuck in a delightful way , just like getting to do the things and hit those character traits about him that we ve all come to love . Anytime you can have Eugene sit down with women , and there s some flirtation going on , I think it s just amazing . This is a guy who thinks he s George Clooney , you know ? He thinks he has game . He does n t , but he ll tell you he does . He ll crash and burn and think that he walked away without injuries like , That was great . I m awesome . What did you think when you got this script ? I mean , I loved it from the start . When we got to the part where he says , I m Negan , I just pushed the script away from me , and I threw my arms up , and I went , Yes ! This show in its seventh season still surprises me at times . I was surprised in [ Hearts Still Beating ] when , unfortunately , Olivia was killed . I knew Spencer was coming , but I did n t know Olivia was about to die . I screamed then . I went , Oh , my god ! I love that , that this show is still fresh , and it s still keeping people on their toes . I thought it was an extremely well-written script . My hat s off to the writers . I was really , really happy with it , and it s not just a good Eugene episode , it s a good Dwight episode . This is a man who s completely beat down and broken . It s such a sad journey to watch . I mean , I was heartbroken when I saw the episode and he was in the house and he pulled the beer out and the pretzels . I lost it . It s so sad , you know ? That s the harsh reality of what this world is . Dwight continues to be a surprising character , who you feel empathy for . Yeah , absolutely . You can see how he s kind of torn between several masters . He wants to survive , as everyone does . He wants to please everyone . It s just sad to see him torn that way . David Leslie Johnson , he wrote an amazing episode . It was fun to have him on set and to chat with him about different things . It s interesting , with this show there s little tiny moments that you re like , Well , why did they leave this little part in the script ? It obviously has importance . Then , to talk with the writer and to find out , Oh , because this is setting up that or This is the importance here , I thought it was that all of a sudden , it s rounding everything out in the most wonderful way . Let s breakdown some of Eugene s funnier moments , of which there are many . He ca n t have lobster , so he ll take canned pasta . He wants potato chips , but not homemade ones , not fresh ones . What , for you , is the best part of that exchange between Eugene and Laura ? My favorite moment of that scene , of that little exchange within that scene , is the potato chips . Who would n t want fresh made potato chips ? They ve got a kettle , they re probably great , and he says no . It says an interesting thing about the character , because I think he s just very specific in his tastes . He s very set in his ways . It s just a preference thing . Look , you do n t get fresh potato chips anymore â€¦ even if they re still in the bag , which he prefers , they re probably stale by now . I do n t know , I guess it s something about when you eat them out of the bag , they taste better ? I do n t know that s what he s thinking , but it s funny to me that this guy is so set in his ways . The return of Easy Street : probably we re all going to hate it all over again , because we just finally got it out of our heads from the first half of the season . But , one man s torture song is another man s jam , which it turns out to be for Eugene . Is that the most Eugene has ever almost danced ? I think so . That s his go-to move , to bob his head the way he did . It s how he presents himself to the ladies . He s smooth , he s smooth . The fans will be happy to know that we shot a longer sequence to that . We edited off most of it so that hopefully it did n t get stuck in everyone s heads again . A longer version ? Does that mean there might be a DVD extra version that includes Eugene dancing ? No , I m not going to go as far as saying that . I mean just him bobbing his head for a longer period of time , and maybe like two minutes worth of music instead of five seconds or however long it ended up being . How long did you have to listen to Easy Street ? A lot . I had n t even heard the song yet when we shot the episode . I did n t know what the song was . I actually had a hard time keeping a straight face when I heard it , because I m like , This song s ridiculous . Everyone on set was pissed . They were like , Dude , we ve heard it so many times . We re sick and tired of it . I m like , It s not that bad of a song . Then , of course , on my way home from work , I was driving , and I usually drive in silence just so I can kind of decompress , but that song was stuck in my head . There s just something about it â€¦ it infiltrates your soul . The video game , Yars Revenge : Eugene really thinks this is the way that the ladies will be entertained , by watching him play this game . Had you actually played that game before ? I had an Atari growing up . I did not play that game , but I had many others . I said , Well , you know , so how are we going to do it ? They re like , Well , we ll have it , but do n t worry about it . It s going to be on a loop you actually do n t need to know how to play it . I told them , Look , in this moment , I am a method actor . I need to learn how to play this video game . I made them set it up for me and I came down on my day off work . I just sat in a room and played video games all day , like old school video games on the Atari . It was so rad . I was so happy I said that I needed to do that , because it was so worth it . Yeah , I love that Eugene thinks this is how you entertain ladies . He has a very specific set of rules of what he is and is not allowed to do with Negan s wives . He s never had a woman over to his apartment , let alone three . It s awkward . One of them touches his knee , and he kind of does n t know how he feels about that , especially I do n t want Negan to know . He just kind of moves his leg over awkwardly . Grimblygunk : who or what is a Grimblygunk ? I think that s a Scott Gimple thing . I do n t know where the name came from . I even asked him , or maybe I asked David Leslie Johnson , What s the deal with this name ? They were just like , I do n t know â€¦ it s just a Grimblygunk . We just came up with the name . I feel like there s a lot of things in Eugene s past that he is trying to grab on to , that hold significance . The justification , I was n t told why . There s certain things I specifically ask , Do n t tell me , unless I need to know , so that I can have the freedom to make a choice on my own . With that , I just felt like there was something in his childhood that reminded him of that , and he just grabbed it . Every one of these characters is desperately trying to hold on to something in their pasts . This is something that he probably saw . There was a little teddy bear that I had growing up . It was actually called a Joshua bear . Once I grew out of the age of having a teddy bear , I did n t need it anymore , it would just sit on this little wooden bench in our home . It would just sit there , like it was on display . As an adult , I would see pictures and I would see the Joshua bear sitting there , and I m still just like , Aww . Like , I get really nostalgic , and I just want to go pick it up . I do n t know , part of me believes that s what he felt with Grimblygunk . It may not be exactly the same thing from his past , but he wants it . It s like a security blanket to him . We end up seeing it later in the episode , when it s tucked in his jacket pocket . It s like , we have a hard time taking you seriously , [ and now ] you ve got a stuffed animal hanging out of your pocket , and you re eating a pickle , and you re yelling at guys . What is going on , man ? He grabbed a bed pan , too . I m just glad they did n t make me shove that in my pocket . Okay , delving into the serious moments for Eugene : it appears that Eugene has pledged his allegiance to Negan . At first , maybe we think he s doing it just to survive , which is obviously a very good reason , but he does n t just say , I am Negan , he says , I am utterly , completely , stone cold Negan . Has he really gone over to Team Negan ? That I do n t know . Again , there are certain things that I ve asked , Do n t tell me . Please , do you mind not telling me unless I need to know ? That was one of them . I did n t want to know the answer to that , because I would end up playing it . I would play it with a wink or I would play it with too much seriousness or whatever . I just wanted to play it truthfully for that moment . I obviously made some decisions for myself , which I m going to keep for myself , I m not going to share with people . The thing that s interesting is , we ve been watching this man grow over the last few seasons into a man of action , a man who has confidence , who can step up and contribute to the group . All that was shattered when they met Negan , and he killed a couple of Eugene s friends . They were all trying to pick up the pieces and figure out who they were in this world and how they can move forward from that point , Eugene especially . He was so scared and so fearful of Negan â€¦ those feelings that were coursing through his veins . He hated it . He hated it so much . So in the moment where he says , I m Negan , that s an important moment for sure , but there s a moment before that line when Negan says , Hey , you do n t have to be scared anymore . That s like a hit of crack to Eugene , because I think that s all he wants . He s just breathing that in , just like , Oh , my gosh , this is literally all I want . I think that s what allows him the freedom to cut off Negan mid-sentence , which is a bold thing to do , and just profess his love right there . I feel like it s a question that people are going to be asking themselves . This show always asks questions as they pertain to our own lives and society as we put ourselves in these characters shoes . Like , If this apocalypse were to happen , who would I be like ? Would I be like Michonne ? or , Oh , I d be more like Abraham , or whatever . I think this is something where people would ask like , If I were in Eugene s shoes , what would I do ? Would I say â€˜ I m Negan , or would I be like Daryl ? Daryl s a strong individual , but I think a lot of people would be like Eugene , scared and hoping someone protects them â€¦ might lie about having a cure and things like that . Are you really going to say that you would stand up to this man and say , I m not Negan , and just keep getting fed dog food sandwiches and stuff like that ? Negan s providing a pretty nice life for Eugene right now . It remains to be seen how this is all going to play out , but it s very exciting . It s also a little scary , I ll be honest . The other thing is that when he was last in Alexandria , Rick was still very much in his dejected state . He was n t the newly hopeful leader that Rick has become in the second half of the season , deciding to fight back and try to get this army together . Eugene knows that Daryl escaped , but he has no reason to believe anyone came to help Daryl . In Eugene s mind , he does n t necessarily have any reason to believe that they re going to make an effort to come and get him or help him escape from there , either . Right . Yes , because they did n t do it for Daryl . Like you said , he does n t know that Rick s turned a corner , that he feels like there s a little bit of hope , and they can fight this guy . You ca n t blame Eugene for trying to do what he can do . He s not just going to say , Oh , I ll just put up with your torture , because I know my people are going to come in here eventually , two years from now , when they finally get their act together . It s survival of the fittest , and you ve got to take care of yourself . What is Eugene thinking when Negan tosses Dr. Carson into the fire ? Negan is very definitely trying to make a point to him , that he wants Eugene to witness this , because this was another guy who he had put a lot of faith in and depended on . Absolutely . I also think that with Eugene s intelligence , another one of his assets is he s able to read a room very quickly and size people up . I think he put it together , as we found out later â€¦ he knew that Dwight sacrificed the doctor to survive . He was n t going to let Negan s wives sacrifice him to survive . He s going to make sure that does n t happen , because we all have to look out for ourselves . I think that s a clear moment that he also realizes that he s being played by these women . He was blinded by lust for a moment . I agree Negan was definitely trying to make a point , but I do n t think there s a point that needs to be made . Eugene knows that Negan s a bad guy . He s seen the atrocities that this man has committed . You do bring up an interesting point , that here s a man that Negan trusts , and yet he s still going to kill him . Even though Eugene might feel the trust from Negan , or that trust starting to build , you have to remember you re never on solid ground around this guy . Your castmates , and the producers , all keep saying the Season 7 finale is unlike any other season finale the show has done . How would you describe the season finale ? I would agree with that assessment . We always go out big . We re building toward some things , and I think there s going to be a convergence of a lot of storylines at one point , whether or not that s in the finale remains to be seen . That was a difficult episode to shoot on many levels , not least of which I felt like we had a shortened time to prepare for it . I do n t remember exactly why , but you usually get X number of days to prepare . It just felt like the episode was so big we did n t have enough time . That s not a bad thing . I m not saying that in a bad way . It s just that big . What can you say about Eugene for the rest of the season ? Well , he s certainly in an interesting place now . I think we can start calling him Negan we can stop calling him Eugene , or at least call him Dr. Smartypants . I think he s going to start getting adjusted to his new life at the Sanctuary . He s always going to have to stay on his toes . I think some of his decisions will be put to the test . What s your favorite Eugene line of the episode ? There are so many good ones . It s I m Negan . That s it . I ve been asked a lot by fans , What s your favorite line of the series ? It really would differ depending on my mood , but I loved it when they were in the machine shop last season , and he called dibs on killing that walker . He said , Dibs is dibs , like there is some sort of code that this man lives by . I always thought that was hilarious , but then when I read , I m Negan , I went , This is my favorite line . I was teasing the fans , I said , I do n t know what episode it s going to come in , but you ll know it when you hear it . My favorite line is coming up . I just do n t know what s going to top , I m Negan . And it s not just , I m Negan . He s very emphatic . He , as you said , interrupted Negan , which you just do n t do . You do n t do . It s word vomit . He just like spilled everything out all over Negan s red scarf and said , I m yours , buddy . The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .

The 24-year-old issued the following apology Sunday , saying that he totally regrets his actions : Moscon already had a poor reputation coming into the competition . During the 2017 Tour de Romandie , he used racial slurs in the peloton again rider Kevin Reza , and was subsequently suspended from Team Sky for six weeks .

		"paragraph": "Kanye West wants to clear the air with Drake . Tensions have been running high between the rappers for months , and in a Twitter spree early Wednesday morning , West apologized to the In My Feelings crooner , explaining where the confusion started . It seems their disagreement comes down to three things : Kim Kardashian s husband encroaching on Drake s Scorpion release date , West releasing Lift Yourself on his own album , and the material used in Pusha T s dis tracks aimed at Drake ( cough : secret love child ) . Apparently , it started in April when Drake announced that his highly anticipated album Scorpion would be out in June . Six days later , West announced the release date of four albums he was producing for Pusha T , Nas , Kid Cudi , and Teyana Taylor plus the release of his own album , Ye . All dropped between May 25 and June 22 . West now apologizes for stepping on Drake s toes , alluding to the fact he might not have been in the best frame of mind at the time . West also issued a mea culpa for including Lift Yourself on Ye . ( In a recent interview , Yeezy said Drake wanted to be on the beat and sent him purple demon emojis when it did n t happen . ) But perhaps the biggest source of tension stems from Pusha T going after Drake and Yeezy doing nothing to stop it . It started on Pusha T s song Infrared , produced by West , in which he inferred that Drake uses a ghostwriter , Quentin Miller . ( The lyric : It was written like Nas but it came from Quentin . ) Drake responded with a dis track of his own , Duppy Freestyle , which mentioned Pusha T s fianc e . Pusha T then fired back with The Story of Adidon , calling out Drake s secret love child . Did you catch all that ? West apologized for all of it , but clarified he had nothing to do with Pusha T going after Drake s son , saying he learned his lesson that kids are off limits after his 2016 feud with Wiz Khalifa . West ended his tweets by praising Drake s success and said he s going to catch the rapper on tour . West s apology comes after a conspiracy theory that the musicians feud really started because Drake hooked up with Kardashian and that she s Kiki from In My Feelings . However , the reality star shut down the rumor this week , saying it never happened . West likely decided to try and squash the beef because Drake disses him in a forthcoming song with French Montana . His tweets came hours after a snippet hit the internet featuring Drake rapping : I told her do n t wear no 350s around me , referencing West s Yeezy 350 sneakers . Was this enough to end their feud for good ? Drake has yet to publicly respond , but we ll probably hear from him soon . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "ANAHEIM , Calif. ( AP ) -- Shohei Ohtani was removed from his start for the Los Angeles Angels after four innings Wednesday night because of a blister on his pitching hand . It was the second time this season Ohtani left a game due to a blister on his right middle finger . He gave up three runs in two innings before exiting against Boston on April 17 , but did not miss his next turn in the rotation . This time , Ohtani allowed one run on four hits and three walks during Los Angeles ' 4-3 win over the Kansas City Royals . He struck out four but did not get a decision . Angels manager Mike Scioscia did not believe Ohtani 's blister was as bad as the one against the Red Sox . However , the skipper refused to commit when asked if Ohtani would be able to make his next start as scheduled . The two-way rookie star from Japan warmed up to start the fifth inning , but catcher Martin Maldonado called for a trainer . Scioscia also went to the mound to check on Ohtani , who eventually walked back to the dugout . '' Bottom line is he started to feel it and it was time to get him out , '' Scioscia said . Scioscia grew concerned when Ohtani 's secondary pitches started to become less effective in the third and fourth .

		"paragraph": "We might be down to the last Jedi , but that galaxy far , far away still has plenty of stories to tell . Lucasfilm announced Thursday afternoon that Rian Johnson , the writer-director behind the upcoming Star Wars : The Last Jedi , will create a completely new trilogy that wo n t focus on the extended exploits of Luke Skywalker but will instead introduce characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored . Johnson , who turned down a chance to direct 2019 s Episode IX , the final film in the Skywalker Saga , which will wrap up the story that George Lucas started in 1977 , will team with his longtime producing partner , Ram Bergman , for the new venture . No plot details have been announced , nor have any release dates for the films , but all parties are predictably stoked . We all loved working with Rian on The Last Jedi , Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said in a statement . He s a creative force , and watching him craft The Last Jedi from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career . Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy . We had the time of our lives collaborating with Lucasfilm and Disney on The Last Jedi , Johnson and Bergman added in a joint statement . Star Wars is the greatest modern mythology , and we feel very lucky to have contributed to it . We ca n t wait to continue with this new series of films . Thursday has proved to be momentous for Force fanatics . In addition to the announcement of the Johnson-helmed trilogy , Disney boss Bob Iger revealed that a live-action TV series set in the Star Wars universe would arrive on the studio s forthcoming streaming service in 2019 to coincide with the release of Episode IX and the opening of the Star Wars : Galaxy s Edge lands at Disney theme parks .

Just last spring , the royal pair was the center of attention at their own marriage celebration in the very same spot . But this week they ceded center stage to Harry s cousin and her groom although Harry and Meghan did appear to break one protocol with the way that they entered the chapel , continuing their own tradition of doing things their own way . When the Sussex duo attends official events alongside Prince William , Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton , Duchess of Cambridge , family hierarchy generally dictates that Harry and Meghan step back and let the future king and his wife proceed first . Here , you can view the full royal family tree . But in this case , they did n t follow this de facto rule , and went on in to the chapel in advance of Will and Kate after exiting their car . ( This time , Meghan did not close the car door herself so at least that s one controversy evaded . ) Prince William and Kate apparently arrived soon after , and joined the Duke and Duchess of Sussex inside for the ceremony , also attended by celebrities like Cara Delevigne and Naomi Campbell and , of course , plenty of royals , including Queen Elizabeth II .

		"paragraph": "With 10 minutes remaining in their 2018 World Cup opener , and goals still eluding both , Morocco and Iran knew that a draw would not do them any good . With Spain and Portugal looming in Group B , each team knew that Friday s match was their best shot at three points . Each knew that it needed a goal . And Morocco , in dramatic fashion , got it . Unfortunately , Aziz Bouhaddouz scored that goal at the wrong end . In the 95th minute the fifth of six minutes of stoppage time Bouhaddouz mistakenly powered a diving header into his own net : The own goal gave Iran its second-ever victory at a World Cup , and first of the 21st century . It also completely overhauled the equation in Group B. Friday s battle of European giants , which kicks off an hour after Morocco s nightmarish error , is now extremely important . The Group B showdown between Spain and Portugal was already the group stage s headliner . But Iran s victory raised the stakes . Because the loser of Friday s clash of favorites , if there is one , is no longer a favorite . And that matters , because the loser is not only staring at a three-point deficit . In a miniature three-game round robin , game state principles apply to the group as a whole . If Portugal beats Spain 2-0 , Iran wo n t just sit above the Spaniards in the Group B table Iran will essentially be playing with a lead from kickoff when it meets Spain on Matchday 2 . Spain will know it must win , or else it ll be left to hope for help , and to overturn a three-goal differential on the final day . Iran will be able to play as if it has a lead . And that s when Team Melli excels . Similar dynamics could be in play on Matchday 3 if Portugal is the loser on Friday . And the Portuguese especially are ill-equipped to play from behind . At the very least , there will be pressure on Spain and Portugal to avoid a heavy defeat on Friday . Either can probably afford to lose 1-0 . They ca n t afford to lose 4-0 like Portugal did against Germany in its 2014 World Cup opener , a defeat that ultimately condemned it to a group stage exit . Iran , the biggest underdog in the group , is suddenly a contender for a knockout round berth . And if things break right , it might just need one more point to pull off the biggest upset of the World Cup . Henry Bushnell covers global soccer for Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ? Question ? Comment ?

		"paragraph": "The NFL season is inching closer . Through July , Shutdown Corner will examine three big questions for each NFL team as it heads to training camp . New Orleans Saints Report date : July 19 ( rookies ) , July 26 ( veterans ) Location : Metairie , La . 1 . Is this Drew Brees last camp as a Saint ? That nervous laughter you hear rolling up out of the bayou is the chittering of Saints fans who are slowly realizing that Brees is only playing on a one-year deal that he signed last offseason . Brees , cruising quietly in Tom Brady s wake , remains a quietly dominant quarterback , throwing for over 5,000 yards as recently as , well , last season . Come 2018 , Brees is going to want to get paid bigly , even though he ll be entering his age-39 season next year . So all eyes will be on Brees this year , watching for any signs of dropoff , any tics that would justify ( or not justify ) paying an aging-but-still-viable QB a gargantuan final deal . Oh , and the best non-Brees QB currently on the roster ? That would be Chase Daniel , who has thrown exactly one more touchdown in his career than you have . Yeah , it s safe to say that Brees will be a topic of discussion in Louisiana from now until next spring . 2 . Who s the alpha dog out of the backfield ? Right about now , the Saints have the best fantasy backfield of 2011 , with newcomer Adrian Peterson lining up beside Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram . Throw rookie Alvin Kamara , a third-round pick out of Tennessee , into the mix and oooo-weeee , you ve got you a tasty running back gumbo ! ( It s a law that you have to mention gumbo in any article involving the Saints . ) That s a pretty serious thunder-lightning-hail attack for a team that happens to have one of the greatest passers in NFL history on its roster . The Artist Formerly Known As Purple Jesus is keen to prove that his best days are n t years behind him , so the key for the Saints will be figuring out which situations work best for his and Ingram s skill sets . What s Peterson got left in the tank after a decade in the league and 2,400 carries on his legs ? We re about to find out . 3 . Who s healthy on the line ? Not as many people as New Orleans would like . All that QB genius and running-back talent is n t worth much if the defensive line beats the ball into the backfield , and it s here that the Saints have some real concerns . Pro Bowl center Max Unger is sidelined after foot surgery he hopes to be back for Week One , but that s by no means a definitive . Two slots down , monster left tackle Terron Armstead injured his shoulder during OTAs and is out for at least a good chunk of the season . Those are two key components of the Saints offensive attack without them at full strength , New Orleans is going to be scrambling far more than it should . The training camp battle to replace/understudy them as well as defensive tackle Nick Fairley , out all season with a heart ailment will be fierce , and one well worth watching .

That much was clear when Bauer attempted to pitch through a painful cut on his pinky finger against the Toronto Blue Jays in the playoffs . Bauer even considered cauterizing the wound with a soldering iron just so he could take the mound . It should n t come as a surprise that he s persistent . [ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Baseball | 2017 Player Rankings ] That quality apparently extends off the field as well . Bauer proved as much after sending out a tweet about criticizing Apple and Twitter for only sending him negative Donald Trump articles on his phone . Here s Bauer original tweet : Since Bauer mixed sports and politics , there was sure to be an immense response to that tweet . Turns out , Bauer was ready for that . In the ensuing hours , Bauer responded to literally hundreds of tweets about his original comment . Those responses varied in nature . Bauer tweeted fist pump emojis at fans who supported him , told fans who were unfollowing him good riddance , addressed his thoughts on climate change , declared himself one of the most scientific players in MLB and questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the United States . That s a wide-range of topics . Some of them make sense considering his initial tweet , while others seem far removed from his complaint . So , how long does it take for a baseball player to get from tweeting about liberal media bias to addressing climate change ? Do n t worry , we counted for you . 135 tweets ! Yes , since Bauer s original tweet , he s sent out 135 responses to fans and critics defending his position . Like we said before , he can be persistent . There s a chance that figure will continue to grow , obviously . Bauer is no stranger to tweeting about politics and engaging people on social media . During the first Democratic debate last January , Bauer said he was appalled at what he was hearing .

		"paragraph": "Welcome back , Bachelor Nation ! I ca n t believe it s already here . The week of hometown dates is always such a big shift . First of all , it s hard to imagine that there are only 4 women left in this situation , when we started with 30 . It s crazy to see how far those relationships have come and to see the women decide to bring Nick back to their hometowns to meet their families . Related : â€˜ The Bachelor Hometown Dates Recap : Impossible Decisions Before we get too far into it , I just want to thank all of the families for letting us into their homes . We know it s a big deal to open up your lives , and we really and truly appreciate it . These relationships are real , and hometown dates are a big part of allowing these love stories to fully blossom . Raven s family is as adorable as can be . I think it would be inhuman to not shed a tear while watching this hometown . This close family had really great news that day and shared it with Nick . I think Raven s relationship with her family , and especially her father , really show us how she became the person she is . And there s nothing more fun than four-wheeling around and pulling a From Here To Eternity in your local swamp . But please , make sure the water is clean before replicating this activity . Next we were off to Dallas to meet Rachel s family . I think this was a very exciting date for Nick , who got to experience some new things and got to address some really interesting topics with Rachel and her family . Rachel s father is a federal judge and so could not appear on our television show , but you should know that Nick and Rachel s father did get a chance to talk before he left that night . This date was a huge step forward for Rachel , who obviously was falling in love with Nick but she s also a realist , and wanted to gut check her feelings against the perspective that her family could provide . Obviously , sometime soon , things go in a different direction for Rachel , but for the time being , this relationship is strong and growing . I think we ve all been dying to meet Corinne s family , especially Raquel , who has been much discussed all season long . It was really nice to see where Corinne came from . Her family is high energy and funny and also really serious about her finding love , including Raquel . It was also great to see Corinne taken out of the competitive environment and allowed to thrive on her own . Everyone has many different sides , and part of dating is exploring those sides . I really think Nick learned a lot about Corinne this week . And I heard Raquel taught Nick some recipes he can use to keep Corinne happy if they end up together . And finally , Nick visited our friendly neighbor to the North , Canada . Vanessa took Nick to her school to meet some of the people she works with . It really was wonderful for all of us to get to see Vanessa in her natural element . She is a nurturing and a caring person and I think Nick really got to see Vanessa at her most confident . Vanessa s family , though , like many in hometown history , really wanted to make sure that Nick was n t going to hurt her . I think we can all relate to wanting to protect the ones we love most , but in the end it seems as if Vanessa s students and her family both granted their approval . I think that s all she needed . We went back to New York for the Rose Ceremony , and Nick certainly had his hands full . Four amazing women . Four wonderful families . These decisions are nearly impossible at this point . But sometimes before you can take steps into your future , it s important to look into your past . And the past came knocking . Next week , you ll find out why .

		"paragraph": "The world of \" Scandal \" is a dangerous one , which means anyone can die at any moment . Still , it was a tremendous shock to see the resolution of last week 's humongous cliffhanger did Jake shoot James ( Dan Bucatinsky ) or David ( Josh Malina ) ? It turned out that Jake ended up shooting and killing James . And that tragedy will undoubtedly cause major ripple effects on Cyrus ( Jeff Perry ) , Olivia ( Kerry Washington ) , and the entire Gladiator crew . [ Related : Catch Up on ' Scandal ' With Our Tweet-caps ] Bucatinsky , who won an Emmy as a guest star on \" Scandal , \" talked with Yahoo TV about the stunning turn of events when he knew , how he was told , what the reactions of cast members were . And he chatted about what 's next on the horizon . How did you find out that James was getting killed off ? Sometime in mid-January , I got a call from Shonda . This was a few days after we had all done a table read of the episode prior , where you do n't know if Josh or I are going to drop . So after that table read , everybody was scrambling with ideas and thoughts with what might happen . I do n't even think the writers had thought through it . In some shows , you have this big , mapped-out idea of the entire season and you know when people are doing what and when . But on \" Scandal , \" there 's such explosive storytelling every single week that I think they were n't positive how they were going to finish the story which one of us would drop , would both of us drop , would neither of us drop ? It was really up in the air . So , as the days progressed , it became more and more tense for Josh and I. Then , I got a call from Shonda to let me know that they had to stay true to the story , that they thought of every other possibility , and the only one that felt organic to what they 'd been building was that James would have to die . [ Related : Welcome to Tony Goldwyn 's Jungle ] It was hard news , and it took me awhile to process . But I 've had a nice long time now from the time I was told , and then I got the script , and we shot the script and have had a lot of opportunities to mourn it and spend time with my castmates and get through it . It really was a mourning process , and not just because I 'm leaving the show and leaving people I love , and also mourning the character , who I 've become very fond of . How do you think James 's death will affect Cyrus and everyone else ? For me , to speculate about how they 're going to write it , I have no idea . I 've always told Jeff that the scenes we got to play together brought so many different colors to his character that were beyond what he was capable of in the White House . His thirst for power and his devotion and love for the president and all of his political shenanigans were one side of him . But there was this other side of him that James brought out . But as Cyrus pimped out his husband , we 've always seen a very dark side of Cyrus . And I feel like the mourning of his husband and his first authentic love is something that I hope in future episodes we see play out . The \" Scandal \" cast is very close . How did they react to your departure ? It was big news . I think a lot of people just did n't imagine that they would really do it . I was sort of encouraged and comforted by that thought . Then when I found out that it was happening , Shonda sent a letter to the cast , and I got a lot of shocked and supportive emails . On the one hand , everyone acknowledged that it was an amazing story what a turn , what a twist ! For the show to do something with a beloved character like that continues to fuel an audience fervor that this show has . They kind of owe it to the audience , even if I hate it [ laughs ] ! Even if it 's to my detriment , people need to know that kind of thing is possible . My cast members were all sad and have expressed that a lot over the last month , and have talked about how to keep our friendship alive for many years to come . [ Related : ' Scandal ' Recruiting ' Lost ' Alums : Is Shonda Rhimes a Lostie ? ] What was it like shooting your last episode ? It must 've been very emotional . It was hard to shoot , but also woven in there were all these lovely , fun , flirtatious flashbacks . The final scene was one of the hardest things I 've ever experienced personally or professionally . The level of reality I had to lie on the ground , gag , eyes opened , for long periods of time , underneath this sheet . It 's kind of a metaphysical , existential idea of being aware of one 's own death . I remember feeling like , \" Oh my god , this is what is to be a body on the ground . \" It was hard . And the final scene with Scott Foley is something that bonded us for probably forever . It was very difficult , every emotional . We did it many , many times , until 2 o'clock in the morning . And it was the final thing I did on the scene . It ca n't be easy to get killed off , but you are walking away from this with an Emmy . Of course . Yes , I 'm disappointed , I would 've loved to stay on the show for years to come . I really loved getting to play that material and the cast . I feel very blessed to have done 27 episodes of a part that started so simply and without any real hint that it was going to develop the way it did . I 'm a very lucky guy . And the Emmy on top of that is all just gravy . I feel like it 's also awakened in me a love for acting that I came out to Los Angeles with , but I wound up taking different career turns . I 'm eager for the next chapter . Speaking of the next chapter , we just saw the announcement that you 'll be joining the pilot for \" Marry Me , \" from the creator of \" Happy Endings . \" It 's such a funny pilot . David Caspe is such a talented writer . It 's one of the few pilots I 've read in the past five years that 's as funny as it is , and I just wanted to be a part of it . And Casey Wilson having two dads , a ) is just a great idea , and b ) that Tim Meadows and I would be her dads [ laughs ] ... arguing about which of our sperm actually impregnated the surrogate , when , to at least one of us , is completely obvious [ laughs ] . It 's fun , and it 's a complete challenge . It 's a much older character than I am . While it 's not a departure of me to play the husband of another man , I do think it 'll be fun to be on a comedy . [ Related : Big Stars Headlining the Latest TV Pilots ] Is it a total mindtrip to go from an intense , crazy drama like \" Scandal \" to something more light and fun ? It really is .

		"paragraph": "Yards per passing attempt is the foundation for quarterback performance . It s the reason why since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger teams that win YPA by any margin have won about three quarters of games . But YPA does n t just predict wins and losses . It also predicts the quarterback stat that we care most about in fantasy with our signal-callers : passing touchdowns . The TD % of attempts for quarterbacks closely tracks YPA . Last year , 17 of 30 qualifying QBs ( 224 attempts ) had a variance in these two stats , adjusted for league average where 100 is exactly average , of just seven points . The bottom line : YPA is the dog and TD % is the tail . If a QB has a much stronger TD % ( and thus number of TD passes ) than his YPA , he has n t really earned them and last year s total has less predictive weight . And if he s sporting a much stronger YPA than TD % , he was probably just very unlucky in converting touchdowns last year and thus is a good bet to do much better now . Why is n t the higher TD % the number to bet on instead of the YPA ? Because you always bet the bigger sample . Last year , we applied YPA to quarterbacks and concluded that Cam Newton , Blake Bortles , Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Carr would throw far less TDs on a percentage basis . We were right on all but Carr , who was down but still close enough to the prior year to count as a miss . So three of the four predicted busts were correct . ( Note we clearly said to ignore the model on Aaron Rodgers and Eli Manning . ) The top buy in last year s column was Matt Ryan , who we said was THE late-round QB to get last year given he was available often in the last round of 12-team leagues . We also said the two other values were Ben Roethlisberger ( TD rate spiked dramatically as predicted , 4.5 % to 5.7 % ) and Jameis Winston ( 4.1 % to 4.8 % ) . While both of them were hits , they almost seem like misses compared with that top-line call to buy Ryan at 2016 ADP . He finished with an NFL best 7.1 % TD rate and 9.26 YPA among QBs with the minimum amount of attempts . No one was really drafting Fitzpatrick with a serious pick so let s just cross him out . And Roethlisberger was not an ADP bargain either . So relative to ADP , four hits and one miss . That s pretty good . Let s see if we can repeat it with this year s outliers . The major buy on the board is Washington QB Kirk Cousins . He earned about a 5.8 % TD % last year , meaning he should have tossed 35 touchdowns . Few are treating him as a QB of that caliber this draft season ( current ADP of 100 ) . So , always gamble when it s free . Cousins is a top-tier QB at a second-tier price even with the loss of DeSean Jackson . Note that red-zone efficiency has no correlation that I can find year to year and Cousins , who was among the worst last year , was among the best in 2015 . Similarly , Russell Wilson should be expected to have a much better TD rate but that s being priced into his ADP of 59.8 . Similarly , the market is hip to Andy Dalton achieving much greater TD value this year and that s justified given his 21-point spread between his good YPA and poor TD % . Dak Prescott is such a public player that there are no bargains with him but his TD rate also should have been between 5 % and 6 % so let s call it 26 expected touchdowns . But note that the Cowboys are probably going to have to throw much more with a tougher schedule this year . This is more of a Buy Dez Bryant stat though , given his expected market share of Prescott TDs . The major takeaway : Make Cousins your QB this year . It s not going to cost you much to see if this model is right . The sells are similar to last year . But we ignore the variance ( higher TD % than YPA ) of Rodgers because his offense is absurdly pass-TD friendly . Note he had nine TDs on first or second down inside the opponent s 3-yard-line last year , easily leading the league . ( Next were Matthew Stafford at 7 , Drew Brees 6 and Andrew Luck with 5 . ) Plus Rodgers has been historically a great YPA QB . So fading him for this reason is silly . And Carr is not going to burn me again . His YPA is slowly moving in the right direction and should be at least average this year at this rate of improvement he has beaten the model two years in a row regardless . The one sell again is Bortles , who I understand somehow scored about as well as Winston last year . But he is just a terrible player . You ca n t tolerate a YPA + of 77 where 100 is average . Even though his TD % was below average it should have been horrific as it would have been had he not gotten all those garbage time TDs when defenses barely cared . That s likely coming . Bortles should have thrown 16 TD passes instead of 23 last year in 625 attempts ( or about the actual rate of the similarly efficiency deprived Carson Wentz ) . So avoid Bortles and more importantly Jaguar receivers paying ADP for Allen Robinson in light of this data is simply absurd .",

		"paragraph": "GOLETA , Calif. ( AP ) The Latest on the wildfires around the West ( all times local ) : 8:52 a.m. Three people have been arrested for allegedly starting a Colorado wildfire by leaving an unauthorized campfire unattended . The Teller County Sheriff 's Office says Monday that 23-year-old David Renfrow , 19-year-old Kegan Owens and a 17-year-old boy were arrested in connection with a fire that has destroyed at least eight homes . It 's not clear if they have lawyers yet . The Chateau Fire in the state 's south central mountains has burned about 2 square miles ( 5 square kilometers ) but all evacuated residents have been allowed to return home . It 's one of 10 large wildfires in Colorado . The largest , the Spring Creek Fire , has destroyed over 130 homes and is 70 percent contained . A fire pit that was n't completely extinguished is suspected of starting that 168 square mile ( 435 square kilometer ) fire . 7:30 a.m. Crews have gained some ground against a deadly wildfire burning on the California-Oregon state line that killed a man and injured three firefighters . California fire officials say the blaze is 30 percent contained as of Monday morning . The fire , one of many in the drought-ridden U.S. West , killed one person in their home and destroyed 72 structures . It also injured three firefighters , including one who had severe burns to his face and had to be hospitalized . CalFire says the firefighter was released Sunday from UC Davis hospital burn center in California . The blaze that started Thursday near the community of Hornbrook has scorched 55 square miles ( 142 square kilometers ) . It jumped into Oregon over the weekend . Authorities say a wildfire that shut down Interstate 580 in the San Francisco Bay Area on Sunday night is fully contained and all lanes have reopened . 6:58 a.m. The battle against wildfires goes on across the West , but there is good news from one community scorched by flames . The last mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in the Goleta area of Southern California where a small but destructive fire burned during the weekend . Santa Barbara County authorities say residents were allowed back into the area Sunday evening , although firefighters continued to work on hotspots and not all electricity had been restored . An assessment of the burn area found that 13 single-family homes were destroyed , three homes were damaged , and 15 barns , workshops and sheds were lost .",

		"paragraph": "If it felt like the first game of an NBA Finals , it s because statistically this is about as obvious as NBA Finals previews pitched in the regular season tend to come . No two NBA teams in league history have met this late in the regular season with single-digit loss totals to their credit , as the West-leading Golden State Warriors and East-dominating Atlanta Hawks put on a Friday night show that deserved exposure that went far beyond the local viewers that were tuning in , and the League Pass-flaunting NBA obsessives who stayed home to tune in on what could have been a night out . Atlanta downed Golden State by a 124-116 score that perfectly summed up the back and forth . The Warriors , working on the road , were game in their competitive spirit but unable to close the gap , while the Hawks paired precision and timely defense ( despite those 116 points from GSW ) on their way to an impressive win . The fact that both teams emerged from this contest still boasting single-digit losses on the season , in the first week of February no less , tells you all you need to know about the potency of these two squads . Atlanta took advantage of a rather whistle-free first half to its benefit to keep up with a footloose-but-at-times-feckless Warriors group before halftime . The Hawks shot just 35 percent in the first quarter , but hung around by playing stellar defense on all manner of penetrating Warriors Golden State was clearly not happy with the series of non-calls as its scorers worked their way to the hoop , but the refereeing crew was at least consistent in its approach . As a result , the Warriors did n t shoot their first free throw until Klay Thompson was fouled on a drive with one-tenth of a second left to go in the first half . It was a 23-10 run spread out over the final minutes of that first half and the first chunks of the second that allowed the Hawks to work their way to a 70-60 lead , a lead sprung with the starters doing battle in the third quarter . The Hawks bench depth , long-questioned and seemingly on edge with swingman Thabo Sefolosha out for a spell , then rose to the occasion to put Golden State away . Brimming with confidence , working mostly off of broken plays or improvisational forays once Golden State s league-leading defense helped chase the ball away from Atlanta s typical scorers , unheralded Hawks reserves managed to score both inside and out with alacrity and gusto . Kent Bazemore , a former Warrior , initially led the charge and finished with 11 points on 3-of-3 3-point shooting . In the second half , reserve forward Mike Scott also nailed all three of his attempts from long range alongside a pair of other slithery makes and a 4-of-4 mark from the line to finish his night with 17 points . Second-year guard Dennis Schroeder , after struggling to run the show in the first half , turned things around as ATL went with a small lineup in the second half ending the contest with nine points and seven assists . Meanwhile , despite those 116 points , the Warriors just could not find a rhythm . Shots from both long and short range spun in and out . Golden State did n t revert to its early season ways with a rash of turnovers , but Atlanta was able to pluck a series of embarrassing backcourt steals on the team s way toward forcing 14 Golden State miscues . Warriors forward Draymond Green demolished his season high with 20 rebounds ( with six assists ) on the night , but he also needed 14 shots to score 12 points and was routinely caught lunging at pump fakes defensively . The Warriors ' MVP candidate , guard Stephen Curry , turned in a fantastic line with 26 points on 8-of-19 shooting with nine assists to just one turnover , adding two steals and two blocks along the way . He also missed seven of his first eight shots , hit one 3-pointer on a lucky bounce and another on an unanticipated bank shot . The production was fine , but it just was n t his night . It s that sort of nitpicking that could possibly belie just how great a contest this was . Atlanta did n t win handily at home , but impressed with its mettle , defensive scheming , plus the unending depth and execution on both ends . Golden State will no doubt shake its head at all the chances gone wrong the lack of communication prior to turnovers , the great looks that spun in and out before moving on to the team s next game on the its mini-road trip . It was n t a classic nail-biter , but it was a performance worthy of two teams that entered the night on pace to win 69 ( Golden State ) and 68 ( Atlanta ) games on the season . The two will match up again in Golden State in mid-March in their final regular-season pairing of 2014-15 , once again away from the national TV cameras and glare of the klieg lights . That s just fine , as us League Pass-types will cherish our little secret . All we could ask for is seven more matchups between the two squads , come June . - - - - - - - Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "It may be early , but with the NFL Draft now in the rearview mirror , it s time for some fantasy football drafting . We recently held a 10-team , 0.5 PPR mock to get things started . The 2018 fantasy football season is officially underway . SEE ROUNDS 1-2 HERE SEE ROUNDS 3-4 HERE SEE ROUNDS 7-8 HERE ROUND 5 Pick 41 : Tevin Coleman , Atl , RB21 The good news is that Coleman stayed healthy in 2017 . The bad news is that he was n t able to overtake Devonta Freeman . Still , his floor is 8 scores . Entering the final year of his rookie deal , maybe he earns a more featured role . ( Liz Loza 2 ) Pick 42 : Alex Collins , Bal , RB22 Ronald Jones is a better pick , but I went with Collins because he s the best of the bunch . After evading more than 5 tackles per game in 2017 , he deserves some respect . ( Loza 1 ) Pick 43 : Alshon Jeffery , Phi , WR18 Jeffery played through a torn rotator cuff all of last season , but he s expected to enter 2018 fully healthy . Durability is a concern , but he s the clear No. 1 WR on an offense that just won the Super Bowl that should score a bunch of points . ( Dalton Del Don 2 ) Pick 44 : Rashaad Penny , Sea , RB23 Seattle will likely immediately treat its first round pick as a workhorse , and while the team struggles run blocking , Russell Wilson s mobility should help , and it s not like it s a poor offensive system . Penny has real talent ( he led college football in broken tackles last year ) and looks like a downright steal at this point in the draft . ( Del Don 1 ) Pick 45 : Ronald Jones , TB , RB24 It s hard not to like Jones landing spot . Before you tell me this is too early for a first-year RB , I ll remind you that three rookies finished among the top-eight fantasy backs last season . ( Andy Behrens 2 ) [ Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues are open : Sign up now for free ] Pick 46 : Brandin Cooks , LAR , WR19 Sure , he might be a boom-or-bust player , but that describes nearly every receiver outside the top tier or two . Cooks wo n t be relegated to the supporting role that Sammy Watkins fell into last season . He and Goff have been working together for over a month . ( Behrens 1 ) Pick 47 : Allen Robinson , Chi , WR20 One of the most treasured offseason acquisitions , the former Jag is fully expected to slide into a lead role for the revamped Bears . It s completely reasonable Robinson attracts 130-plus targets this season . If Mitch Trubisky s game makes significant strides â€¦ 75-1050-7 . ( Brad Evans 2 ) Pick 48 : Royce Freeman , Den , RB25 With only Devontae Booker and De Angelo Henderson to stave off , the rookie has sound odds of becoming Vance Joseph s workhorse . He has the size ( 5-foot-11 , 234 pounds ) , versatility , power and shiftiness ( No. 11 in elusive rating among FBS RBs in 17 ) to stake his claim as the second-best first-year contributor behind Saquon Barkley . ( Evans 1 ) Pick 49 : T.Y. Hilton , Ind , WR21 This pick s upside is tied to Andrew Luck s health , far from a sure thing . But Hilton was still WR24 in standard scoring last year , so he ll get his no matter who plays . ( Scott Pianowski 2 ) Pick 50 : Golden Tate , Det , WR22 Obviously a PPR force , with 90-plus catches in four straight years . ( Pianow 1 ) ROUND 6 Pick 51 : Devin Funchess , Car , WR23 Cam Newton is generally not a kingmaker for his receivers , but Funchess is in line to be the WR1 here , and has the profile of a touchdown scorer . ( Pianow 1 ) Pick 52 : Marvin Jones , Det , WR24 The king of the contested catch , a downfield monster as well averages 17.5 YPC since joining the Lions . Quietly scored nine times last year tied to a plus quarterback in Matthew Stafford . ( Pianow 2 ) Pick 53 : Deshaun Watson , Hou , QB1 Before felled by a knee injury his production over a seven-game stretch reached galactic proportions . Due largely to his duality , he averaged 28.6 fantasy points per game , nearly three full points per game ahead of No. 2 Russell Wilson . Similar to Michael Vick and other multidimensional assets before him , Watson could be the Thanos of passers . ( Evans 1 ) Pick 54 : Aaron Rodgers , GB , QB2 Since 2008 , the decorated QB has finished No. 1 or No. 2 at his position in total fantasy points seven times . He s undoubtedly a true consistency king slated to again challenge for the passer crown . No thrower possesses a higher floor . ( Evans 2 ) Pick 55 : Hunter Henry , LAC , TE4 Henry has found the end-zone 12 times in 25 career games . Antonio Gates is no longer in the team picture , so Henry s outlook improves in a big way . ( Behrens 1 ) Pick 56 : Jimmy Graham , GB , TE5 This guy goes from Brees to Wilson to Rodgers . Must be nice . It s clear that vintage Graham ai n t coming back , but he could easily catch another 8-12 TD passes in Green Bay . ( Behrens 2 ) Pick 57 : Jay Ajayi , Phi , RB26 This is admittedly a bit of a risk , but it sure appears the path to be Philly s main back is cleared for Ajayi , and I want more pieces of this offense . He led the NFL in YPC ( 6.1 ) against light fronts last season . ( Del Don 1 ) Pick 58 : Evan Engram , NYG , TE6 He managed 722 yards and six touchdowns in just 15 games as a rookie in a dismal offense . Engram is clearly a monster in the making and could explode as a sophomore , although Eli Manning limits his upside somewhat . ( Del Don 2 ) Pick 59 : Robert Woods , LAR , WR25 Despite missing four games due to injury , Woods proved to be an ultra-reliable fantasy asset in 2017 . When he was on the field from weeks three through sixteen , the former Bill produced top-thirty fantasy numbers on all but three occasions . His ceiling may not be as high as Brandn Cooks , but his floor is decidedly more firm . ( Loza 1 ) Pick 60 : Tarik Cohen , Chi , RB27 You saw what Nagy did with Tyreek Hill last year , right ? Well I expect the human joystick to get his Q * Bert on under the Bears new regime .

Justin Simien , the film s writer/director who also created the show premiering April 28 , answers that question best in the preview clip above : The movie was sort of written in a time where , honestly , most people , liberal people , conservative people , kinda thought racism was done , Simien says . And the show is coming out in a very different environment , where a lot of people are aware that race is still quite a prevalent issue in our country . The 10-episode Netflix series , in which each installment is told from a different character s point of view , stars Hit the Floor s Logan Browning as Samantha White , the student whose radio show and activism is at the center of both the 2014 movie ( where the character was played by Tessa Thompson ) and the series satirical exploration of race and identity on a prestigious college campus . Empire and Hand of God s Nia Long also stars as an African-American studies professor at Winchester University , while Better Call Saul â€˜ s Giancarlo Esposito is the series narrator . One of the things that was really important to me was that , if you ve seen the movie , I wanted you to feel like you could just slip right into the show , Simien says .

		"paragraph": "Chocolatier Jacques Torres has been famous for his chocolate creations loooong before his turn as a judge on the hit Netflix show Nailed It ! . The French chef produces some of the most sought-after gourmet chocolates in the world , so we had to know his version of an American classic : the chocolate chip cookie . When we interviewed him at one of his New York chocolate shops , he told us he had quite the story behind this recipe . I tried to make French pastries things that are a bit more complicated but when I talked to my customers , the word â€˜ cookies came back a lot . But I m French . I did n t grow up with [ American-style ] cookies . I grew up with shortbread . That did n t stop him from investigating how he could deliver for his customers . I did n t know how to make chocolate chip cookies , so I went to a grocery store not too far from here and I bought the Toll House Morsels . I opened the bag and put all the chocolate in the garbage . It s a true story ! What he wanted , after all , was n t the chocolate : it was the classic recipe for chocolate chip cookies on the back . I took that recipe and translated it into grams and rebalanced it the way I think the recipe should be . Of course , I [ used ] the chocolate I use for bonbons [ because ] it has more cocoa butter , he added . The success of his cookies escalated quickly . We arrived at a point where we could not scoop the cookies fast enough , so we bought a machine that cuts the dough . It now extrudes 80 cookies a minute . We sell thousands every week ! You can buy the world-famous chocolate chip cookies on his website for $ 19 ( for six cookies ) OR you can whip up a homemade batch with the recipe provided . Just do n t forget his tips for what makes his cookies extra-special . Torres says , Baking is simple . What s not simple is to find the best ingredients possible . Luckily , he shared many * key * ingredients below . 1 . Use a Better Butter : Find a butter that has more fat than others . Plugr is Torres go-to and what gets used in his shop . It s a French-style butter that s made in America , so it s much cheaper than the imported kind , and its rich flavor really shines in the cookie . 2 . Get a Good Flour : King Arthur Flour is what Torres swears by . 3 . Age the Dough : We let the dough age for 24 hours so the flavor becomes stronger , Torres tells us . The New York Times explains that this technique of letting the dough rest allows the liquids to fully absorb into the flour , resulting in a cookie with more even caramelization plus richer molasses-y notes . 4 . Invest in the Chocolate : Torres is skeptical of chocolates that do n t melt like chips , for instance . His advice ? Find a high-quality chocolate with lots of cocoa butter , so that the chocolate melts and oozes as it bakes . For this recipe , Torres recommends his baking disks , which are sold online . If you re in a pinch , Valrhona f ves , or oval-shaped chocolate pieces , are at available at Whole Foods . That s what we used for this recipe . Torres also says that what makes his cookie so good is that there s more chocolate than dough , so remember : Pour those disks in liberally ! 5 . Salt It : Though it s optional in the recipe , we re all about going hard on the salty sprinkle on top . It helps accentuate the flavors and balance the sweetness . ( Makes 18 5-inch cookies ) Cook Time : 45 minutes , plus at least 24 hours of chilling Ingredients : Directions : 1 . Sift flours , baking soda , baking powder and salt into a bowl . Set aside . 2 . Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment , cream butter and sugars together until very light , about 5 minutes . 3 . Add eggs , one at a time , mixing well after each addition . Stir in the vanilla . 4 . Reduce speed to low , add dry ingredients and mix until just combined , 5 to 10 seconds . 5 . Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them . 6 . Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours . Dough may be used in batches and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours . 7 . When ready to bake , preheat oven to 350 F . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat . Set aside . 8 . Scoop 6 ( 3 1/2 - ounce ) mounds of dough ( the size of generous golf balls ) onto baking sheet , making sure to turn any chocolate pieces that are poking up back horizontally it will make for a more attractive cookie . 9 . Sprinkle lightly with sea salt ( optional ) . 10 . Bake until golden brown but still soft , 18 to 20 minutes . 11 . Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes , then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more . 12 . Repeat with remaining dough , or reserve dough , refrigerated , for baking remaining batches the next day . Eat warm , with a big napkin . Pin more delectable goodies via Brit + Co s Pinterest page !

		"paragraph": "An Ohio judge has given custody of a transgender teen to his grandparents instead of his parents , who objected to his transition . The new custody arrangement will allow the grandparents to make medical decisions for the teen , KTLA5 reports . The parents of the 17-year-old ( who identifies as male ) did not want him to receive hormone treatments and refused to call him by his chosen name , according to testimony in court , which was triggering suicidal feelings in the young man . Judge Sylvia Sieve Hendon s ruling says that in addition to receiving custody , the grandparents can petition to change the child s name in probate court . The teen will now be covered by the grandparents insurance . The parents wanted to retain custody in order to make medical decisions for the teen and prohibit the treatment that his medical team had recommended . This is an important ruling , because it addresses the searing reality that nearly half 41 percent of trans people attempt suicide at some point in their lives , according to the Trevor Project . Contributing to these attempts are many factors , including feeling victimized , misgendered , and rejected by society , according to study by Rylan Testa , an assistant professor of psychology at Rhodes College . The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey , released by the National Center for Transgender Equality , found that 60 percent of respondents who are out to their immediate family received support from those people about their identity . Still , 10 percent of respondents who had come out to their immediate family experienced violence from a family member because of their identity . The teen has been receiving treatment at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center , who advised the court that he should start treatment as soon as possible to decrease his suicide risk . However , before any hormone treatment is allowed , the court has ordered the teen evaluated by a psychologist who is not affiliated with Cincinnati Children s on the issue of consistency in the child s gender presentation , and feelings of non-conformity . The parents attorney argued that the young man was not even close to being able to make such a life-altering decision at this time . However , Judge Hendon granted visitation rights to the parents , encouraging them to work toward a reintegration of the child into the extended family .

		"paragraph": "The NFL will not be enforcing its anthem policy in the short term , at least . According to a joint statement from the NFL and NFL Players Association ( NFLPA ) released Thursday , no new rules relating to the anthem will be issued or enforced for the next several weeks as the two sides continue to work on coming to an agreement . The statement came just hours after the Associated Press reported that Miami Dolphins players who protest on the field during the national anthem could be suspended for up to four games . The policy , which was issued this week , followed a new rule passed by the NFL in May that bars players from sitting or taking a knee during the national anthem if they are on the field or sidelines . Players can choose to remain in the locker room if they wish not to participate . However , that policy was challenged by the NFLPA earlier this month , which filed a non-injury grievance challenging the policy . The grievance noted that this new policy , imposed by the NFL s governing body without consultation with the NFLPA , is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and infringes on player rights . The NFLPA s challenge to the policy has resulted in discussions between the organization and the NFL in recent weeks , but they have yet to come to a conclusion . The two parties therefore decided to put any new policies on hold while discussions continue , noting that their shared focus will remain on finding a solution to the anthem issue through mutual , good faith commitments , outside of litigation .

		"paragraph": "A Williams syndrome diagnosis afforded my daughter placement in a variety of educational settings . During her high school career , she was placed in special education for mathematics . Some activities have proved themselves very useful while other left me sometimes bewildered and sometimes enraged . Six years ago , in the ninth grade , my daughter s special education teacher thought it would be a great idea to create a coffee shop the students ran . The idea was that students would take orders and deliver coffee to their teachers . Does this scenario sound familiar ? Maybe that s because the Grizzly Bean in Texas went viral . To me , this is free labor and promotion of a stigma that many of us parent advocates strive so hard to diffuse . This fake coffee thing is not employment . Not even close . And it is almost as bothersome to me as special education students wiping down tables in the cafeteria or picking up other people s trash . If it s their choice , great ! Many people choose careers in these clusters , but just as many do not , and would not , if given the chance to choose . Can anyone out there explain to me why the only fields of work that seem to accept workers with disabilities have to do with food and filth ? Why is n t a high school teacher helping students create a career of their choosing ? That s the big question I have . Related : The Emotions You Keep to Yourself When Parenting a Child With a Disability My concern is , if we accept this behavior , applaud it and promote it and continue to praise this lower standard , then we are undercutting an entire population of students that could easily be coached and molded into young professionals . That s exactly where I fear we re going when we give props to the coffee cart . We re modeling training for an order taker not a small business owner . When students are asked to provide services without being compensated for them , we re de-valuing their skill set and ability level instead of growing it . Raise your hand if those are the life lessons and hands-on work-related training you d like for your student to receive in high school ? Personally , I d rather see these students volunteer in the community , or better yet , be included in extracurricular activities with their neurotypical peers . Inclusion , by the way , is not specific students singled out to serve teachers . Inclusion is meaningful , intentional access to contribute to society it is being part of the whole community at large .

		"paragraph": "The nice thing about joining the Five-Timers Club aside from that sweet smoking jacket is the level of comfort you can feel , not just from the host , but from Saturday Night Live itself . It s a welcome respite from the last few months , when the cast and writers have felt pressure to put the Trump administration on blast every week . Related : The SNL Ivanka Trump Ad Was Nauseating But Not for the Reason You Think Of course , they should be mocking politicians and speaking truth to power that s the nature of a weekly topical sketch show . But Scarlett Johansson brings a looseness to this episode that makes even the weak jokes ( looking at you , monologue bit about Kenan s videos ) breezy and forgettable . When s the last time you can remember a host rolling with the punches as easily as ScarJo did when the dog s helmet fell off in Translator or Leslie Jones kept blowing her lines in the ninja sketch ? The real winner is the back half of the show . It used to be a regular thing for the slot at 12:50 a.m. to be high-concept or a weird character piece that flopped as often as it hit . These bits always had a swing for the fences vibe that was endearing , though , and that s been missing lately . This week , the last four sketches all felt like that : bold , silly , and willing to embrace their flaws . Best of the Night : Shud the Mermaid , Shanice Goodwin Ninja-Rivals , A Sketch for the Women , and Funeral Service Kate McKinnon throws herself into ugliness with gleeful abandon . She does n t even need makeup her recurring Sheila Sovage character , the last-call barfly , is arguably the grossest character on the SNL roster but her blobfish mermaid , Shud , does n t let it go to waste . Johansson plays her BFF , Kunk , and their weird Simpsons theme outbursts alone make this sketch worthwhile . Tracy Morgan is not a good actor he never was . But he had a couple of characters that were basically , What if Tracy were an [ occupation you would n t expect Tracy to be ] ? and the results were magical . Brian Fellow was a terrible safari expert and Astronaut Jones was awful in space , but they were both perfect to showcase Morgan . Rivals is n t a great sketch , but by the second or third time out , Shanice Goodwin will be a franchise player . If you ve got a sketch with a message , keep it short . Throw in a couple of good gags like Johansson and Aidy Bryant saying their lines simultaneously , and cramming all the female members of the cast into one table and not letting them talk . Now , if only SNL could cut down on the number of sketches they air that this sketch parodies . Any episode of SNL that does not have a sketch this silly and weird and with this level of commitment should be considered a failure . Likewise , any episode with more than one of these sketches would also be a failure . There are only so many times you can watch the entire cast sing Here is my butt , after all . Worst of the Night : Olive Garden and Zoo Pornographer To be fair , neither of these sketches was bad . Nothing this week was bad . But Olive Garden runs nearly seven minutes , and that s twice as long as a sketch about the cast making funny faces should be . Zoo Pornographer feels like a sketch that s been sitting in a writer s portfolio for years , written more as an exercise than for comedy . Both of these sketches are perfectly acceptable but feel rote . Olive Garden is basic . Finish has an alternate sexual meaning . Episode MVP : Scarlett Johansson So frequently , movie actors can not handle the challenge of live television they re so used to multiple takes and the restraint of film acting that they look like hunks of wood in front of the cameras at Studio 8H . But Johansson earned her smoking jacket and even if she had probably prepared for the eventuality of the dog getting free of the helmet , she handled it like a pro and ad-libbed to cover it like she does this every week .

		"paragraph": "Season 7 of Game of Thrones will see worlds collide , as Daenerys Targaryen arrives in Westeros to stake a claim to the Iron Throne . She ll have to wrest it from Cersei Lannister s cold , scheming fingers , though . And then there are the Starks , who have finally returned to and regained their family seat in Winterfell . Of course , the greatest threat of all is waiting on the other side of the Wall the Night King and his army of White Walkers . As viewers count down the days until the HBO drama s seventh-season premiere on July 16 , Yahoo TV is launching our official countdown : #GoTIsComing . Check back here every day as we give updates on all of your favorite characters , details on an important new location , and a travel guide to the locations of Westeros . So pull on a thick coat and get ready for a long and brutal winter . In the Game of Thrones Season 6 finale , The Winds of Winter , Samwell Tarly ( John Bradley ) and Gilly ( Hannah Murray ) finally concluded their long journey from the Wall via his home , Horn Hill , to Oldtown . There , Sam will study at the Citadel , where he will train to become the maester for the Night s Watch . It was our first glimpse at the venerable institution , which boasts an impressive library and at least one ornery maester-in-residence . So , what do you need to know about this new Game of Thrones location ? The Citadel is part of Oldtown , a city in the southwestern part of Westeros . Oldtown is the oldest city in Westeros , founded by the First Men some 12,000 years ago , and it s the second-largest city after the capital , King s Landing . Oldtown is the seat of the Hightower family , who are loyal to the Tyrells of Highgarden . The Citadel is the headquarters of the Order of Maesters scholars who advise lords of Westeros about medicine , history , science , and other academic matters . They are not religious . The Citadel is managed by a ruling council of archmaesters called the Conclave . Archmaesters determined the seasons like when they sent out the flock of ravens in the Season 6 finale to announce that winter had begun . The Citadel is a university-like complex of buildings , including a massive library . We saw in the finale that it houses an astrolabe ( the spherical thing seen in the opening credits of the show ) . Much like the men of the Night s Watch , aspiring maesters are supposed to give up their family and political allegiances when they enter the Citadel . Younger sons are often sent to the Citadel to train girls and women are strictly forbidden . They begin as acolytes , and when they finish a particular course of study they are given a chain link of a certain metal as a token . Examples are silver for medicine and yellow gold for math and economics . Once an acolyte s chain is full , he becomes a maester and is assigned to a castle or keep . He is expected to be loyal to the place , no matter if there s a change in ownership . In reality , many maesters hold onto old allegiances . Maesters also study the use and care of ravens , their primary form of communication . * Grand Maester Pycelle ( Julian Glover ) served for more than 40 years , but he was secretly loyal to the Lannisters rather than the crown . He was recently murdered by Qyburn , Cersei Lannister s conspirator . * Qyburn ( Anton Lesser ) was a former maester who had been stripped of his chain for human experimentation . He Frankensteined the Mountain back to life . And for his loyal efforts , Qyburn became Cersei s Hand of the Queen and presumably Grand Maester . * Aemon ( Peter Vaughan ) was the maester for the Night s Watch until his death . He was one of only three living Targaryens . * Luwin ( Donald Sumpter ) was the maester at Winterfell until he was stabbed by an Ironborn during the sacking of the castle . In the books , Sam meets an archmaester named Marwyn . Fans are speculating that Jim Broadbent has been cast as Marwyn , though the news said only that he was playing an old professor character . Sam tells Marwyn about his experiences north of the Wall with White Walkers . He already knows that dragonglass and Valyrian steel can kill Walkers . But perhaps he will learn more to help in the fight against the Night King s army . Fans have also posited the theory that Sam learns about R+L = J ( friend Jon Snow s true parentage ) and sends a raven to Jon . That could encourage Jon to reach out to his aunt , Daenerys Targaryen . Game of Thrones Season 7 premieres Sunday , July 16 , at 9 p.m. on HBO . Read more of our #GoTIsComing coverage :",

		"paragraph": "By Mike Stone WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Every time President Donald Trump mentions the $ 110 billion arms deal he negotiated with Saudi Arabia last year , he quickly follows up , saying \" It 's 500,000 jobs . \" But if he means new U.S. defense jobs , an internal document seen by Reuters from Lockheed Martin forecasts fewer than 1,000 positions would be created by the defense contractor , which could potentially deliver around $ 28 billion of goods in the deal . Graphic : U.S. weapons deliveries to Saudi Arabia - https://tmsnrt.rs/2JgvPkq Lockheed instead predicts the deal could create nearly 10,000 new jobs in Saudi Arabia , while keeping up to 18,000 existing U.S. workers busy if the whole package comes together - an outcome experts say is unlikely . A person familiar with Raytheon 's planning said if the Saudi order were executed it could help to sustain about 10,000 U.S. jobs , but the number of new jobs created would be a small percentage of that figure . Lockheed Martin Corp declined to comment on the Saudi package . Raytheon Co 's Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien said last week that hiring overall is growing , but he did not pin it to any particular program . The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment . Jobs are important to Trump . He campaigned on his ability to create American jobs , especially high-paying manufacturing ones . Meanwhile he has limited his criticism of Saudi leadership over the killing of a prominent critic because he did not want to endanger the massive arms deal . Trump 's 500,000 figure has been greeted with widespread skepticism given the five biggest U.S. defense contractors , who make nearly every item on the Saudi list , now employ 383,000 people . Documents seen by Reuters and interviews with defense industry sources familiar with the arms package suggest that between 20,000 and 40,000 current U.S. defense industry workers could be involved in Saudi-bound production if the whole $ 110 billion package goes through . Existing workers typically are experienced , skilled , who can be redeployed more easily than new hires who would require significant upfront investment in their training . One significant caveat to any predictions on job creation is whether all of the missile defenses and radars , ships , tanks , software , bombs and other equipment listed in the full Saudi package get delivered . SAUDI ARABIA JOBS Interviews with people familiar with other major defense contractors ' plans and estimates reflect similar dynamic as Lockheed 's and Raytheon 's plans - relatively minor additions to their U.S. workforce and more significant build-up in Saudi Arabia . Since Trump 's trip to the Kingdom last year , little economic activity has taken place beyond Lockheed 's work on four frigates the Saudis have ordered . The order will yield nearly 10,000 jobs in the Saudi ports for maintenance workers , but only 500 new U.S. jobs will be created , according to documents seen by Reuters . Executives at the several of top U.S. defense companies say Riyadh had wanted much of the military equipment as a way to both develop new domestic industry and to create new jobs and local expertise as a part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's Vision 2030 initiative to wean the country off oil dependency . Saudi Arabia has set a goal of creating 40,000 defense industry jobs by 2030 . The arms package Trump announced in May 2017 came under renewed scrutiny after the Oct. 2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul . The killing provoked international outrage and both the administration and defense contractors have been working to prevent a backlash that could imperil what Trump has called a \" tremendous order \" and 500,000 jobs . Industry executives have argued that without the Saudi package coming through they would have fewer orders to fill , but robust U.S. defense budgets , which account for the majority of their sales , coupled with a record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers would face layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize . Certainly for each defense manufacturing job , other adjacent jobs are supported indirectly by higher demand for defense products . But Heidi Garrett-Peltier , a research fellow at the Political Economy Research Institute , estimated that for this type of industry the highest multiplier would be just below 3.2 . Given that , 20,000 to 40,000 sustained or new jobs could generate between about 64,000 to 128,000 jobs in related industries , Reuters calculations show , bringing the total of sustained and new jobs to between 84,000 and 168,000 . In short , 500,000 jobs Trump keeps bringing up is at least three to five times higher than what one could expect from the Saudi deal , given the estimates from the companies themselves , plus the most generous use of the indirect multiplier . By its own math , the U.S. State Department said in May 2017 that the Saudi deal could support \" tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States . \" ( Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington , Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick Editing by Chris Sanders and Tomasz Janowski )",

		"paragraph": "NEW YORK ( AP ) The scope of Wells Fargo 's fake accounts scandal grew significantly on Thursday , with the bank now saying that 3.5 million accounts were potentially opened without customers ' permission between 2009 and 2016 . That 's up from 2.1 million accounts that the bank had cited in September 2016 , when it acknowledged that employees under pressure to meet aggressive sales targets had opened accounts that customers might not have even been aware existed . People may have had different kinds of accounts in their names , so the number of customers affected may differ from the account total . Wells Fargo said Thursday that about half a million of the newly discovered accounts were missed during the original review , which covered the years 2011 to 2015 . After Wells Fargo acknowledged the fake accounts last year , evidence quickly appeared that the sales practices problems dated back even further . So Wells Fargo hired an outside consulting firm to analyze 165 million retail bank accounts opened between 2009 and 2016 . Related : For more news videos visit Yahoo View , available on iOS and Android . Wells said the firm found that , along with the 2.1 million accounts originally disclosed , 981,000 more accounts were found in the expanded timeline . And roughly 450,000 accounts were found in the original window . The scandal was the biggest in Wells Fargo 's history . It cost then-CEO John Stumpf his job , and the bank 's once-sterling industry reputation was in tatters . The company ended up paying $ 185 million to regulators and settled a class-action suit for $ 142 million . New managers have been trying to amends with customers , politicians and the public . But it 's been tough , as new revelations keep coming . Wells Fargo said last month that roughly 570,000 customers were signed up for and billed for car insurance that they did n't need or necessarily know about . Many could n't afford the extra costs and fell behind in their payments , and in about 20,000 cases , cars were repossessed . Other customers have filed lawsuits against Wells Fargo saying they were victims of unfair overdraft practices . Wells Fargo is also still under several investigations for its sales practices problems , including a congressional inquiry and one by the Justice Department . Wells Fargo said Thursday that of the 3.5 million accounts potentially opened without permission , 190,000 of those incurred fees and charges . That 's up from 130,000 that the bank originally said . Wells Fargo will refund $ 2.8 million to customers , in addition to the $ 3.3 million it already agreed to pay . In addition , San Francisco-based Wells admitted that 528,000 customers were likely signed up for online bill payment without authorization . It 'll refund $ 910,000 in fees to those customers . Since last fall , Wells has changed its sales practices , ousted other executives and called tens of millions of customers to check on whether they truly opened the accounts . \" To rebuild trust and to build a better Wells Fargo , our first priority is to make things right for our customers , and the completion of this expanded third-party analysis is an important milestone , \" Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement .",

		"paragraph": "PHOENIX ( AP ) In a windowless conference room , Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally was asking executives at a small crane manufacturing company how the GOP tax cut has helped their business when one woman said : \" I want to ask you a question about health care . \" Marylea Evans recounted how , decades ago , her husband had been unable to get health insurance after developing cancer , forcing the couple to sell some of their Texas ranch to pay for his treatment . Now she was worried about Democratic ads saying McSally , currently a congresswoman , supported legislation removing the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions . \" It 's a lie , \" McSally said quickly , accustomed to having to interrupt a discussion of the tax cut to parry attacks on health care . But she had voted for a wide-ranging bill that would have , among other things , undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions and drastically changed and shrunk Medicaid . The exchange demonstrated how Democratic arguments about health care are resonating with voters in the final weeks before the midterm elections . While Democratic enthusiasm this year has largely been fueled by anger toward President Donald Trump , candidates have targeted their messaging to focus more on health care . It 's the subject of the greatest share of political ads on television now , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis , and a top issue in campaigns from Virginia to Arkansas to California and especially in Arizona , where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has made it the foundation of her Senate campaign against McSally . \" Democrats believe that health care is the issue that 's going to deliver them the majority , \" said Nathan Gonzalez , editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections . \" In 2016 , Democrats learned that going all-in against Trump was not the right strategy , so they 're trying to be more specific . \" The Democratic furor around health care comes from Trump 's push to repeal the President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act . House Republicans voted for a bill that would have rolled back parts of \" Obamacare . \" But the Senate never took up the bill , and its own attempt to reverse the health care law failed by one vote . This year , the Trump administration supported a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit arguing \" Obamacare \" is unconstitutional . The administration singled out protection for pre-existing conditions as unsustainable . Democrats are effectively performing political judo on the GOP , who accused them over four election cycles of messing up voters ' health care with \" Obamacare \" and vowed a hasty repeal once they were back in power . Now that the GOP tried and failed to change health care , Democrats are pouncing . \" You see in every survey , whether it 's a Senate race in a red state or a House race in a purple district , health care is the No. 1 issue , \" said Patrick McHugh of Priorities USA , a major Democratic campaign group . \" One party wants to actually expand health care coverage and reduce costs , and the other party campaigned claiming they did , but when they got into power , they did not . \" In Missouri , Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat by highlighting that her Republican challenger , state Attorney General Josh Hawley , signed onto the lawsuit over pre-existing conditions . In Michigan , Democrat Elissa Slotkin aired an ad showing her mother dying of cancer and called incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Bishop 's vote for the GOP health bill \" dereliction of duty . \" In Arizona , Democrat Hiral Tipirneni , a physician , is running against Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko after shocking the political world by barely losing an April special election for the seat on a health care platform . Glen Bolger , a Republican pollster , notes that health care is a perennial Democratic base issue but acknowledges it appears especially potent this year . However , he said , Republicans have a possible counter pushing back against some Democrats ' support for a single-payer system that would require higher taxes . \" That , as a pushback message , tests very well , \" Bolger said . Republicans have used it in races where Democratic challengers have backed the policy such as against Katie Porter , an attorney challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in Southern California , or against social worker Kara Eastman , who 's leaned heavily on single payer in her challenge to Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska . The GOP has even levied the charge against Democrats who have n't supported a single-payer program , like Abigail Spanberger , who 's challenging Rep. David Brat in Virginia . Gonzalez said the GOP responses show they 're fighting on Democrats ' turf and keeping the GOP from cashing in politically on the growing economy . \" Democrats believe that health care is the antidote to Republican talk about the economy , \" he said . The Arizona Senate contest provides a microcosm of the issue . Democrats started hitting McSally on health care with an ad barrage from a dark-money group during the GOP primary and have not let up , accusing her of trying to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and charge older people more for health insurance . Sinema mentions the issue everywhere she goes . In an interview with the Spanish-language Univision network Wednesday , she called it \" the centerpiece of my campaign . \" At a recent appearance to rally volunteers in Scottsdale , Sinema was introduced by Leslie Foldy , a 64-year-old court reporter . \" I 've had diabetes since high school . I 've been taking insulin shots ... for the past 47 years , \" Foldy said . Sinema picked up the theme and ran with it . \" We have a chance to elect a United States senator who understands Leslie 's struggles to make sure she gets access to the important medication she needs and that she 's not discriminated against because of having a pre-existing health condition , \" she said . It was a dig at the GOP health bill that McSally supported for containing what she calls an \" age tax \" a provision allowing insurance companies to charge people ages 50 to 64 who buy insurance on health exchanges rates five times higher than younger consumers . Under the ACA , the limit is three times higher . In an interview , Sinema described her health care agenda as mainly a fight to preserve popular parts of \" Obamacare . \" She said she did n't like everything about the bill and noted she 'd sponsored bills delaying or repealing some of its funding mechanisms taxes on medical devices and health insurance . McSally instead focuses on the shortcomings of the law , blaming it for driving up health premiums for small businesses and other consumers and arguing Republicans are just trying to make things better . She bristles at the \" age tax \" attacks because she wrote an amendment adding $ 90 billion in subsidies for older consumers to protect against higher insurance rates . Although the GOP health bill did contain provisions that weakened the ACA 's protections of pre-existing conditions , McSally calls pre-existing conditions \" a line in the sand \" that she 'll protect . \" We 've all got people in our lives who struggle with chronic disease , \" McSally said . \" It 's personal for all of us . The Democrats are taking this line of attack because they know health care is personal . \"",

		"paragraph": "By Christopher Johnson LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent to a four-year high on Monday after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply . Benchmark Brent crude hit its highest since November 2014 at $ 80.94 per barrel , up $ 2.14 or 2.7 percent , before easing to around $ 80.65 by 1335 GMT . U.S. light crude was $ 1.30 higher at $ 72.08 . \" This is the oil market 's response to the OPEC + group 's refusal to step up its oil production , \" said Carsten Fritsch , commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt . OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group , Russia , on Sunday effectively rebuffed a demand from Trump for moves to cool the market . \" I do not influence prices , \" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters as OPEC and non-OPEC energy ministers gathered in Algiers for a meeting that ended with no formal recommendation for any additional supply boost . Trump said last week that OPEC \" must get prices down now ! \" , but Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday OPEC had not responded positively to Trump 's demands . \" It is now increasingly evident , that in the face of producers reluctant to raise output , the market will be confronted with supply gaps in the next three-six months that it will need to resolve through higher oil prices , \" BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told Reuters Global Oil Forum . Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria said on Monday that Brent could rise to $ 90 per barrel by Christmas and pass $ 100 in early 2019 , as markets tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran are fully implemented from November . JPMorgan said U.S. sanctions on Iran could lead to a loss of 1.5 million barrels per day , while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market . The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as top producer Russia has been discussing raising output to counter falling supply from Iran , although no decision has been made public yet . A source familiar with OPEC discussions told Reuters on Friday that OPEC and other producers have been discussing the possibility of raising output by 500,000 bpd . \" We expect that those OPEC countries with available spare capacity , led by Saudi Arabia , will increase output but not completely offset the drop in Iranian barrels , \" said Edward Bell , commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank . U.S. commercial crude oil inventories are at their lowest since early 2015 and although U.S. oil production is near a record high of 11 million bpd , subdued U.S. drilling points toward a slowdown in output .

And , yes , the mom of Leo s new lady is younger than he is . ) In an effort not to attract too much attention during their kiss sessions , we guess , the Oscar winner wore a disguise to ward off photogs and camera-happy attendees . But Leo seems to have put little thought into it . It was more like : Let me grab these 3-D glasses I wore to the movies the other day to pair with this bland hoodie . However , the fact that he was dripping with pretty ladies gave him away . Leo is so talented that we do n t feel bad calling him out for being awful at real-life disguises . We ll just direct you to last year s Coachella look , which was also halfhearted â€¦ like we would n t know there were two hunky leading men hi , Orlando Bloom under those hooded tops . In 2016 , he covered more of his face , but his famous girlfriend , Toni Garrn , did n t so â€¦ Leo has attempted disguises simple and extreme like this mask he wore sightseeing in Venice . Not surprisingly , photogs knew this was him . Most often though , he hides beneath a simple hat . That s probably why he always wears one it s an easy pap deterrent . Well , in theory . Is it really a deterrent if we can still mostly see him ? He has also been known to use a shirt though also not that effectively .

But honestly , walking down a New York City street carrying a golf umbrella is n t a good cover . Everyone is looking at you to shoot daggers your way for taking up the whole sidewalk . He really went for it here with this hat , umbrella , and hands triple combo . But even getting assistance from a second party did n t help . We see you , Leo . We always see you .

		"paragraph": "The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would pay up to $ 12bn ( 9bn ) to help US farmers weather a growing trade battle with China , the European Union and others , in a clear signal the president is determined to stick with tariffs as his weapon of choice in the conflict . The move to cushion the blow for a politically important constituency rural and agricultural states that supported US President Donald Trump by wide margins in the election but have been targeted by China 's retaliation to his trade tactics was met with broad criticism by many farmers and farm-belt lawmakers . Mr Trump 's trade policies have become central in several rural-state US Senate races ahead of congressional elections in November , as Democrats there try to keep hold of several seats that Republicans have targeted . The president , speaking at an event in Kansas City on Tuesday , aggressively reaffirmed his support for tariffs and pledged that ultimately , \" farmers will be the biggest beneficiary . \" \" Just be a little patient , \" Mr Trump said . US bosses warn on trade war dangers as Trump s tariffs bite To that end , the relief package is intended to serve as only a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate over trade issues , officials said . \" This obviously is a short-term solution that will give President Trump time to work on a long-term trade policy , \" said Sonny Perdue , the secretary of the US Department of Agriculture . The aid will be financed through the USDA 's Commodity Credit Corporation and thus will not require congressional approval , Mr Perdue said . The CCC has broad authority to make loans and direct payments to US growers when prices for corn , soybeans , wheat and other agricultural goods are low . The administration 's action appeared to divide Republicans . Kevin Cramer , a US representative trying to unseat Democrat senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota , praised the move . \" Great to see providing aid to farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs , \" he wrote on Twitter . But other Republicans were troubled by what they view as the kind of widespread government-assistance program their party has traditionally opposed . \" This trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and the White House 's ' plan ' is to spend $ 12bn on gold crutches , \" said Senator Ben Sasse , a Nebraska Republican who frequently criticises the president . Why Trump 's trade war with the EU and China could end in disaster \" Tariffs are taxes that punish American consumers and producers , \" Kentucky Republican senator Rand Paul wrote on Twitter . \" If tariffs punish farmers , the answer is not welfare for farmers the answer is remove the tariffs . \" Democratic Representative Jackie Speier of California , a major agricultural state , on Twitter accused Trump of trying to \" placate the farmers that voted for you \" with a $ 12bn payment . Later this week , Mr Trump will visit Iowa and Illinois , two other farm-belt states , as he seeks to shore up support for Republican candidates in those regions . Farmers have been a particular target in the current clash over trade policy as other countries seek to retaliate for Mr Trump 's duties on Chinese goods as well as on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union , Canada and Mexico . Those affected economies have in turn targeted US agricultural products , including soybeans , dairy , meat , produce and liquor . The United States exported $ 138bn in agriculture products in 2017 , including $ 21.5 bn of soybeans , the most valuable export . China alone imported $ 12.3 bn of US soybeans last year , according to the USDA . How soybeans sow discontent in trade war The size of the direct payments to farmers as a result of trade shortfalls would be unprecedented , said Scott Irwin , an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois . \" We have never compensated farmers directly on such a large scale for retaliatory tariffs , \" Mr Irwin said . The news lifted shares of farm equipment companies on the prospect that farmers will have more money to spend on tractors and other farm gear . Deere & Co jumped 3.1 pc , while Caterpillar gained more than 1pc and AGCO Corp rose 0.6 pc . Soybean futures , hit hard by China 's retaliatory tariffs , rose 1.2 pc and hit their highest in two weeks as traders bet farm aid would improve demand , reducing a current surplus supply . Still , Blake Hurst , a corn and soybean farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau , said that unless the White House 's policies change , the US agriculture industry will continue to suffer . The payments will be helpful to farmers facing overdue loans and angry bankers , but are completely insufficient if they mean that tariffs and the trade war will last for the foreseeable future , \" Mr Hurst said . \" They are a very temporary bandage to a self-inflicted wound .

		"paragraph": "EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. ( AP ) -- Von Miller simply could n't believe this was the Denver Broncos ' defense . Neither could Chris Harris Jr. , Shane Ray or anyone else on that side of the ball . A 34-16 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday in which they allowed 512 yards - including a whopping 323 on the ground - had the Broncos wondering what went wrong . '' We 're usually a pretty stout defense , '' Miller said . '' Today , we were n't . We got gashed over the top two or three times today . Yeah , it was a rough one . '' Denver came in with the 17th overall defense , but was eighth against the run . Watching Isaiah Crowell scamper all over the field for a Jets-record 219 yards on 15 carries was stunning . '' We start fast , but we ca n't maintain it , '' Harris said . '' They ran the ball great today and we gave up too many big plays in the passing game . We ca n't allow a team to run the ball like that . That 's not our standard . '' No , this definitely is n't the Orange Crush . These Broncos were simply crushed . '' Too many big plays , '' Harris said . '' We have to rally the troops and start from square one . We have to figure out who wants to be here and who wants to change this . I 'm all in . I want to win . '' Denver has now lost three straight and was coming off a defeat to Kansas City in which the Broncos blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead . '' It 's very frustrating , '' Ray said . '' We 're trying to be the best team that we can possibly be . And today , we did n't put it all together . We did n't put it together well at all . I do n't know what it is team-wise or what 's going on . This is not who we are . '' This is n't even the team we were last week . '' In this one , the Jets turned the ball over on their second play from scrimmage when Adam Gotsis knocked the ball out of Bilal Powell 's hands and recovered at New York 's 20 . Three plays later , Case Keenum found Courtland Sutton in the end zone from 8 yards out to give Denver a 7-0 lead . The Broncos kept the Jets off the scoreboard in the first quarter , but then New York took advantage of an ugly 20-yard punt early in the second by Colby Wadman , who replaced the injured Marquette King . Crowell took the handoff , scooted to the left sideline and zipped into the end zone for a 77-yard touchdown . On New York 's next possession , Sam Darnold found Robby Anderson streaking down the field uncovered and connected for a 76-yard TD that put New York ahead 14-7 with 10:46 left in the half . '' Anyone who saw the game knows it was n't good enough , '' safety Justin Simmons said . '' It 's not what we do . We 've got to be better . It was n't anything we were n't expecting . We were undisciplined . We were n't gap sound in the run game . Credit to them for making the plays , but it was n't anything that had us rattled . We just did n't make the plays that we had to . '' And this was against a Jets offense that had struggled mightily the last few weeks . They had only 178 total yards in a 31-12 loss at Jacksonville last Sunday , including just 34 on the ground . '' It 's one of those moments where you really ca n't put words to it , '' Ray said , '' because , obviously , I felt like this is a team we should beat - no disrespect to them . '' The Jets ' offensive line not only opened holes all day for the running game , but it kept Darnold 's jersey mostly clean . Denver had just one sack , shared by Derek Wolfe and Domata Peko , and Miller had his third straight game without taking down a quarterback . '' I feel like we 've been close all season , but they do n't keep track of being close , '' Miller said . '' They keep track of stats - turnovers , sacks - and I just have n't been worth anything the last couple of weeks . '' While the Broncos were clearly angry about the loss , coach Vance Joseph insisted the locker room will be OK - and the team will be able to turn it around quickly . '' It 's not going to be difficult , guys , '' Joseph said . '' We 're not going to fall for the noise . We came into this game on a short week after an emotional loss on Monday . We ca n't surrender to this . That 's what the public thinks . That 's what the perceptions are . We have no excuses today . We did n't play good and it showed up . '' That team wanted it more than our football team today . '' Next up for the Broncos are the high-scoring Los Angeles Rams , who will present another test for a defense that is looking for a rebound . '' I 'm ready , '' Harris said . '' I do n't care who we play . Whoever I have to guard , line them up . I 'm ready to do my thing . '' --- More AP NFL : https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP-NFL",

		"paragraph": "By Aishwarya Venugopal ( Reuters ) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc ( CMG.N ) topped Wall Street profit estimates on Thursday , as newer menu items and a marketing blitz helped the burrito chain recover from a series of food-safety lapses that had kept diners away . Chipotle shares , up over 40 percent this year thanks to optimism around new CEO Brian Niccol 's plan to improve the company 's image , rose nearly 2 percent in extended trading . Niccol has brought back popular items like chorizo and introduced a long-awaited loyalty program , limited-time items and food-delivery through a dedicated smartphone app as well as DoorDash . \" We are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers , \" Niccol said of Chipotle 's mobile app , speaking to analysts on a conference call . Sales through digital channels surged 48 percent in the quarter ended September , Chipotle said . The company has also overhauled its marketing with increased use of social media channels and an ad campaign that draws attention to its use of \" real \" ingredients , aimed at health-conscious diners . \" Marketing did have an impact as we went on air and as customers start to see the commercials ... we did see an improvement in our sales , \" Niccol said . The once-popular burrito chain 's sales and shares are yet to fully recover since its restaurants were linked to E. coli and salmonella outbreaks in 2015 that sickened hundreds of people . A new spate of food safety issues this July had added to Chipotle 's headaches . However , the latest health-related incident at a single outlet that caused nearly 700 people to fall sick , did not have a lasting impact on sales , Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said on the conference call . Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months rose 4.4 percent in the third quarter , helped by price hikes , but fell short of Wall Street expectations of a 5.02 percent increase , according to Refinitiv data . \" The miss ( was ) widely known and expected , \" Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said , adding that Chipotle was seeing some early success with its turnaround . Net income roughly doubled year-over-year to $ 38.2 million , while restaurant-level operating margin climbed to 18.7 percent from 16.1 percent , as Chipotle kept expenses in check . Excluding one-time items , Chipotle earned $ 2.16 per share , topping estimates of $ 2 per share . Revenue rose nearly 9 percent to $ 1.23 billion , matching expectations .

		"paragraph": "China is to launch a fake \" moon \" into space that it hopes will illuminate one of the country 's biggest cities . Officials in Chengdu , a city of 14 million people in China 's southwestern province of Sichuan , announced plans to place a satellite in orbit by 2020 capable of reflecting sunlight onto its streets at night , claiming it will be bright enough to entirely replace street lights . The satellite would use a reflective coating to direct light to illuminate an area on earth of up to 50 square miles , according to Wu Chunfeng , chairman of the city s Aerospace Science and Technology Microelectronics System Research Institute . The launch follows a similar project in 1999 when Russian researchers planned to use orbiting mirrors to light up cities in Siberia , hoping it would be a cheaper alternative to electric lighting . The scheme developed by Russia used a device called Znamya 2 . It was equipped with a 25-metre mirror to illuminate a three-mile wide patch of land . During its first orbit the craft was destroyed following a collision in space . The scheme was abandoned . In remarks first reported by CIFNews , Mr Chunfeng told a science event in Chengdu that the artificial moon , which has been undergoing testing for several years , will produce at least eight times more light than the real moon . He did not say how much the project would cost . Scientists have warned the device could disturb wildlife and disrupt systems that observe the earth s atmosphere . However , Kang Weimin , a director at the School of Aerospace at the Harbin Institute of Technology , told CIFNews that the satellite will produce a dusk-like glow , meaning it will not affect animals .",

With less than a month to go until this summer s tournament , it s time to get familiar with each of the 32 teams participating in Russia . Next up in Group G is England . For more analysis , lineup projections and predictions , head to our World Cup preview hub , bookmark it , and return as all 32 team previews and eight group previews roll in . Odds to win Group G : 46.5 % Odds to advance : 85.7 % Odds to win World Cup : 5.9 % Elo rank : 7 Yahoo Sports power rank : 10 Our writers say : Say what you like about England , but the Three Lions follow an incredibly consistent pattern : qualify with a near-perfect record , capitulate under the unbearable pressure created by media hype , quietly exit the tournament in underwhelming fashion . Wash , rinse and repeat . With Gareth Southgate s successful back-three experimentation , surprising depth in midfield and the prolific Harry Kane leading the line , there s always the chance England will relive the magic of 1966 and go all the way . But there s a better chance of going out at the Round of 16 to Colombia on penalties . Ryan Bailey ( Odds via BetOnline , converted to percentages and therefore slightly exaggerated ) World Cup appearance : 14th Best World Cup finish : Champion ( 1966 ) 2014 finish : Group stage ( 0-1-2 ) Qualifying : Topped UEFA Group F ahead of Slovakia , Scotland , Slovenia Schedule : Tunisia ( Monday , June 18 , 2 p.m. , FS1 ) , Panama ( Sunday , June 24 , 8 a.m. , FS1 ) , Belgium ( Thursday , June 28 , 2 p.m. , Fox/FS1 ) Manager : Gareth Southgate Captain : Harry Kane ( F ) Top players : Raheem Sterling ( F ) , Kane , Kyle Walker ( D ) Full 23-man squad Why they ll win games : Because they have a system , and players who make it function . In other words , they have a plan , and players who can execute it . You have n t been able to say that very often about England teams . This one is different . It s youthful and sans egos . It s one of the most athletically impressive in Russia . Sterling and Kane accentuate each other s strengths up top . And the defense , as of May , has n t conceded from open play in 627 minutes of soccer against the likes of Brazil , Germany , Italy and the Netherlands . Why they ll lose games : England s best player is also its biggest worry : Kane has n t been himself since rushing back from an ankle injury in March . It s difficult to overstate just how far off the pace he s been . There s virtually no chance Southgate turns away from him and to Marcus Rashford or Jamie Vardy , but his presence could be problematic if a few weeks of rest do n t do him any good . Elsewhere , there s one massive question mark in net . Despite the strong defensive record , there s not a single center back who has been playing consistently and at a high level for his club . And Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain s injury is a significant blow . Oh , and there s still the question of how the Three Lions will break down lesser foes . They have n t piloted the new tactical setup against a team like Panama or Tunisia . How they ll play : It s already as distinct and defined a system as any in Russia , which is remarkable given its freshness . In a way , it s an amalgamation of the systems many of England s players are accustomed to at their respective clubs . It ll be a 3-5-2 , with one No. 6 and dual 8s in midfield . The 6 Jordan Henderson or Eric Dier holds and dictates . The 8s likely Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli run a lot , act as attack-minded shuttlers , support the strikers and spur counters . Projected lineup ( 3-5-2 ) : Jordan Pickford Kyle Walker , Eric Dier , John Stones Kieran Trippier , Jesse Lingard , Jordan Henderson , Dele Alli , Danny Rose Raheem Sterling , Harry Kane . Jack Butland and Nick Pope are the other two keepers none of the three inspire supreme confidence . Southgate has tried Kyle Walker as his right-sided center back , and given the call-ups for Trippier and Trent Alexander-Arnold , it appears he ll stick with that plan . He has n t yet tried Dier at center back from the start , but that would seem to be his best option to maximize the overall talent in the 11 . Other possible starters are Phil Jones and Harry Maguire ( center back ) Ashley Young ( wing back ) and maybe even Ruben Loftus-Cheek ( central midfield ) . Rashford will likely have to settle for a place on the bench , unless Southgate reconfigures to a 3-4-3 . What makes them unique : This : Why to root for them : That . And also the message that it represents . This is a team of young , diverse , hungry kids soaked in expectations . They re exuberant . They re fun . And yet they re still going to get crushed and vilified if they lose . Why to root against them : Because you d take guilty pleasure in the s storm that would ensue if/when they crash out . What else makes them unique : This England team was n t supposed to happen . It was supposed to be Sam Allardyce s yes , that Big Sam , one of the most curmudgeonly figures in football . But after one game , he was sacked following an undercover Telegraph investigation that caught Allardyce explaining how to circumvent FIFA rules to accept illicit payments . Southgate got the job on an interim basis , then on a permanent basis . And England , looking back on the scandal , is probably incredibly thankful it happened . If you re going to watch one game â€¦ The obvious answer is the Belgium game . But there s a chance it s meaningless , especially with no clear favorite in Group H . So take the risk on that , or choose the opener . ( Or , ya know , just watch both . ) Group A : Russia | Saudi Arabia | Egypt | Uruguay Group B : Portugal | Spain | Morocco | Iran Group C : France | Australia | Peru | Denmark Group D : Argentina | Iceland | Croatia | Nigeria Group E : Brazil | Switzerland | Costa Rica | Serbia Group F : Germany | Mexico | Sweden | South Korea Group G : Belgium | Panama | Tunisia | England Group H : Poland | Senegal | Colombia | Japan Henry Bushnell covers global soccer for Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "Medal count | Olympic schedule | Olympic news RIO DE JANEIRO He does n t have to retire , you know . The only person making Michael Phelps hang it up is Michael Phelps . And Michael Phelps has been known to change his mind . He insists he s done . Has said that steadfastly . And this time , unlike the last two times he retired , there is something meaningful for him to do outside the pool namely raise his infant son , Boomer . I just do n t see it happening , said his forever coach , Bob Bowman . He s in such a good place personally . And it s time other people need to step up . ( That last thought was the voice of the U.S. men s Olympic team . Not necessarily the voice of Phelps coach . Bowman is both of those things . ) He probably will retire and stay retired this time . But it s purely his choice , not a matter of being too old to compete . The rest of the best in the world ca n t chase him out of the pool . Even as an aquatic geriatric , Phelps remains the greatest male swimmer on the planet by a laughably large margin . This clearly is n t Peyton Manning at the end , trying to get by on wits and guile and his defensive teammates . It is n t Michael Jordan stubbornly trying to rekindle lost magic with the Washington Wizards . It s a guy who is swimming like this is Beijing all over again . He was the world s best in 2004 . And 2008 . And even in 2012 , while faking it . And as crazy as it is to comprehend , he s still the best in 2016 . He has four gold medals in this Rio Revival to prove his dominance . With two more possibly on the way . Phelps is so far superior that he absolutely beat down the field in the 200-meter individual medley Thursday night . He crushed six men who have recorded world Top 10 times in 2016 . This was a quality field , and he decimated it . Phelps toyed with the second-best male swimmer of the 21st century , Ryan Lochte . He left 400 IM champion Kosuke Hagino flailing in futile pursuit and finishing nearly a full two seconds behind Phelps to claim silver . He dismissed the fevered challenge of national hero Thiago Pereira , the best the Brazilians have to offer in the water , who inspired raucous cheers before the race from the home fans . Fully energized , Pereira shot out to the lead after the butterfly leg . Lochte nudged barely ahead at the halfway point , after the backstroke . But Phelps was right there with them , and only one man would survive the stout early pace . Lochte cracked , faded and finished fifth . Pereira withered even more dramatically , finishing seventh . Hagino of Japan and Wang Shun of China , never in contention when it mattered , picked up the pieces of the disintegrating race to grab medals , far in arrears of the GOAT . It was flat silly . The most impressive part of the race was Phelps breaking everyone s will on the breaststroke leg . It s his worst stroke . I think he surprised them a little bit , Bowman said . Afterward , Phelps surprised his coach a little bit by tearing up on the medal stand . The emotion is understandable during this farewell meet , but the timing made it remarkable . Phelps had to swim a 100 butterfly semifinal just minutes after they hung the medal around his neck . And yet there he was with his chin quivering and eyes welling up , as if it were his first gold medal and not his twenty-freaking-second . That s the first time he s done that , Bowman said . I ve always told him [ when he has another event to swim after a medal ceremony ] , â€˜ Build the fire up in you during the national anthem . He s like a machine , usually . But I liked to see it . Here s why it was great to see : it s further proof that Phelps is living in this very special moment . Phelps did his time in recovery after his second DUI in 2014 , and that s a key tenet of most recovery programs stay present and be honest with your emotions . Phelps let his emotions be shown Thursday night . Even with scant time to spare , he was fully present on that podium not stressing about the 100 fly to come , but soaking in something that quite frankly seems to have awed even the man making it happen . When this last comeback began , Phelps was so far from this kind of performance . He weighed more than he ever had , and his conditioning had evaporated . The process of pushing himself hard enough to regain near-peak form is what has made this a very , very special week so far , he said . It was n t going to be an easy process and I had to force myself through the pain I really did n t want to feel , he said . But â€¦ I had to do it . Before , I was always looking for shortcuts . â€˜ Maybe I can skip a week here or there and still get by . Or , â€˜ I can skip that butterfly set . I kind of went through some obstacles I had n t before , but I had to do it . He put in the work . Simple as that . It took more work than ever before , because things do n t come as easy at 30 as they did at 20 , but he did it . The rewards are in the beatings he is now administering . Phelps slapped down South African Chad Le Clos earlier this week in the 200 butterfly to reclaim the title he d lost to him in London four years ago . Thursday he reasserted his mastery of Lochte , in the meantime becoming the first Olympic swimmer ever to win the same event four straight times . And that butterfly leg he had to turn around and swim just more than 30 minutes after the IM ? That was fine , too . He s qualified for the finals , and not a single living being is picking against him . Still , it is n t easy pushing his 31-year-old body through a double like that . Phelps exited the pool after that semi like Jim Brown getting up after being tackled . Slowly , gingerly like he may never be right again . Brown would return to the huddle and then trample everyone on the next play . Phelps will return to the pool Friday and likely do the same . It may be a little bit harder [ to get out of the pool ] , the GOAT said . It may take a little longer . But it s just as sweet standing on top of the podium hearing the national anthem play .

		"paragraph": "The Oklahoma City Thunder holding a late lead over the San Antonio Spurs in the closing seconds of a playoff game at AT&T Center . Dion Waiters inbounding . Manu Ginobili defending . What could possibly go wrong ? [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] Well , as it turned out , not quite as much as went wrong in Game 2 ... but from the perspective of the Spurs and their fans watching Tuesday 's Game 5 with bated breath , still too much . After Tony Parker missed a jumper that would 've put San Antonio back on top , the Thunder had the ball with a 92-91 lead and 9.3 seconds remaining . This time , the inbounds itself was n't the issue , as Waiters was able to cleanly pass the ball to cutting teammate Russell Westbrook . After Westbrook caught the ball , though ... that 's where it got interesting . Spurs star Kawhi Leonard lunged to foul Westbrook , hoping to stop the clock , extend the game , send the All-Star point guard to the foul line , and get San Antonio the ball back with a chance to either tie or , depending on how Russell shot at the stripe , maybe even win it . But despite Leonard appearing to pretty clearly wrap Westbrook up around the waist after the catch , no whistles blew . The Spurs seemed to relax , expecting the play to be stopped and wondering why it had n't been . Westbrook , ever the hard-charging opportunist , simply continued his curl to the cup , where he twirled in a layup around a half-hearted contest by San Antonio big man LaMarcus Aldridge . He was called for a foul on the shot , sending Russ to the line with a chance for a 3-point play he converted the and-one , giving OKC a 95-91 lead that would hold up for the final 6.3 seconds , sending the Thunder back home with a chance to eliminate the Spurs at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Thursday . As you might expect especially considering all the attention given the insane finish to , and officiating post-mortem of , Game 2 the Hoped-For Foul That Was n't was a popular topic of conversation after the game . Westbrook : \" I just keep going until the whistle blows . My job is to stay in attack mode , and then , when they did n't blow the whistle , my job is to keep going to the basket . \" Leonard : \" I definitely fouled him . But the referee , I guess , he did n't see it , and you know , you 've just got to keep playing through it . \" Danny Green : \" At the end of the game , we were obviously looking to get a steal , and if not , I think we tried to put it in the referee 's mind I do n't know if they spoke to him or not , but we tell them either [ we want a ] timeout if they get a score , or [ we 're going to ] foul , so that they 're looking for it . I do n't know if they spoke to the referees or not , but we were looking to get a steal or a foul , and I think when Manu and Kawhi had him in the corner , it looked like from my angle that they wrapped him up . But I 'm not sure . I do n't know what he 'd seen on the baseline . That 's his job , not mine , to decide whether or not it was a foul . Obviously , he did n't see one . \" It is safe to say that Green 's a bit more of a talker than either Kawhi or Gregg Popovich , who was characteristically terse in his post-Game 5 comments . \" He fouled him , \" Pop said . \" It was pretty obvious he fouled him . But , you know , every call does n't get called . That 's the way the game is . I was more concerned about the play before that , with Durant 's shot . \" Oh , right : that . With just under a minute remaining in the fourth and the score tied at 90 , Green who has done yeoman 's work on the defensive end all season long , and has had his hands full trying to slow down whichever of OKC 's monster scoring wings he 's drawn throughout this series tried to stay attached to Kevin Durant on the baseline . Durant stepped into the paint , and then jetted back to his left to cut toward the ball , which Westbrook was dribbling up top . Green reacted , leaned to his right , and found himself colliding with bruising Thunder screen-setter Steven Adams . As he turned around Adams , though , Green lost his footing and tumbled into Durant 's legs in the act of shooting , causing a whistle that sent KD to the line for two free throws he 'd make them both , putting OKC up by two with 54.7 seconds left . As soon as the whistle blew , Green was clearly livid , pleading his case to whichever official was within earshot . Teammate Tim Duncan did the same , indicating that Adams might have gone a bit above and beyond in setting the screen to send Green skidding into Durant 's legs . The replays confirmed that there was indeed some additional action on the back end of the screen , with Adams stepping his left leg way back and into the path Green was trying to travel to close down the distance on Durant : This play , too , was a topic of conversation after the game , with Green asked if he believed Adams stuck that big left leg out on purpose . \" Is that a trick question ? \" he replied with a smile . \" I do n't know if it was intentional . I did n't see the replay clear enough . I just know that he does a good job of setting screens for them . Sometimes the refs see . Sometimes they do n't . You know , he gives a little extra , but that 's what he 's supposed to do , and on that particular play , he did a good job of clearing out [ ... ] and I tried to chase KD around the screen . \" My leg came out from under me . I 'm pretty sure it was his foot . I do n't know if it was intentional or not , but the reason why I fouled Durant was the domino effect of being tripped . \" Having what appeared to be two incorrect calls go against them in the final 60 seconds of a critical Game 5 in a tied series against a really good opponent is , well , not what the Spurs and their fans are looking for . But , as ever , it 's typically a drastic oversimplification to chalk up success or failure to one or two whistles that go one way or the other . Spurs fans pointing fingers at the zebras would do well to save some for Aldridge 's 6-for-21 shooting performance . Or for the inability to finish defensive possessions , resulting in OKC pulling down 15 offensive rebounds , including four big ones in the fourth quarter , as the combination of size ( Adams and Enes Kanter again made their presence felt ) and aggression ( Westbrook was out there grabbing rebounds over the top of David West 's head ) simply overwhelmed San Antonio 's more groundbound interior players . Or for Popovich 's decision to roll with an all-bench lineup West , Patty Mills , Boris Diaw , Manu Ginobili , Kyle Anderson that OKC outscored by eight points in five minutes of floor time at the ends of the first and third quarters , helping erase what had been a 12-point lead midway through the third and get the Thunder within one possession heading into the fourth . Or for Parker missing both a free throw and a pull-up jumper in the final minute that could have given San Antonio a tie or a lead . It 's tempting to lay this at the feet of the officials it always is but any of a number of plays through the first 47 minutes , 50 seconds of game time could have given the Spurs the cushion they needed to hold fast late . But hey , do n't take my word for it . Ask the Spurs . \" It 's difficult , but we 've just got to play through it , \" Leonard said . \" Unfortunately , every call does n't get called throughout the whole game , and we needed that one , but we 've just got to keep rolling . \" \" We were frustrated , obviously , \" Green said . \" We wanted the foul . But you 've got to continue to play basketball , and Russ made a big play , got an and-one , put them up four . \" \" Sometimes you get a call , sometimes you do n't , \" Popovich said . \" It happens to everybody . Tough game . \" And that means San Antonio 's in for another tough game one that , over the years , has n't been particularly friendly to Coach Pop : Whatever Wednesday 's last two minutes report turns up , it wo n't change the predicament in which the Spurs now find themselves : facing elimination on the road , and needing to put together their best performance in two weeks to stay alive long enough to hope home-court advantage can be the difference-maker in Game 7 that it was n't in Games 2 and 5 . Those two final-minute plays might not have changed that , either . That wo n't make them sting any less to Spurs fans , though , especially if OKC finishes the job on Thursday .

		"paragraph": "From Cosmopolitan Shortly after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school , Donald Trump tweeted that , if the attack \" was as bad as she says , \" Ford would 've reported it . In an effort to point out the obvious-people do n't report for a multitude of reasons , not least of which a disbelief that anything will happen after they go through the rigorous , traumatizing process-people flooded the internet with their own stories of why they did n't report prior assaults . Over the weekend , a second woman named Deborah Ramirez came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh . Both women have been horribly harassed-by strangers online and by members of the GOP-since going public with the allegations . Now , to show support for Dr. Ford and Ramirez , and to protest the confirmation of Kavanaugh , a national #BelieveSurvivors walkout is scheduled for Monday . Here 's everything you need to know . Starting at 1 p.m. EST ( 10 a.m. PST ) on Monday , Sept. 24 , people will walk out of their offices , classrooms , homes , et cetera . People in Washington D.C. plan to meet in a Senate building at 12:30 to walk to the Supreme Court for a National Speakout . According to the Facebook event page , participants are encouraged to share a photo of themselves walking out to social media with the hashtag #BelieveSurvivors . The goal is to show Senate Republicans , who have been negotiating with Dr. Ford about when and if she 'll be able to testify about Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing , that Americans believe Dr. Ford , Ramirez , and all survivors of assault . Whether you 're able to walk out or not , you can also show support for Kavanaugh 's accusers and survivors of assault by wearing black-the official protest color . Dozens of organizations-including the Me Too Movement , Women 's March , and Planned Parenthood Action-are listed as co-hosts on the walkout event page . And dozens of leaders and celebrities have announced they 'll be joining the walkout online . Both Tarana Burke , the founder of the Me Too movement , and Alyssa Milano , who reignited the movement in late 2017 , say they 'll be walking out . Other celebrities who 've shown support so far include Samantha Bee , Ashley Judd , and Padma Lakshmi . So , if you plan to walk out too , you 're in good company . If you 're not totally up-to-date on the news events that predicate the walkout , here 's a quick primer : On Sept. 16 , Dr. Ford spoke publicly for the first time about an alleged sexual assault that had previously only been addressed in an anonymous letter to a senior Democratic lawmaker . According to the Washington Post , Dr. Ford decided that if the assault was going to be talked about , she should be the one leading the conversation . According to Dr. Ford , Kavanaugh and a friend of his , both \" stumbling drunk , \" corralled her into a bedroom one night at a high school party in the suburbs of Maryland . There , she tells the Washington Post , Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and groped her , grinded his body against hers , attempted to pull of her bathing suit , and held his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream . \" I thought he might inadvertently kill me , \" she told the Washington Post . Since identifying herself , Dr. Ford faced endless harassment and death threats from people who do n't believe her story of assault , do n't believe it matters , do n't think Kavanaugh \" should bear decades of the MeToo movement , \" and who just otherwise hate women . Trump first addressed the allegations in a tweet expressing disbelief that someone who went through what Dr. Ford says she went through would keep it to themselves . This prompted people to gather stories of their own unreported sexual assaults under the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport . Countless others expressed solidarity with Dr. Ford using the hashtag #IBelieveChristineFord . And over the weekend , since Trump 's tweet , the walkout was planned to show additional support for Kavanaugh 's now-multiple accusers , and survivors of assault everywhere . After negotiating for several days with Senate Republicans , Dr. Ford is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday , Sept. 27 . Dr. Ford has been adamant and unwavering in her decision to testify before senators about her allegations since coming forward . \" Despite actual threats to her safety and her life , Dr. Ford believes it is important for senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her , \" said lawyers for Dr. Ford in a statement released Sunday . While the second set of accusations from Ramirez-who now faces a potential F.B.I. investigation-could alter the timeline , Dr. Ford is currently set to testify before 21 senators for questioning , according to the New York Times . Whether or not you 're able to participate , you can protest Kavanaugh 's confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice by calling your senators . Several progressive groups launched a website-Whip the Vote-that helps you find out which senators to call by entering your phone number and zip code . They also provide sample scripts , specific to your senator , if you 're not sure what to say . Follow Hannah on Twitter . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

It s got a high-concept that takes a bit of explaining actor who plays a lawyer on TV ( Rob Lowe ) quits his show and heads home to help his brother ( Fred Savage ) at his small law firm , insinuating himself into both the firm and brother s home life . And it s a show that combines old-fashioned gags ( husbands and wives they squabble ! Every workplace contains eccentric characters ! ) with an intense self-consciousness about showbiz that usually dooms a show to low ratings or cult status or cancellation , or all of the above ( hello/goodbye Community , The Comeback , SportsNight , Action ! ) . The Grinder had the funniest pilot episode I watched leading into this past fall s TV season . The chemistry between Lowe and Savage was an unexpected but immediate delight . But the next few episodes fell into repetitions of its initial jokes , and the whole thing felt a little too broad . Related : See Natalie Morales s Behind-the-Scenes Photos From â€˜ The Grinder Set That s changed , however . The Grinder has found its best identity by making a few tweaks that have streamlined and quickened its growth . The key to its ever-evolving quality is that the writers now have a real handle on the title concept : The best episodes manage to make fun of the corny , repetitive law show-within-the-show while also investing the very concept of a grinder as something ennobling . For Dean , being the Grinder , on-screen or off , means constantly striving to be the best you can be , in as he puts it on one episode the everyday struggle for justice . This helps give The Grinder some genuine heart . Lowe , who initially seemed to be playing a variation on the frequently clueless optimist of Chris Traeger on Parks and Recreation , has turned Dean into a vulnerable monster of self-delusion . Yet he s a likable monster , a coddled star who s forever learning new , amusing lessons about what it means to be an ordinary citizen . And Savage s Stewart is n t just a nebbishy pushover he s become a man who , while forever exasperated that his father ( William Devane ) prizes Dean s cheesy celebrity over Stewart s responsible family-man work ethic , has found a way to derail some of his brother s more grandiose ego-trips with a cutting comment or a perfectly time eye-roll . It also helps that the supporting cast is excellent . Mary Elizabeth Ellis makes a fully-rounded human out of Deb , who could have been just another harried wife/mom struggling with a career and kids . Hana Hayes and Connor Kalopsis are the rare TV-sitcom children who are n t one-note put-down brats , and who exhibit considerable acting range . William Devane is terrific as Stewart and Dean s dad he s both funny and believable as a conflicted father , and the series knows how to have fun with him , such as a recent episode that found him setting up a dating app that used as his profile picture a still from Devane in , I believe , his great 1977 Paul Schrader-written B-movie Rolling Thunder.At work , Natalie Morales s Claire never overdoes her deadpan sarcasm , and Steve Little has proven there s life after his immortal performance in Eastbound & Down . The show has done an admirable job of world-building , especially in the deployment of Timothy Olyphant as his most Olyphantian playing a version of himself as the sloe-eyed horndog star of the Grinder spin-off . And Jason Alexander is wonderful in a recurring guest role as the deeply cynical creator of Dean s Grinder it s as though the show had imagined the behind-the-scenes conversations Stephen J. Cannell might have had with James Garner during The Rockford Files , or how Ann Donahue coped with David Caruso on CSI : Miami . The questions now are ( a ) will The Grinder be renewed and ( b ) can it sustain itself ? Given Fox s iffy fortunes these days , it might be wise to renew both this and Grandfathered and see if these freshman shows with strong casts can increase their audiences for a second season . Sustaining the quality of The Grinder , though , may be trickier . The show feels , increasingly , like an impeccable , simultaneous parody of hour-long dramas and family sitcoms a feat that might prove exhausting for its writers . Here s hoping they can keep grinding it out at its current level . The Grinder airs Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on Fox .",

		"paragraph": "LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Kyle Kuzma and the Los Angeles Lakers easily could have surrendered to fatigue on the second night of a back-to-back late in the season against a team fighting for playoff positioning . Instead , the Lakers found the resolve to end a three-game losing streak . Kuzma scored six of his 30 points in overtime and the Lakers swept the three-game season series against the San Antonio Spurs with a 122-112 victory on Wednesday night . Kuzma , who became first rookie in NBA history with 1,200 points , 450 rebounds and 150 3-pointers in a season , made a 3-pointer and a sky hook to start overtime and give the Lakers a lead they would not relinquish . Los Angeles outscored the Spurs 14-4 in the period . '' Tonight I could tell he was n't going to ask to come out of that game . He was going to fight through it , '' Lakers coach Luke Walton said . '' Kuz , it 's fun watching him compete at that level when he gets in that zone . '' LaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points for the Spurs , who lost on back-to-back nights at Staples Center and are tied with Oklahoma City for fifth place in the Western Conference , a half-game behind Utah . The Spurs and Thunder both have three games remaining . '' It 's unreal , but it can happen , '' said Pau Gasol , who had 11 points and 12 rebounds . '' Those guys played with no fear . They have the green light to get them up , they made a lot of tough shots , and it hurt us . '' Dejounte Murray had 23 points , 10 rebounds and six assists , and Patty Mills scored 15 points , but the Spurs lost their seventh straight on the road . Josh Hart had a chance to win it in regulation for the Lakers , but his layup hit the back of the rim and went off the front as time expired . The Lakers swept the Spurs for the first time since 1997-98 , relying on their second unit to fight back from an eight-point deficit in the third quarter . Channing Frye scored 19 points off the bench , and Tyler Ennis added 10 points and seven assists . Walton was pleased with the sweep , but downplayed the idea it represented a significant achievement for a young team . '' To beat them multiple times in a season for a young team that 's kind of finding themselves is a nice accomplishment , but they are most likely still going to the playoffs this year and we 're not , '' Walton said . TIP-INS Spurs : Rudy Gay had 14 points off the bench . ... Manu Ginobili ( rest ) did not play . ... San Antonio was outscored 21-9 in fast-break points , including an 11-2 disparity in the first quarter . ... The Spurs ' magic number to clinch their 21st consecutive playoff berth remains two . Lakers : G Lonzo Ball missed his fourth consecutive game because of a left knee contusion . ... F Brandon Ingram remains in concussion protocol and missed his third straight game . ... The Lakers set a single-season franchise record with 782 3-pointers , breaking the previous mark of 774 in 2013-14 . ... The Lakers wore their Minneapolis throwback uniforms . ALMOST PERFECT Frye was 8 of 9 from the field , but his only miss had his teammates and Walton laughing at the veteran 's expense after whiffing on an uncontested dunk at the start of the fourth quarter . '' It was funny because after that he made that 3 that hit the top of the backboard and fell in . I turned to him and said , ' Stick to that , ' '' Hart said . DEFENSIVE SWITCH Aldridge had 14 points in the first half and 12 more in the third quarter before Walton decided to start double-teaming him . The adjustment worked , forcing Aldridge to become a facilitator . '' He does what he 's supposed to do , get rid of the ball , and now it 's up to the rest of the players to attack and make plays , '' Gasol said . UP NEXT Spurs : Host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday . Lakers : Host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday . --- More AP basketball : https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball",

		"paragraph": "PARIS ( AP ) Rafael Nadal was trying to make the point that time stops for no man . \" You ca n't fight against the age , \" he said , \" and you ca n't fight against the watch . The watch keeps going , always . \" No arguing against that sentiment . Still , it is rather remarkable how Nadal , a French Open champion yet again a week past his 32nd birthday , and Federer , who turns 37 in less than two months , seem to stay forever young . Nadal 's 6-4 , 6-3 , 6-2 victory over Dominic Thiem , who 's 24 , in Sunday 's final gave the Spaniard an 11th title yes , 11th at Roland Garros and 17th Grand Slam trophy overall . At the previous major tournament , the Australian Open in January , Federer won his record 20th such championship . At the Slam before that , the U.S. Open last September , Nadal was the last man standing . And so on . Federer or Nadal has won each of the past six major tournaments , equaling their second-longest stretch of dual dominance . Their other six-Slam streak came from 2008-09 . Their best run was combining to win 11 consecutive majors starting at the 2005 French Open , when Nadal collected No. 1 . \" Sometimes , I see many , many players even good players , top players they go on the court against Rafa on clay , or Roger on hard court or any other surface , and you can almost see that they do n't really believe 100 percent that they can win , \" said Robin Soderling , who pulled off French Open upsets of Nadal in 2009 , and Federer in 2010 . \" They hope that they will win , but they do n't really believe in it . \" It 's quite a different scene in the women 's game these days . Simona Halep 's 3-6 , 6-4 , 6-1 win against Sloane Stephens in Saturday 's final in Paris made the No. 1-ranked Romanian the seventh female champion at the past seven majors . Part of that probably can be traced to Serena Williams ' 16-month absence from the sport 's four most prestigious tournaments because she became a mother . \" Serena being out for the last couple of years has left the door ajar . And there 's been a few young ladies that have come through and had some victories , \" said Halep 's coach , Darren Cahill . \" Over the next two or three years , we 've got a lot of strength and depth in the women 's game . \" Halep was a first-time major champion , as were Caroline Wozniacki ( 2018 Australian Open ) , Stephens ( 2017 U.S. Open ) and Jelena Ostapenko ( 2017 French Open ) . \" We start to believe that anyone can win it , \" Halep said . As much as things change , they stay the same at the top of men 's tennis . In Monday 's rankings , Nadal is No. 1 , Federer is No. 2 . \" Ten years ago , it was Rafa and Roger , \" Juan Martin del Potro said after losing to Nadal in the French Open semifinals , nine years after he lost to Federer at that stage , \" and now it 's always the same . \" Del Potro 's triumph at the 2009 U.S. Open he got past Nadal in the semifinals , then Federer in the final stands alongside Marin Cilic 's title at the same tournament as the only two examples of someone other than Federer , Nadal , Novak Djokovic , Andy Murray or Stan Wawrinka claiming a major over the past 13 years . Of the past 53 , Nadal has won 17 , Federer 16 , Djokovic 12 , and Murray and Wawrinka three apiece . But at the moment , Murray is still recovering from a hip operation in January and his exact date for a return is unknown . Wawrinka is working his way back from knee surgery and lost in the first round at Roland Garros . Djokovic 's is not yet at his best after an elbow procedure he lost in the quarterfinals in Paris to a guy who never had won a Grand Slam match before this French Open . So that leaves Federer and Nadal , healthy and talented as ever . \" This is perfection . They are the best players in the world and are proving that even when your body is not as young as it was , when one still has the drive and is well prepared , nothing replaces talent and strong will , \" said French Open tournament director Guy Forget , a former top-10 player and French Davis Cup and Fed Cup captain . \" The young players are still lagging behind . \" And at Wimbledon , where play begins July 2 , we 'll find out whether Rafa and Roger can keep figuring out how to successfully \" fight against the watch . \" Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich More AP tennis coverage : https://www.apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis",

		"paragraph": "There was an unprecedented variety of excellent dramas this year â€¦ as well as an unprecedented amount of them . But with the range of tone , genre , casting , styles of writing and direction this was truly a ripe year for drama , spreading across network , basic and premium cable , and streaming as well . Here are my picks for the best of them . Fargo ( FX ) : For its bravura storytelling , its beautiful direction , its exceptionally deep-talent cast , its wit , and its heart , Fargo in its second season is the drama to extol above all others this year . The satisfyingly complex true tale of crime , family , and crime families in the frigid Midwest , Fargo burst every week with vivid characterizations , zinger jokes , impeccable 70s music cues , and a rare sense of constant surprise . Mr. Robot ( USA ) : The year s most stylistically adventurous drama presented each episode like a mini-movie the most adventurous American kind , bending narrative form in the manner of directors such as Robert Altman and the Davids Lynch and Fincher . Creator Sam Esmail compelled us to follow his unreliable narrator , Rami Malek s Elliot , down the darkest avenues of corporate behavior , presenting an anarchist fantasy that played like reality . Justified ( FX ) : What a great way to end a great run . Timothy Olyphant and Elmore Leonard-channeler Graham Yost brought the Raylan Givens saga to an end with a final season that brought the show back to its deepest roots : the fundamental feud between Raylan and Walton Goggins Boyd Crowder . This show , with its brilliant casting and snaking storylines , never got the award-love it deserved , but it stayed true to its code of tight-lipped excellence . The Americans ( FX ) : This was the season that tested the premise of The Americans Russian spies living in 1980s suburbia to its limits . Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys Elizabeth and Philip Jennings were forced to come clean to daughter Paige ( Holly Taylor ) , but they still have blood on their hands . The Leftovers ( HBO ) : In its second season , the rich drama about loss , grief , and the unities of various kinds of families increased its outreach , exploring more characters points of view while giving Justin Theroux s Kevin Garvey and Carrie Coons s Nora Durst more challenges than two people ought to be able to endure . That they did is a measure of this show s belief in strength and endurance . HBO , renew The Leftovers now . The Knick ( Cinemax ) : This turn-of-the-century medical show commenced with harrowing scenes of its anti-hero , Clive Owen s Dr. John Thackery trying to kick his addictions , and concluded with the show s most shocking operation ever . In between , director-producer-cinematographer Steven Soderbergh continued to expand the series exploration of city politics , sexual politics , racial politics , and the belief systems of an ever-widening group of characters . Homeland ( Showtime ) : Anticipating headlines out of Syria and espionage in Germany , the current season of Homeland is more scary and more disciplined in its storytelling than at any previous time since the start of its first season , and Claire Danes , Mandy Patinkin , and Miranda Otto as Berlin CIA station chief have given exceptional performances . Rectify ( Sundance TV ) : This beautiful drama , whose pace and quietness is unique on television , deepened the story of accused killer Daniel Holden ( Aden Young ) , and his family s ardent yet always-tested support of him . It s a measure of how vividly all the principal characters are drawn by show creator Ray McKinnon that I d watch a spin-off of any of them , especially Abigail Spencer s flinty Amantha . Empire ( Fox ) : This fun-filled music-industry soap-opera worked as melodrama and as satire , with superb performances from Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard . Henson s Cookie became such a pop-culture phenomenon , the show risked turning into a mere trend , but at its best , creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong ground the show in the firm grasp of family dynamics . The Good Wife ( CBS ) : Always willing to shake things up , show creators Robert and Michelle King decided to have Chris Noth s Peter run for President , with all the campaign intrigue that entails , even as Julianna Margulies Alicia struck out on her own with a home-based law firm that turns up as least as much trouble as it does clients . Which is just the way we like The Good Wife . Better Call Saul ( AMC ) : Spin-offs from big-hit cultural markers are most often disappointments . But in extracting Bob Odenkirk s Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad , monkeying with the time-line , and giving him an eccentric brother ( Michael McKean ) , Better Call Saul took on its own tone , its own rhythm , its own distinctive set of dramatic priorities that rendered it an engrossing , completely different creation than Bad . Ray Donovan ( Showtime ) : The third season gave Liev Shreiber s strong-arm bag-man Ray a couple of flaky , dangerous new clients ( guest stars Ian McShane and Katie Holmes ) and frequently seemed on the verge of splitting into different shows-within-the-show : boxing drama , religious drama , a tale of abuse-survival . Yet the show ended up a unified whole , a strikingly original example of L.A. noir . Marvel s Jessica Jones ( Netflix ) : She s got super-strength , but Krysten Ritter s title character is no spandex-bursting superhero . She s a wily private eye coping with a lot of emotional damage , finding brief comfort in sex with Mike Colter s Luke Cage , but that ends up just complicating her life even further . This was the year s most satisfyingly complex new superhero drama . ( Kudos to Supergirl , though , for capturing a slightly lighter side of feminist crime-fighting with great energy . ) Banshee ( Cinemax ) : When I saw all the acclaim Netflix s Daredevil was getting for its fight scenes , I thought , Have these people not seen Banshee ? From its bare-knuckle brawls to its elaborately choreographed shoot-em-ups , this wonderfully weird saga of crime in Pennsylvania Amish country was the year s most action-packed show .

		"paragraph": "Rose McGowan has cut ties with Asia Argento following allegations of sexual assault , which reportedly led to Argento being dropped as a judge on X Factor Italy . According to an article published by the The New York Times , Argento paid off her former co-star , actor Jimmy Bennett , after he accused her of sexually assaulting him in a hotel room in 2013 when he was 17 and she was 37 . Although Argento -- the girlfriend of late chef Anthony Bourdain -- has admitted the payout occured , she has denied ever having a sexual relationship with Bennett . McGowan released a statement on Monday in which she indicated that although she had forged a close bond with Argento due to their alleged shared experiences of assault by disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , she has now ended the friendship . I first met Asia on a red carpet , but it s only been the past year through our shared experience of the HW case that we have bonded , McGowan explained . Asia was a person who understood my trauma in a way that many others did n t . We were able to talk through them together and champion each other s voices . We even got matching dot tattoos ! Something I had posted on my IG just about a month ago . It s no secret to anyone that I m a blunt , candid , brazen individual vocally -- and I think that s what I really related to Asia the most with , she continued . They were edgy , confrontational , and strong willed with very little care about how much other s liked or disliked them . Rare things to find in women in this industry or the world . McGowan then shared that in an instant everything changed , after Rain Dove , a 28-year-old model whom McGowan stated she has been dating , shared that he had been texting Argento and she had revealed she had slept with Bennett . Rain also shared that Asia had stated that she d been receiving unsolicited nudes of Jimmy since he had been 12 , McGowan said in the statement . Asia mentioned in these texts that she did n t take any action on those images . No reporting to authorities , to the parents , or blocking of Jimmy s social media . Not even a simple message , â€˜ Do n t send me these images . They are inappropriate . McGowan continued to explain how Dove had agreed to go the police with the text messages , which eventually ended up in the press . The 44-year-old actress also shared the back story of how she introduced Dove to Argento in August , after Bourdain s passing . I was with Asia to comfort and support her , McGowan wrote . Rain Dove came to support us both . It was an emotionally chaotic time and Rain Dove suggested we go to Berlin for a couple days to take the mourning out of Asia s home and into a neutral space . So we did . While in Berlin Asia had mentioned that she was being extorted for a large sum of money every month by someone who was blackmailing them with a provocative image . No one in the room knew who the extortionist was . Now we know it to be a reference to this case . \" Rain Dove continued on communicating with Asia occasionally after meeting her -- and their conversations have been their own , McGowan added . I know Rain is a person to whom many high-profile entities consult when they are experiencing social pressures because Rain is good at guiding them through the research confrontation , rehabilitation , and solution process . While they are a person who is good at keeping a secret for those dedicated to making things right -- they are also justice driven . So , it was not a surprise to me that I received that call and the messages from them . I ve referred to Asia in the past as â€˜ My Ride or Die and said very clearly that their friendship comes first . I know that coming to me with those messages must have been hard for Rain because of that so I commend them for their bravery . McGowan then thanked those who have checked on her to see if she is OK , stated she was doing well and said she was sad to lose a friend connection . But what s even more sad is what happened to Jimmy Bennett , she added . Whether or not the extortion case is true -- it was n t fair and it was n t right . It is the type of thing I fight against alongside so many . Asia you were my friend . I loved you . You ve spent and risked a lot to stand with the MeToo movement , McGowan concluded . I really hope you find your way through this process to rehabilitation and betterment . Anyone can be better -- I hope you can be , too . Do the right thing . Be honest . Be fair . Let justice stay its course . Be the person you wish Harvey could have been .

		"paragraph": "On Aug 13 , President Trump gave the final nod for the colossal fiscal 2019 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , thus sanctioning a spending allowance of $ 717 billion for United States national security . Notably , the budget proposed in February got approval from the U.S. Senate last month . This sanction is considered to be the most significant investment in the U.S. military force . No doubt , Trump s approval for the defense policy bill would give a significant boost to the growth prospects of the major defense primes in the country and consequently drive their share price . Highlights of the Bill The NDAA outlines $ 616.9 billion as Pentagon 's base budget , $ 69 billion for overseas contingency operations funding and $ 21.9 billion for nuclear weapons programs under the Energy Department . Impressively , the act authorizes a 2.6 % pay raise for military along with an increase in the active duty forces by 15,600 service members . With this new act , Pentagon aims to expand the size and strength of U.S. military by adding thousands of new recruits to active duty , Reserve and National Guard units , including 4,000 new active duty soldiers . The legislation also authorizes notable investment for military construction , including family housing . While majority of the analysts applauded the signing of the bill in terms of U.S. defense spending , Trump s weaker stance with respect to U.S. government contracts with China s ZTE Corp and Huawei Technologies received serious criticism from lawmakers , both Republic and Democratic . In particular , in the final version of NDAA , Trump lifted an earlier ban on U.S. companies selling to ZTE , allowing China s second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business . Leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies have expressed their concern as they worry that such leniency might raise the risk of espionage . Stocks in the Limelight Notably , since Trump s ascension to presidency , companies in the Aerospace and Defense space have gained the maximum in comparison to other sectors . The recent signing of the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill has perked up prospects of these stocks . In view of this , it seems prudent to divert investors focus to defense stocks that have gained following the authorization of the bill and hold a favorable Zacks Rank # 2 ( Buy ) . You can see the complete list of today s Zacks # 1 Rank ( Strong Buy ) stocks here . Lockheed Martin Corp.LMT The Pentagon s prime contractor , Lockheed Martin , is the manufacturer of the defense department s most vital program , the F-35 fighter jet . The legislation allows procurement of 77 F-35 joint strike fighters for $ 7.6 billion . It also funds spending for F-35 spares , modifications and depot repair capability . Also , the legislation authorizes $ 85 million for UH-60M Black Hawk utility helicopters . Moreover , the budget includes an investment plan for THAAD missiles . Lockheed Martin s share price has gained 0.2 % since Trump signed the bill . Huntington Ingalls Industries , Inc.HII One of the prime beneficiaries of this new spending proposal will be Huntington Ingalls . For more than 100 years , this company has been building ships , aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy at their shipyards in Virginia and Mississippi . The recently signed bill authorizes $ 24.1 billion for shipbuilding to fully fund 13 new battle force ships and accelerate funding for several future ships .

Clothing brand Wildfang released its own version of the infamous I Really Do n t Care Do U ? jacket , but with a noticeably different message : It says I Really Do Care Do n t U ? According to Wildfang , 100 percent of sales from its version will be donated to RAICES , a Texas-based nonprofit organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to underserved immigrant children , families , and refugees . And let s just say that people on social media are loving Wildfang s approach , so much that the jacket has already sold out . In case you somehow missed what happened with the jacket , here s a recap : On June 21 , Melania was on her way to visit detained immigrant children in Texas . When she arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland , she was spotted wearing the khaki green Zara jacket in question . Although the First Lady s spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said that the jacket had no hidden message , her husband aka President Trump had a different explanation , saying it was about \" fake news . \" While it 's unfortunate that Melania chose to use her wardrobe to make a statement so blatantly insensitive , it 's amazing to see brands using it as an opportunity to do good . Though WildFang 's jackets are sold out , they still have t-shirts and bomber jackets available that will also support the cause . Other brands like Lingua Franca have made their own versions with the plan to donate proceeds as well . But , if you 're not looking for a new piece of apparel , the website ireallydocare.com was set up as a way to donate to various organizations that are helping children at the border .

The official said the decision was not final and that the list of Chinese goods would not become final until after the public had a chance to comment .

Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration was planning to release the list , citing two people familiar with the matter . Another source who is familiar with the situation confirmed the Bloomberg report to Reuters . Trump last week said the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $ 500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year .

		"paragraph": "A 16-year-old girl in British Columbia died of toxic shock syndrome related to her tampon use , a coroner found . Sara Manitoski was found dead on an overnight school trip in March 2017 near Vancouver Island , with an unknown cause of death . Her friends left the cabin that morning for breakfast thinking that she was still sleeping , but when they returned she was still in bed with her alarm going off . Staff and students , along with emergency responders , attempted CPR on Manitoski but she did not recover . Now , over a year later , the coroner has determined that she died of toxic shock syndrome , based on the strain of staphylococcus aureus found on a tampon that was in her body . The report states that she also had other signs of TSS , but notes that tampons are not the only cause of the bacterial infection . We know there is an association . And again , it s very rare , Island Health medical health officer Dee Hoyano told CTV Vancouver Island . Certainly we know a person needs to have this particular bacteria to get sick , and then there may be something with tampon use , maybe prolonged tampon use , that puts that risk higher for developing a more widespread infection . Toxic shock syndrome is extremely rare in 2016 there were just 40 reported cases in the United States , and about half were not related to menstruating women , Dr. Mary Jane Minkin , an ob-gyn from Yale University and member of PEOPLE s Health Squad , told PEOPLE . But when TSS does occur , it develops from toxins already present in the body . The first is vaginal colonization with a strain of S. aureus , which can make the toxin the second is production by the S. aureus of the toxin the third is penetration across the vaginal epithelium of enough toxin to cause disease and the fourth is a lack of adequate titers of the neutralizing antibody to the toxin , Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton , executive director of The North American Menopause Society told PEOPLE . And women of younger ages are more susceptible to the disease . Younger women are more likely to get TSS , possibly because of more exposure through tampons or barrier contraceptive use , Pinkerton said . It may also be because they have n t developed the antibodies yet . To reduce the chance of developing TSS , Pinkerton and Minkin recommend swapping out tampons every two to three hours , and avoid sleeping in them overnight . Additionally , it s best to use lower-absorbency tampons to reduce dryness , and to switch off between tampons and pads . However , Minkin said that women should not be overly concerned . The tampons themselves are not contaminated with bacteria , she said . The nasty staph organisms are unfortunately carried by us , not the tampons . So I would encourage all women to pay attention to their health , but not to worry . ",

According to USA Today , Tebow has seen the photo floating around on social media and is n t happy that people are misrepresenting his kneeling as a formal protest . [ Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues are open : Sign up now for free ] The football star turned baseball hopeful was quick to clarify that he s never knelt during the national anthem before any sporting event he s participated in . He went on to accuse critics of twisting the photo to create a false narrative . According to The Score , rapper T.I. reposted the photo of Tebow kneeling on Instagram with a caption that accused the NFL of a double standard for overlooking Tebow s protests . The caption in the reposted photo states that Tebow knelt in protest of abortion laws . Before taking the field Friday night for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies , the Double-A affiliate for the New York Mets , Tebow clarified to USA Today s Josh Peter that his kneeling was always for religious reasons . Tebow added that he s also bothered when people misrepresent photos of him kneeling as a touchdown celebration . National anthem protests continue to be a divisive subject . It was at the heart of President Donald Trump canceling the Philadelphia Eagles visit to the White House this week , and it will remain front and center with the NFL mandating that players stand during the anthem this season . While Tebow himself chooses not to protest during the national anthem , he offered no criticism for those who do .

In his relentless pursuit of Westeros s Iron Throne , the middle child of House Baratheon allowed his daughter , Shireen ( Kerry Ingram ) , to be sacrificed in the penultimate episode of Games of Thrones â€˜ fifth season . Acquiescing to the advice of his chief counsel , Lord of Light priestess Melisandre ( Carice van Houten ) , Stannis ( Stephen Dillane ) watches his only living child and heir being tied to a stake and set ablaze in the vain hope that it will secure his victory against the entrenched Bolton army at Winterfell . That grand triumph did n t come to pass , though . In the Season 5 finale , Mother s Mercy , Stannis s army is handily defeated , and the would-be king himself is executed by Brienne of Tarth ( Gwendoline Christie ) , who vowed to put him six feet under for his involvement in the murder of his younger brother and her beloved boss Renly Baratheon ( Gethin Anthony ) way back in Season 2 . In the version of Mother s Mercy that aired on HBO in 2015 , Stannis faced his death stoically , telling Brienne , Go on . Do your duty . But as an eagle-eyed Reddit fan noted and the preeminent GoT fan site Watchers on the Wall picked up , a copy of the Emmy-winning script that s available on the official Emmys website contains an extra line cut from the episode that allows him a moment of regret for the loved ones he s wronged . When asked by Brienne if he has any last words , Stannis replies , Do you believe in the life to come ? His executioner nods , and he continues : I do n t . But if I m wrong , and you re right â€¦ tell Renly I m sorry when you get there . I do n t imagine I ll see him wherever I m going . And my daughter . Tell her â€¦ tell her â€¦ . At that point , the script s stage directions complete his unfinished thought : Sorry does n t begin to cover what he feels about Shireen . The thought of it brings tears to his eyes , and he s not going to die weeping in front of a woman he does n t know . Instead , Stannis clams back up and instructs Brienne , Do your duty . While those excised words certainly do n t forgive Stannis s actions , there is some small comfort in knowing that he at least felt remorse over condemning his daughter to the stake as he faced his own demise .

Prosecutors and defense attorneys on Wednesday delivered their closing arguments to jurors on the 12th day of the criminal trial against President Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman . From there , jurors in the U.S. District Court case in Alexandria , Va. , will begin considering the 27 witnesses and more than 360 exhibits presented by prosecutors . A verdict in the trial the first borne of charges from special counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia probe could be coming as soon as this week . Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts lodged by Mueller 's team . Here are the charges he faces : Number of counts : 5 Maximum prison sentence per count : 3 years In an indictment unveiled in February against Manafort and his former business partner , Rick Gates , the special counsel laid out what it described as a years-long \" tax scheme \" intended to lower Manafort 's tax bills by hiding his income from U.S. authorities . Manafort worked for years in the 2000s as a consultant for former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych 's pro-Russian Party of Regions . The tens of millions of dollars he earned for this work were put in foreign accounts , and Manafort used that money to fund a lavish lifestyle primarily through international wire transfers , Mueller alleges . Manafort is accused of failing to report this income on his income tax returns , and falsely claiming he had no authority over those foreign accounts . Number of counts : 4 Maximum prison sentence per count : 5 years From 2011 to 2014 , Manafort allegedly failed to file foreign bank account reports , known as FBARs , with the Treasury Department to disclose his control over his overseas accounts . Number of counts : 4 counts of bank fraud 5 counts of bank fraud conspiracy Maximum prison sentence per count : 30 years During the trial , prosecutors alleged that Manafort resorted to bank fraud to obtain loans for himself after Yanukovych was deposed as the leader of Ukraine in 2014 , which dried up Manafort 's lucrative stream of income . Manafort and Gates are accused of defrauding U.S. banks and other lenders by lying about Manafort 's income , debt and the nature of his real estate properties . Prosecutors also allege Manafort and Gates knowingly doctored financial documents . One of Manafort 's accountants testified under immunity during the trial that she had been asked to misrepresent Manafort 's income by Gates . The indictment alleges Manafort falsely claimed that a New York City condo was \" owner-occupied \" instead of rented in order to get more money when applying for a $ 3.4 million mortgage in late 2015 . It also says Manafort defrauded another lender by falsely overstating the 2015 income of one his businesses by more than $ 4 million , among other charges .",

		"paragraph": "On May 19 , the world s spotlight shone brightly on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as they wed at Windsor Castle . Now , it seems , the new couple is stepping out of it . With their next official engagement not set until September , a new report from Vanity Fair says that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have retreated to their country home in the Cotswolds . It s said to be on the grounds of the Great Tew Estate , which is close to the luxurious Soho Farmhouse . It s very clear they want to be private and left alone , a source told Vanity Fair . The property is in the middle of woodland and you would n t know it was there . It is very remote , which is why they like it . It s like a fortress . There s a huge security presence , you ca n t get close . Later in the summer , the couple will likely join the Queen at Balmoral , her summer castle in Scotland . It s quite common for the royals to take an extended holiday this time of year Prince William and Kate Middleton , for example , vacationed in Mustique . In late July , the Queen headed up to her castle in the Scottish Highlands . At this time in 2017 , Prince Charles and Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall , were spotted on a yacht off of Corfu . And with temperatures soaring in London this August ( right now it s 90 degrees in the capital ) , who could blame them ? But , as other outlets have pointed out , the weather may not be the only factor that s contributed to the couple seeking a summertime escape . Between the in-depth media coverage the couple faced in the days leading up to , and right after , their wedding , and the current tabloid drama surrounding Markle s family , it makes sense that they would want to get away . Even before they went to the Cotswolds , some royal reporters like the Daily Express s Richard Palmer said they noticed the two keeping the press at arm s length . And , if rest , relaxation , and privacy is the goal , they certainly have a good option for a getaway in the Cotswolds , a region Vogue has described as a halcyon jumble of bridleways and farmland .

		"paragraph": "The new Frontline production Bannon s War , airing Tuesday on PBS , takes up the conventional narrative about President Trump s most insidious aide and gives it a good shakeup . There is a notion promoted by much of the news media and via Saturday Night Live s caricature of Bannon as a skull-faced Grim Reaper that Bannon has peaked , and his influence on Trump s thinking has waned . Frontline suggests something different : This political strategist s quest to bend the Trump presidency to the desires of his extremist ideology has the president so thoroughly addicted that Bannon remains by Trump s side as a Dr. Feelgood , always ready to pump the presidential veins with more vitriol and venality . The documentary , directed by Michael Kirk , takes a brisk trot through Bannon s career first as a Goldman Sachs financier , then a Hollywood producer , a key editor of the repellent Breitbart News , and a political motivator for everyone from Sarah Palin to Trump . Some of Frontline s emphases yield fresh observations . I had n t really gotten a load of The Undefeated , a Bannon produced and directed propaganda 2011 film about the dazzling virtues of Sarah Palin , designed to capitalize on what Bannon hoped would be a Palin run for the presidency in 2012 . As glimpsed here , The Undefeated is a work of cynical fantasy , one of the first indications that what Bannon was seeking was an empty vessel decorated in bright peacock colors first Palin , then Trump into whom he could pour his poisonous mix of racist nationalism and apocalyptic paranoia . Once Palin fizzled into John McCain s also-ran and Tina Fey s most triumphant joke , Bannon focused on Trump . Here is where Frontline comes to the fore . Michael Kirk is also the director of Frontline s The Choice 2016 , one of the most important films of last year . In choosing to make so prominent in that production former Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault s now famous comment , Every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump , Kirk and Frontline were prescient in predicting and explaining the world we now live in . Bannon s War is , in a way , a followup to The Choice 2016 , because it shows some of the consequences of Trump s own choices . By keeping Bannon at his side , the president continues to try to ram through executive orders and extreme policies , most of which face spirited disagreement from the majority of Americans but , more crucially , supine acquiescence from the Republican Party . Bannon s War suggests that its subject will weather the hive-mind media notion that Bannon is out of favor with the president because the chief strategist threatens Trump s ego as a political celebrity in his own right . This film asserts that Bannon remains what he began as : a self-described disruptor whose work is never done .

		"paragraph": " The \" True Detective \" finale left us with one dangling question : Were we watching a buddy cop comedy all along and we did n't even know it ? The HBO crime drama series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson has been lauded as genius , epic , nothing short of perfect , so there was a lot riding on its big Season 1 finale . Did it deliver ? After HBO Go stopped crashing , that is ? Let 's break it down . Huge spoiler alert , obviously . Do n't read more unless you 've seen the \" True Detective \" Season 1 finale . With scarface/green spaghetti monster/lawnmower man holding his dead father hostage , with Ziploc bags of clear liquid hanging from the ceiling of his little torture shack , the finale kicked off with a feeling of impending , creeptastic doom . [ Related : Let 's Over-Analyze the ' True Detective ' Season Finale Preview ] And then he started showing off his impersonations and accents , from Southern drawl to British aristocracy . And was that a Scottish brogue before he dipped into mentally-stunted bayou talk ? Maybe between all that school painting and grounds-keeping , he stepped inside for some drama classes over the years . Boy 's got range.But one thing 's for sure : We could probably all live without ever seeing filthy , incestuous psychopaths fondling each other ever again , thank you very much.Between the sibling banter , amidst the requisite doll collections and hoarder piles of most serial killers , Mr. Accents spouted some wisdom . Sort of . \" My ascension removes me from the disc in the loop I 'm near final stage , \" he said in his creepy British accent . \" Some mornings , I can see the infernal plane . \" A quick Google search a necessity when you 're watching this show unless you 've studied the hat trick of philosophy , demonic spells , and late 19th century literature reveals that \" infernal plane \" is also referred to as Black Magic , and then there 's this piece of doom-sounding nonsense on the Wikipedia page for Dungeons & Dragons game Gehenna : In the revised cosmology of the Forgotten Realms , the infernal plane of Gehenna was the home of the dark god Bhaal , lord of murder and death , before he was killed in the Time of Troubles . Dark god , lord of murder and death , yadda yadda â€¦ whatever he 's seeing , it 's not great . He 's crazy , in case that was n't obvious . [ Related : ' True Detective 's ' Biggest Clue About the Yellow KingHas Been Right Under Our Noses ] Meanwhile , Rust ( McConaughey ) and Marty ( Harrelson ) were still holding their old boss Steve hostage on that boat , and they showed him the terrifying tape of Marie Fontonaeu . If time is like a flat circle , that tape is like \" The Ring \" â€¦ no one can watch without screaming and begging for mercy.Steve was not really feeling Rust 's philosophical hit man vibe : \" What the f--k is with you man ? \" ( We 've all thought that about Rust at least once this season , right ? ) So when Steve prepared to get in his Maserati and peel out , he had a few final words for Marty and especially Rust : \" I got something coming for you baby your psycho bit do n't curb me boy . You hear me ? \" Then Rust cued his man in the grass to start shooting up the Maserati , barely missing Steve . Cut to reveal it was Rust 's new boss , the bar owner who lost his son years back . Glad he came in handy.We switched gears and found something creepier than lawnmower man and his half-sister getting it on : As old spaghetti monster man painted the side of a school ( interesting to note he was painting a green school a nice shade of yellow ) , he was staring at brunette girls spinning in circles , whistling the creepiest tune ever once again . Someone out there is probably digging up what that song might be , but we 're fine never hearing it again . Seriously . Marty had a case breakthrough finally ! but it was about a house having been painted a nice bright shade of green back in ' 94 . Maybe the killer was n't wearing his hat and got paint all over himself and became the green-eared spaghetti monster ? Maybe ! It seemed like a strange lightbulb moment , but whatever . Cue the car scene of Rust and Marty hot on the trail . [ Related : Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson Talk ' True Detective ' ] \" I never told you how to live your life , Marty â€¦ \" Rust says in his final car monologue of many . \" Everybody judges , all the time . Now , you got a problem with that , you 're living wrong . \" Just keep livin ' , Marty . Just . Keep . Livin ' . After a deep life lesson was spouted once again , all Marty had to say in response was , \" What 's scented meat ? \" He 's a simple man . Then again , we did n't really catch all of that either . Once the guys tracked down the old resident to confirm that she 'd had her house painted back in ' 94 , they asked who did the job . \" They were nice men . They worked for our parish yard work , house painting . \" Sound like anyone else we know ? Ding , ding , ding the boys were on the trail ! Sadly , we 've been there since last week , but it 's an interesting treat after a season of everyone being behind the eight ball to finally have information before the detectives did . Not shocking , the old lady remembered the youngest man had scars across his face , and they were off again . [ Related : 5 Reasons ' True Detective ' Might Be HBO 's Next Great Drama ] But before they could get to the house of horrors , they had time for one more car chat : \" You still see things ever ? , \" Marty asked Rust . \" It never stops , not really . What happened to my head is not something that gets better , \" Rust replied . Good luck tracking that killer with your hallucinating ex-partner you loathe , Marty!But Rust is the least of Marty 's problems because out in the sticks where serial killers live in crazy compounds , you ca n't get a cell signal to save your life . This is where the eerie vibe of the episode got downright horror movie-esque . Marty met Scarface Billy 's half-sister , who told him that his father/their father Old Bill was \" all around us , before you were born and after you die . \" Then he chased her down inside their house and at gunpoint she spouted : \" He 's gon na come for you . He 's worse than anybody , \" in a marble-mouthed voice.Rust was chasing down Scarface Billy , and ended up right in his lair . Billy showed off his other vocal talent : Narrating without ever being seen . Guy can do voices and throw his voice . That makes his \" This is Carcosa \" welcome even more haunting . Just as Rust started hallucinating the cosmos , Scarface Billy came out and stabbed him , blood gushing everywhere , telling him to \" take off your mask . \" Rust does n't go down easy though man , can he headbutt!Marty rushed in shooting like a pro , but that did n't take Scarface Billy down either because , remember , psychopaths do n't really feel pain . Marty got an axe to the chest almost twice before a bleeding , dying Rust blew Scarface Billy 's head off . End scene . This is where the tone of the show shifted to buddy cop delight . With their man caught and reinforcements arriving , the guys realized that through all the fighting , wife-screwing , doubting , and double-crossing , they really only had each other.Marty sat in the hospital , retelling the story to Idiot Present-Day Cops , who identified Scarface Billy , the woman as his half-sister \" at least , \" and the contraband found on the property as evidence from all their crimes and more.And in case you theorists needed further proof that Maggie Hart was not the Yellow King and their eldest daughter Audrey was n't more than a rebellious teen , they all visited dear old dad in the hospital . It 's no happy reunion , but Marty will be fine . [ Related : Michelle Monaghan on ' True Detective 's ' Shocking , Disturbing Resolution ] But where 's Rust ? Fresh out of a coma , he was pretty banged up but alive , meaning we finally got the hospital scene that McConaughey and Harrelson promised us back before the show even premiered , the scene that made them fight off-screen . And it was good . This is when and where their relationship was solidified , their banter taken to new Odd Couple heights . We got a very sweet story about what Rust saw and felt when he almost died and was in his coma , and through that , he and Marty finally started speaking on the same level . As Marty presented Rust with a contraband pack of smokes at the hospital , wrapped in a Tiffany blue box ( \" What , are we getting engaged ? \" ) , the two talked about Rust 's near-death experience and being surrounded by his deceased daughter and father . Then they discussed the stars in the sky when Rust lived in Alaska and , on a deeper level , good versus evil . \" It 's just one story ... the oldest ... Light versus dark , \" Rust said . \" Well I know we ai n't in Alaska , but it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory , \" Marty replied pessimistically . \" Yeah â€¦ you 're right about that , \" Rust said , eventually adding : \" You 're looking at it wrong ... once there was only dark . If you ask me , the light 's winning . \" Pan up to black , end series with these two former enemies leaning on each other , quite literally , and flecks of light shining through . Thoughts ? Did you want more of the guys battling each other , more monologues about definitions fading and warm substances ? Or were you happy they wrapped up the season 's central mysteries and let both of the \" True Detective \" detectives live ?",

		"paragraph": "Frank Underwood s Washington tenure is coming to an end . Netflix is currently in production on a sixth and final season of House of Cards , the landmark drama that signaled its aggressive push into original programming . The final run of House of Cards , which stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright as ruthless and ambitious beltway couple , will debut its last 13 episodes in 2018 . Executive producers Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese , who replaced exiting creator Beau Willimon last year , are both expected to return as co-showrunners . Official word on its conclusion , which has been in the works since the summer , comes at a problematic time for Spacey . The star and executive producer is embroiled in sexual assault scandal , with an actor alleging that Spacey made aggressive advances towards him when he was just 14 . Spacey responded , in turn , by apologizing for inappropriate drunken behavior and coming out as gay . ( Neither the apology nor the admission have been met with a positive response . ) House of Cards has been especially important to Netflix . An adaptation of a British series and Michael Dobbs novel of the same name , news that Spacey and director David Fincher were updating the project as a beltway drama for the U.S. sparked multiple bids from stateside programmers ( including HBO ) before finally going to Netflix with a straight-to-series order for two seasons at a price tag then estimated to be around $ 100 million . This was in 2011 , before streaming had become a dominant player in original programming and when filmmakers such as Spacey and Fincher shifting from movies to television was still somewhat surprising . It premiered in 2013 . The show has seen critical affection wax and wane over the years , but it has remained the de facto flagship at an increasingly diversified Netflix . House of Cards is also a regular favorite at the Emmys , nabbing 46 nominations and 6 wins to date . ( It also boasts a Peabody and two Golden Globes . ) Netflix has changed dramatically around House of Cards , upping its content spend to flabbergasting $ 6 billion annually with more than 30 current series . And while the payoff of its unprecedented gamble is still a work in progress , it has grown its subscriber base substantially recently topping 100 million worldwide users . House of Cards â€˜ renewal also comes at a time of slightly shifting strategy at Netflix . The company only recently made canceling shows a regular practice , announcing relatively quick ends of pricey dramas The Get Down and Sense8 as well as one-off comedy Girlboss . Still , it s batting average remains much stronger than those of its traditional TV competitors . Without any public ratings barometer , recent launches Stranger Things , The Crown , 13 Reasons Why , Dear White People and GLOW have been deemed industry successes on cultural impact alone . Executive produced by Spacey , Fincher , Wright , Dana Brunetti and quite a few other notables , House of Cards is made by Media Rights Capital and Trigger Street Productions .

		"paragraph": "Last week , the sputtering Dallas Cowboys offense woke up in a big way , laying a 40-7 beatdown on the Jacksonville Jaguars . This weekend , they hope to carry that progress on the road where the struggle has been significant against the rival Washington Redskins . Much of the Cowboys problems have been pinned on quarterback Dak Prescott , who has regressed in each of his two seasons since winning Rookie of the Year honors for the 2016 season . Team owner Jerry Jones , who presided over the decision to stick with Prescott over Tony Romo , is not having that . Jones spoke with USA Today at the NFL s owners meetings in New York and put up a staunch defense of his signal-caller , declaring that Prescott s job is safe regardless of how this season plays out . He s long-term , Jones told USA today . Anything we need to see and need to know , I see with him . While Prescott impressed with his legs and and his arm against Jacksonville , he remains statistically one of the least productive quarterbacks in the NFL . His 190.7 yards per game ranks 33rd among quarterbacks while the Cowboys passing attack ranks 29th in the league . But Jones has seen enough to satisfy him . He took umbrage with the categorization that Prescott is simply the bus driver of an offense centered on running back Ezekiel Elliott running behind a powerful offensive line . He s not a â€˜ bus driver , ' Jones told USA Today . He s a weapon . And as mobility diminishes , then you ll pick up where he is with that great decision-making , with the mind he s got . I take offense with any serious , projected criticism about his accuracy . He can get the ball within the circumference of where receivers can catch it . They need to help . Jones is right about one thing . Prescott needs more out of his receivers . But that s not so much on them as it is on Jones failing to procure difference-making weapons for the Cowboys offense . Middling talent produces like middling talent . Dallas has done little to provide Prescott with weapons since the departures of Jason Witten and Dez Bryant . Cole Beasley , Allen Hurns , Tavon Austin and Michael Gallup comprise the top of one of the least imposing wide receiver depth charts in the NFL . But Hurns succeeded in Jacksonville . Bryant succeeded in Dallas with Tony Romo . Both struggled playing with Prescott , who is not an accurate quarterback . Prescott s 62 percent completion rate places him 26th in the league this season among quarterbacks with at least 100 attempts . He completed 62.9 percent of his passes last season . This is not a fluke . It is a problem . The Cowboys sound committed to allowing Prescott to do what he does best , which is make plays with his legs . He s an effective runner and has looked good as a passer when scrambling on broken plays to find receivers downfield . We have to continue to aspire to do that , offensive coordinator Scott Linehan told the Dallas Morning News of drawing up plays that play to Prescott s mobility . While a smart strategy , it seems little more than a Band-Aid and a company line to overlook Prescott s deficiencies . Jones a poor talent evaluator Jones made the decision to move to Prescott two seasons ago , and seems wont to admit he made a mistake . Since winning three Super Bowls in the early 90s with a team built with Jimmy Johnson , Jones has demonstrated little to support that he knows anything about evaluating NFL talent . The odds that he sees something here with Prescott that belies the statistics seem slim .

As Meghan Markle has learned since she first began dating Prince Harry , there s rules and expectations for all aspects of life . But if you thought that the leg crossing and wardrobe choices were confusing enough , just wait until you hear how things work when it comes to having children-especially now that Meghan Markle is expecting their first child next spring . According to reports , the royal family operates with a strange custody agreement when its couples have their own children , which states that , actually , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has full legal custody over the young royals . Royal expert Marlene Koenig explained to news outlets : The sovereign has legal custody of the minor grandchildren . Confused ? It s a seriously backdated regulation , as Koenig continued : This goes back to King George I [ who ruled in the early 1700s ] , and the law s never been changed . He did it because he had a very poor relationship with his son , the future King George II , so they had this law passed that meant the King was the guardian of his grandchildren . The royal family custody law may now be over 300 years old but , officially , it s still standing . That means that on paper , the Queen does have custody over Prince William and Kate Middleton s three children , Prince George , Prince Charlotte and Prince Louis . She 's not like a regular Queen , she 's a cool Queen , and is unlikely to take any authority in how her great-grandchildren are raised but , as Koenig claimed , the Queen does officially have the final call on big decisions , like allowing the royal family kids to travel by plane , for example .

		"paragraph": " It all started with a tweet . A husband s wife was in labor , but they were n t worried about which route to take to the hospital or last-minute debates over baby names . This was shockingly about Fantasy Football and a diehard player named Sara Alton , who was n t going to let anything , even the birth of her second child , get in the way of drafting her team . This takes being a dedicated fantasy player to a whole new level . Sara s league draft had been scheduled well in advance , so she thought it would be fine with a due date of Aug. 23 . However , everything changed when Sara and husband Zach went for a routine checkup last Thursday . We go to the doctor that morning and the doctor said â€˜ you re not leaving . You re probably going to have the baby today , ' Zach recalled . As things were progressing and all timing out we knew we were in big trouble [ when it came to the draft ] . Zach , was n t surprised by Sara s reaction to possibly missing out on drafting her team . She has been playing Fantasy Football for five years and often for higher stakes than the leagues he plays in . I get it . I do n t think anyone wants to auto-draft , Zach said . I want my team to have some human touch . When Yahoo fantasy analyst Liz Loza saw Zach s tweet and the predicament Sara was facing , she knew she had to do something . Liz , a mother of two herself , immediately reached out to Zach to see if she could step in to draft for Sara . Zach was admittedly shocked that someone with Liz s fantasy r sum reached out and offered to help . I think this is a pretty good alternative , Zach told Sara . Mostly I was hoping for virtual sympathy from the world . Sara thought Zach was joking at first when he explained Liz s offer to help , but then quickly bought in . Do you need my password ? she asked Zach , who was communicating with Liz on Twitter . I could go into labor without any worries now because I knew I was in good hands with Liz , Sara said . [ Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues are open : Sign up now for free ! ] So with the parents-to-be in agreement , Liz reached out to Yahoo colleagues to see what could be done from a technical standpoint to get her in the draft room in place of Sara . Liz then jumped in her car to battle infamous 405 traffic in Los Angeles hoping she could make it in time to draft . It was a race against the clock . A fight that the 405 won , at least for the first few rounds . Liz entered the draft room 12 minutes after things started and saw that she had missed the first three rounds with Antonio Brown , Mike Evans and Jordan Howard being taken by auto-draft . I was disappointed I missed the first three picks , but given that auto-draft picks are set to Yahoo experts rankings they worked out , Liz said . In the midst of trying to find out the league settings ( standard , three receivers ) , she took Lamar Miller and Kerryon Johnson . Things started to settle in from there , but she admittedly got caught up in the emotion of drafting for a fellow mom in labor . I ca n t believe this is happening , Liz texted a co-worker in the middle of drafting . Liz could relate to Sara s passion . I had my second [ she s 20 months now ] during Week 15 [ of 2016 ] . That was the second week of the fantasy playoffs , Loza said . I get it ! When the picks were in , Sara was still in labor but wanted to see her team . I really like the Cooper Kupp and Kirk Cousins picks , Sara said after seeing her roster . As for the most important part of the story , Sara and her baby boy are both doing well . Woods Michael Alton was born at 9:07 p.m. on Aug. 16 at St Thomas Midtown Hospital in Nashville . He weighed 7 pounds , 8 ounces and was 20 inches long . Fourteen-month-old Porter is also enjoying playing big sister and helping her parents with Woods . As for Sara s league mates , they did n t seem to mind that she got some expert help with her team for the season . They were cool with it and more excited we had a happy , healthy baby and a happy , healthy fantasy team , Zach said . Liz said this was an experience like nothing else she s had in her years in the industry . What can I say ? Moms deliver ! ",

The Raptors sure wish he 'd stayed back there . After scoring just two points on 1-for-4 shooting in the first half , Butler absolutely exploded after halftime , pouring in 40 points in the third and fourth quarters to lead the Bulls to a 115-113 comeback win . That 40-point second half stands as a new Bulls franchise record for the highest-scoring half in team history ... which is pretty freaking impressive , when you remember who used to line up at the two in Chicago , and whose name now slots in below Butler 's on this particular line in the team record book : Butler made 14 of his 19 field-goal attempts and 10 of 11 free throws after intermission , mixing in hard drives to the rim and face-up jumpers to keep Toronto 's defense off-balance and out of sorts . And the Bulls needed every last one of those 40 points to pull off the come-from-behind win . Playing without injured stars Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah , the Bulls trailed by 12 at halftime , but Butler 's 21-point third quarter got Chicago within six heading into the fourth . The Raptors made a push to start the period , building the lead back to a dozen on a 3-pointer by veteran power forward Luis Scola with six minutes remaining in regulation . From there , though , Butler took over . The 26-year-old either scored or directly assisted on 18 of Chicago 's final 24 points in the closing six minutes , including a wild triple from the right corner with Carroll draped all over him to put the Bulls up 112-111 with 30 seconds remaining that prompted young Mr. Butler to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help him God : Butler said after the game that Carroll 's elbow had nothing to do with his ultra-assertive second half : ... but Jimmy sure did seem to look like a different dude once he got patched up and crossed those white lines again : As Butler spread his wings and soared , the Raptors seemed to tighten up and shrivel . Point guard Kyle Lowry mostly brilliant on Sunday , scoring 22 points with 10 assists and five rebounds in a game-high 39 minutes tried to answer Butler 's bomb by barrelling into the teeth of the Bulls defense and forcing a layup try , but came up empty , leading to a rebound by Bulls center Pau Gasol and a split pair of free throws that put Chicago up two with 23 seconds left . A similar foray into one-on-one ball by backcourt partner DeMar DeRozan who 'd scored a team-high 24 points to that point resulted in another tightly contested miss , another Chicago rebound and another split pair that pushed the lead to three with 15 seconds left . After a Jonas Valanciunas putback dunk of a missed Carroll 3 and Butler hitting one of two from the line to break Jordan 's single-half franchise scoring record , Toronto had one last chance at an equalizer or winner ... ... but DeRozan 's last-ditch triple try went awry , sealing a two-point win in a game that Chicago once trailed by 15 points and looking for all the world like something that could serve as a rallying point for a Bulls club that 's been working through its fair share of adversity much of it centering on Butler 's at-times stumbling efforts to take an increased leadership role in recent weeks : Whether Butler , whom Bulls brass gave a five-year , $ 95 million maximum salaried contract last summer , is the official/unofficial/whatever \" leader \" of the Bulls as they exist now remains unclear . What does seem clear , though , is that he 's hell-bent on earning every cent he can , playing pivotal late roles in wins over conference rivals Indiana and Toronto that have the Bulls on a four-game winning streak and sitting in second place in the East at 20-12 , and that have elevated him into the ranks of those whose names come up when you discuss the best two-way players in the game . All things being equal , though , Butler would prefer we not bring his name up when we discuss that other Bulls shooting guard whose record he broke on Sunday : For one half of basketball , though , you sure could have fooled the Toronto Raptors .

Related : Watch : Meghan McCain Slams White House for Not Firing Aide Who Mocked Her Father s Cancer A host on the Fox News show , Steve Doocy , asked Sanders , What the heck is going on ? regarding White House aide Kelly Sadler s alleged remark last Thursday that McCain s opposition to President Donald Trump nominating Gina Haspel for CIA director does n t matter , he s dying anyway . In another leak from an internal staff meeting Friday , White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp allegedly said , You can put this on the record â€¦ I stand with Kelly Sadler . Trending : An Alien Planet 's Tilt Could Kill Life , Even in a ' Habitable Zone ' Look , I can tell you there are a couple of bad actors , said Sanders , adding that leaking is disgusting and some of the most shameful behavior that you could ever engage in . It s an honor and privilege to work for the president and to be part of his administration . Anybody who betrays that , I think is a total and complete coward and they should be fired , Sanders said . We fired people over leaking before . I have personally fired people over leaking before . And we certainly would be very willing to do so again .

I do n t think we should continue to validate the leaks that come out by making that the focus of what we re doing , Sanders said .

		"paragraph": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have been together for almost a year and a half and the couple have been engaged for about three months , which seems like enough time for Turner to get used to feeling like she s in a fishbowl , as she once told Glamour . It is not enough time for some onlookers to get over a simple fact about this couple : At a reported 5 9 , the Game of Thrones star is taller than her 5 7 DNCE fianc . The paparazzi caught the two walking out in unseasonably warm weather in New York City over the weekend , with Turner wearing a pair of boots with tall chunky heels as Jonas strolled along in his Converse . Gossip site Just Jared posted a photo of them to Instagram , and immediately the comments section became host to a load of criticisms over their height difference . She is sooooo much taller than him , noticed @aurmichkell . And why does she wear such high heels ? wondered @csre27 . I mean , there s nothing wrong with being taller than your partner , but it just seems uncomfortable to accentuate it like that . So â€¦ Joe is the little spoon , wrote @amandachristy12 . And @geronimogl was meaner , joking , Caption should say , Sophie s fiancee and her little bitch ! When they first started dating , a couple of tabloids made a big deal about their height difference , but they re hardly the first celebs to demonstrate that sometimes taller women like men who are ever-so-slightly shorter than them . See also : Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban ( or Tom Cruise ) , Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden , Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik . Jonas has dated other statuesque women , such as Taylor Swift and Hadid . Why do people get so fixated on this kind of pairing ? Does it have any bearing on the internal workings of their relationship ? A lot of that depends on the couple s past , New York-based relationship therapist Jean Fitzpatrick tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Because we think of man-as-taller as â€˜ normal , sometimes this height difference sparks anxiety , usually at first , Fitzpatrick says . A very tall woman may have felt like a giant growing up and dating , and may sometimes wish for a guy who feels like her match in height . A shorter man may have been the smallest guy on the team and so dating a taller woman may be an uncomfortable reminder of shame he has n t worked through yet . The biggest height difference any of us experiences in life is the one we have with our parents growing up . When we were small and they were tall , we felt taken care of and loved , or deprived and judged , or both . But none of that baggage is insurmountable , Fitzpatrick notes , particularly if both parties are willing to talk about it . There s one way in which Turner and Jonas are already getting past one shorter-man stereotype : Tallness in men is associated with career success , which is n t an issue for couples who are already successful , Fitzpatrick says . And with today s partnership marriages , I find couples less interested in height and more in sharing career , household , and parenting equitably . Fitzpatrick says there are much more important questions they ll have to face together than physical differences . Once a couple have been together awhile , it s the quality of the relationship that matters : Do they listen to and understand each other ? Do they express care for each other in everyday ways ? Do they trust each other ? she says . Regardless of height , Jophie look pretty happy together , as they begin to plan their wedding , which will feature Maisie Williams as a bridesmaid and some kind of speech ( or more ) from Nick Jonas . Then we re betting Turner s choice of footwear will have everything to do with her dancing plans , not her groom s height .
